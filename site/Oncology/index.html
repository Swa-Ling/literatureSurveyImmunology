        <tr id="The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has threatened human health worldwide. Among protective immune reactions, T cell responses are diverse among individuals, which is related to the differences in severity. A T cell subset, regulatory T (Treg) cells, is crucial for limiting excessive immune responses. If SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs are developed during infection, they may counteract anti-viral immunity and cause severe symptom. To address this possibility, we conducted single-cell TCR-RNA-sequencing of PBMCs from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Among thirteen donors, one with severe symptom had substantially more FOXP3-expressing Treg clonotypes activated in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virion or other major antigen proteins. To define the reactivity of these Treg clonotypes, fifteen highly expanded Treg clonotypes were reconstituted into reporter cells and stimulated with 27 distinct peptide pools that cover all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However, none of these clonotypes react to any SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Instead, the reporter cells expressing one TCR clonotype (23599) were activated in the presence of EBV-transformed B cells without adding exogenous antigens. Furthermore, 23599 TCR-expressing cells were activated by non-transformed naïve syngenic B cells in DQA1*03:03-DQB1*04:01-dependent manner, suggesting that clonotype 23599 may be autoreactive. This Treg clonotype, 23599, was also detected in a public TCR database, and significantly expanded in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not the dominant antigen inducing Treg during infection.">

        <tr id="Severity of COVID-19 is affected by multiple factors; however, it is not understood how the inflammatory milieu of the lung at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure affects the control of viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that immune events in the mouse lung closely preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection affect viral control and identify innate immune pathways that limit viral replication. Pulmonary inflammatory stimuli including resolved, antecedent respiratory infections with Staphylococcus aureus or influenza, ongoing pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, ovalbumin/alum-induced asthma, or airway administration of TLR ligands and recombinant cytokines all establish an antiviral state in the lung that restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to antiviral type I interferons, TNFα and IL-1 potently precondition the lung for enhanced viral control. Our work shows that SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from an immunologically quiescent lung microenvironment and suggests that heterogeneity in pulmonary inflammation preceding SARS-CoV-2 exposure may contribute to variability in disease outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is accompanied by elevated liver enzymes, and patients with pre‐existing liver conditions experience more severe disease. While it was known that SARS‐CoV‐2 infects human hepatocytes, our study determines the mechanism of infection, demonstrates viral replication and spread, and highlights direct hepatocyte damage. Viral replication was readily detectable upon infection of primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells with the ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2, Delta, and Omicron variants. Hepatocytes express the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor ACE2 and the host cell protease TMPRSS2, and knocking down ACE2 and TMPRSS2 impaired SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Progeny viruses released from infected hepatocytes showed the typical coronavirus morphology by electron microscopy and proved infectious when transferred to fresh cells, indicating that hepatocytes can contribute to virus spread. Importantly, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection rapidly induced hepatocyte death in a replication‐dependent fashion, with the Omicron variant showing faster onset but less extensive cell death. C57BL/6 wild‐type mice infected with a mouse‐adapted SARS‐CoV‐2 strain showed high levels of viral RNA in liver and lung tissues. ALT peaked when viral RNA was cleared from the liver. Liver histology revealed profound tissue damage and immune cell infiltration, indicating that direct cytopathic effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 and immune‐mediated killing of infected hepatocytes contribute to liver pathology.">

Single-cell transcriptomics has provided the scope of investigating cellular and molecular underpinnings of host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high resolution. In this review, we have systematically described the virus-induced dysregulation of relative abundance as well as molecular behavior of each innate and adaptive immune cell type and cell state during COVID-19 infection and for different vaccinations, based on single-cell studies published in last three-four years. Identification and characterization of these disease-associated specific cell populations might help to design better, efficient, and targeted therapeutic avenues.">

Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B and T lymphocytes in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

Although serum antibody levels can be measured to retrospectively diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, peptide stimulation of memory T cell responses is a more sensitive approach. This is because robust memory T cells are generated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and persist even after antibodies wane below detectability thresholds. In this study, we compare T cell responses using FluoroSpot-based methods and overnight stimulation of whole blood with SARS-CoV-2 peptides followed by an ELISA. Both approaches have comparable sensitivity and specificity but require different equipment and samples to be used. Furthermore, the elimination of peptides that cross-react with other coronaviruses increases the assay specificity but trades off some sensitivity. Finally, this approach can be used on archival, cryopreserved PBMCs. This work shows comparative advantages for several methods to measure SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses that could be utilized by any laboratory studying the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.">

With the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, multidisciplinary initiatives were launched to explore new diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccination strategies. From this perspective, proteomics could help to understand the mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify new therapeutic options. A TMT-based quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis was performed to study the proteome remodeling of human lung alveolar cells expressing human ACE2 (A549-ACE2) after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Detectability and the prognostic value of selected proteins was analyzed by targeted PRM. A total of 6802 proteins and 6428 phospho-sites were identified in A549-ACE2 cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The differential proteins here identified revealed that A549-ACE2 cells undergo a time-dependent regulation of essential processes, delineating the precise intervention of the cellular machinery by the viral proteins. From this mechanistic background and by applying machine learning modeling, 29 differential proteins were selected and detected in the serum of COVID-19 patients, 14 of which showed promising prognostic capacity. Targeting these proteins and the protein kinases responsible for the reported phosphorylation changes may provide efficient alternative strategies for the clinical management of COVID-19.">

Coronavirus interactions with host innate immune antiviral responses are an important determinant of disease outcome. This review compares the host's innate response to different human coronaviruses. Host antiviral defenses discussed in this review include frontline defenses against respiratory viruses in the nasal epithelium, early sensing of viral infection by innate immune effectors, double-stranded RNA and stress-induced antiviral pathways, and viral antagonism of innate immune responses conferred by conserved coronavirus nonstructural proteins and genus-specific accessory proteins. The common cold coronaviruses HCoV-229E and -NL63 induce robust interferon signaling and related innate immune pathways, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 induce intermediate levels of activation, and MERS-CoV shuts down these pathways almost completely.">

        <tr id="Abstract As the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus continues to evolve and infect the global population, many individuals are likely to suffer from post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Manifestations of PASC include vision symptoms, but little is known about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and impact the retinal cells. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and perturb the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in vivo, after intranasal inoculation of a transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in cell culture. Separate lentiviral studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mediates viral entry and replication in RPE cells, while the Envelope and ORF3a proteins induce morphological changes. Infection with major variants of SARS-CoV-2 compromised the RPE barrier function and phagocytic capacity. It also caused complement activation and production of cytokines and chemokines, resulting in an inflammatory response that spread across the RPE layer. This inflammatory signature has similarities to that associated with the onset of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of human blindness, resulting from RPE pathology that eventually leads to photoreceptor cell loss. Thus, our findings suggest that post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the RPE may have long-term implications for vision, perhaps comparable to the increased occurrence of AMD found among individuals infected by HIV, but with greater public health consequences due to the much larger number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in over 7 million confirmed deaths. In addition to severe respiratory and systematic symptoms, several comorbidities increase the risk of fatal outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing conditions in patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. Recent clinical studies have reported the reactivation of human herpesviruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), in severe COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. To support these clinical observations, we established a KSHV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection system in A549-hACE2 cells. Our findings indicate that co-infection with live SARS-CoV-2 sharply induces KSHV lytic reactivation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in global cellular gene expression in KSHV-infected A549-hACE2 cells, both with and without SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. These data provide a molecular basis for understanding whether patients with pre-existing oncogenic herpesvirus infections are at increased risk for more severe COVID-19 or for developing virus-associated cancers even after full recovery from COVID-19.">

This study examined the presence of SARS-CoV-2 microRNA (miRNA)-like small RNAs in extracellular fluids and their potential link to PASC by using a quantitative stem-loop RT-PCR MiRNA assay. Initially, it was demonstrated that three previously identified SARS-CoV-2 miRNA-like small RNAs, specifically svRNA 1 and 2 and miR-07a, were significantly expressed in infected cells in vitro and released into the supernatant following infection by different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Then, the expression of three SARS-CoV-2 small RNAs was studied in both nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and sera from 24 patients at their initial COVID-19 diagnosis (T0) and in sera collected 91 to 193 days post-diagnosis (T1). Notably, 11 out of 24 patients (46%) reported PASC consequences. All NPS samples showed SARS-CoV-2 small RNA expression with an altered cytokine network during acute infection, but it did not correlate with PASC outcomes. Serum samples had similar small RNA statuses, though PASC patients, notably at T1, but not at T0, displayed reduced overall positivity compared to those without PASC. The host target expression of SARS-CoV-2 small RNAs was not significantly different between groups. This suggests a need for further research into SARS-CoV-2 small RNA and its role in viral behavior and PASC consequences.">

        <tr id="Introduction The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, notably delta and omicron, has significantly accelerated the global pandemic, worsening conditions worldwide. However, there is a lack of research concerning the molecular mechanisms related to immune responses and metabolism induced by these variants. Methods Here, metabolomics combined with transcriptomics was performed to elucidate the immunometabolic changes in the lung of hamsters infected with delta and omicron variants. Results Both variants caused acute inflammation and lung pathology in intranasally infected hamsters. Principal component analysis uncovered the delta variant significantly altered lung metabolite levels between the pre- and post-infection states. Additionally, metabolic pathways determined by assessment of metabolites and genes in lung revealed significant alterations in arginine biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism upon infection with both variants and closely linked to inflammatory cytokines, indicating immune activation and oxidative stress in response to both variants. These metabolic changes were also evident in the serum, validating the presence of systemic alterations corresponding to those identified in lung. Notably, the delta variant induced a more robust metabolic regulation than the omicron variant. Discussion The study suggests that multi-omics is a valuable approach for understanding immunometabolic responses to infectious diseases, and providing insights for effective treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to numerous cases of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), worldwide. This co-infection has increased patient mortality due to the lack of efficient bi-targeted drugs. Cambogin, a bioactive natural product, has been shown to effectively induce regression of KSHV-latently infected tumours in xenograft mice models; however, its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Here, we report that Cambogin targets 46 host genes commonly affected by both SARS-CoV-2 and KSHV infections, as identified through bioinformatics analysis. These genes are related with 14 key upstream signalling pathways, particularly those involved in inflammation regulation, protein phosphorylation, metabolic processes, and cellular stress response. Within the transcriptional factor (TF)-miRNA co-regulatory network, ten out of 46 hub-target genes are closely linked to Cambogin and KSHV/SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, Cambogin not only efficiently blocks the replication and virion production of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo by reducing the expression of EGFR and Cyclin A2, but also simultaneously inhibits both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the growth of KSHV-induced tumours in vivo using a murine xenograft model. These findings provide an alternative strategy for the potential use of Cambogin in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients, particularly those with KSHV co-infection.">

        <tr id="Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

Understanding the mechanisms of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for addressing COVID-19–related liver pathology and developing targeted therapies. This editorial discusses the significance of ACE2 in hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, drawing on the research by Jacobs et al . Their findings indicate that hepatic ACE2 expression, frequency of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and severity of liver injury are elevated in patients with pre-existing chronic liver diseases.

        <tr id="Neutrophils, particularly low-density neutrophils (LDNs), are believed to contribute to acute COVID-19 severity. Here, we showed that neutrophilia can be detected acutely and even months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and mice, while neutrophil depletion reduced disease severity in mice. A key factor in neutrophilia and severe disease in infected mice was traced to the chemokine CXCL12 secreted by bone marrow cells and unexpectedly, endothelial cells. CXCL12 levels were negatively correlated with LDN numbers in longitudinal analyses of patient blood samples. CXCL12 blockade in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice increased blood/lung neutrophil numbers thereby accelerating disease progression without changing lung virus titers. The exaggerated mortality caused by CXCL12 blockade can be reversed by neutrophil depletion. In addition, blocking interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) reduced CXCL12 levels, suggesting a signal transduction from virus-mediated ACE2 ligation to increased CXCL12 secretion. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of CXCL12 in diminishing neutrophilia, including low density neutrophilia, and its deleterious effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results also support the involvement of SARS-CoV-2-endothelial cell interactions in viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Understanding the early interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human airway epithelial cells is essential for unraveling viral replication and spread mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the early dynamics of airway epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection using well-differentiated human nasal and tracheal epithelial cell cultures by incorporating three publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We identified a previously uncharacterized cell population, termed virus-rich intermediate (VRI) cells, representing an intermediate differentiation stage between basal and ciliated cells. These VRI cells exhibited high viral loads at all infection time points, strong interferon and inflammatory responses, increased mRNA expression of microvilli-related genes (PAK1, PAK4, VIL1), and suppression of apoptosis markers (BAX, CASP3) alongside increased anti-apoptotic gene expression (BCL2). Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that VRI cells send signals to basal cells via receptor-ligand pathways such as EPHA and VEGF, likely promoting basal cell differentiation and proliferation through MAPK signaling. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes VRI cells as a primary site for replication and spread, leveraging these cells’ unique differentiation state to evade host cell death and facilitate viral propagation. This study provides insights into the early cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights potential therapeutic targets to limit viral spread.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the worst pandemics in human history. The causative virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can invade host cells in multiple organs by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II expressed on the cell surface. Once inside the host cell, viral replication takes place, leading to cellular disruption and the release of signal molecules that are recognised by the innate immune system. Innate immunity activation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and primes the adaptive immune system. The proinflammatory environment defends against further viral entry and replication. SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to lead to myocardial injury through several mechanisms. Firstly, direct viral-mediated cellular invasion of cardiomyocytes has been shown in in vitro and histological studies, which is related to cellular injury. Secondly, the proinflammatory state during COVID-19 can lead to myocardial injury and the release of protein remnants of the cardiac contractile machinery. Thirdly, the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is associated with thromboembolism of coronary arteries and/or other vascular systems. COVID-19 patients can also develop heart failure; however, the underlying mechanism is much less well-characterised than for myocardial injury. Several questions remain regarding COVID-19-related heart failure, including its potential reversibility, the role of anti-viral medications in its prevention, and the mechanisms underlying heart failure pathogenesis in long COVID-19. Further work is required to improve our understanding of the mechanism of cardiac sequelae in COVID-19, which may enable us to target SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients against longer-lasting cardiovascular complications.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the respiratory system and other organ systems. Tissue injuries resulting from viral infection and host hyperinflammatory responses may lead to moderate to severe pneumonia, systemic complications, and even death. While anti-inflammatory agents have been used to treat patients with severe COVID-19, their therapeutic effects are limited. GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) is a pro-inflammatory receptor expressed on vascular endothelial cells, regulating leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a GPR4 antagonist, NE-52-QQ57, in the SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Our results demonstrated that GPR4 antagonist treatment increased the survival rate in this severe COVID-19 mouse model. The inflammatory response, characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was reduced in the GPR4 antagonist group compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, both SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and infectious viral titers in the mouse lung were decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive mouse brains was also decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, the GPR4 antagonist inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero E6 cells. Together, these results suggest that GPR4 antagonism may be explored as a novel approach for the treatment of COVID-19 and other similar viral diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has profoundly impacted global health, with pneumonia emerging as a major complication in severe cases. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is marked by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an excessive inflammatory response, resulting in oxidative stress and significant tissue damage, particularly in the respiratory system. Antioxidants have garnered considerable attention for their potential role in managing COVID-19 pneumonia by mitigating oxidative stress and modulating immune responses. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the use of antioxidants in hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Studies exploring antioxidants, including vitamins, trace elements, nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O3), glutathione (GSH), L-carnitine, melatonin, bromelain, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and numerous polyphenols, have yielded promising outcomes. Through their ROS-scavenging properties, these molecules support endothelial function, reduce the thrombosis risk, and may help mitigate the effects of the cytokine storm, a key contributor to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Clinical evidence suggests that antioxidant supplementation may improve patient outcomes by decreasing inflammation, supporting immune cell function, and potentially shortening recovery times. Furthermore, these molecules may mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19 by exerting direct antiviral effects that inhibit the infection process and genomic replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. Moreover, antioxidants may work synergistically with standard antiviral treatments to reduce viral-induced oxidative damage. By integrating findings from the literature with real-world data from our clinical experience, we gain a more profound understanding of the role of antioxidants in managing COVID-19 pneumonia. Further research combining comprehensive literature reviews with real-world data analysis is crucial to validate the efficacy of antioxidants and establish evidence-based guidelines for their use in clinical practice.">

In turn, the metabolic status shapes the diverse ILC2 phenotypes and effector functions. Hence, deciphering the metabolic networks of ILC2s is essential in understanding ILC2’s roles in health as well as pathophysiologies. Here we detail a framework of experimental approaches to study key immunometabolic states of primary murine ILC2s and link them to phenotypes and functionality. Utilizing flow cytometry, Single Cell ENergetIc metabolism by ProfilIng Translation inhibition (SCENITH) as well as the Seahorse platform we provide a framework that allows in-depth analysis of cellular bioenergetic states to determine the immunometabolic wiring of ILC2. Linking immunometabolic states and networks to ILC2 phenotypes and effector functions will allow in-depth studies that assess the potential of novel pharmaceutics to alter ILC2 functionality in experimental and clinical settings.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, driven by the novel coronavirus and its variants, has caused over 518 million infections and 6.25 million deaths globally, leading to a significant health crisis. Beyond its primary respiratory impact, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in various extra-pulmonary complications. Research studies reveal that the virus affects multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system (CNS), largely due to the widespread expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. Clinical evidence shows that the virus can induce diabetes by disrupting pancreatic and liver functions as well as cause acute kidney injury. Additionally, neurological complications, including cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation, have been observed in a significant number of COVID-19 patients. This review discusses the mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 to acute kidney injury, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), emphasizing its effects on pancreatic beta cells, insulin resistance, and the regulation of gluconeogenesis. We also explore how SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological complications, detailing the intricate pathways of neuro-invasion and the potential to trigger conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). By elucidating the metabolic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, this review underscores the imperative for continued research and the development of effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term and short-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background: Investigation of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants and COVID-19 vaccination on inflammatory and immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited in South Asia. Objectives: We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 vaccination and waves of COVID-19 on inflammatory and immunological biomarkers among COVID-19 patients in India. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of vitamin D and zinc during COVID-19 infection in India (N=181). Blood samples and data regarding vaccination doses were collected. The second (Delta) or third (Omicron) wave was determined by date of enrolment. Mixed effects linear regression with robust standard errors was used to examine associations between COVID-19 vaccination dose or wave at enrolment and C-Reactive Protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM). Results: Compared to no vaccination, full vaccination was associated with lower LDH (P<0.001), D-dimer (P=0.521) and Ang-2 (P=0.046), and higher IgG levels (P<0.001). Partial vaccination was associated with lower IL-6 (P=0.040) and higher IgG (P<0.001). Enrolment during the third wave was associated with lower IL-6 (P<0.001), CRP (P=0.056), IgM (P=0.013), and IgG (P<0.001), but higher D-dimer levels (P<0.001). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination status and SARS-CoV-2 variant influence the inflammatory and immunologic response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the severity of clinical presentation.

        <tr id="Compromised male reproductive health, including reduced testosterone and sperm count, is one of the long COVID symptoms in individuals recovering from mild-severe disease. COVID-19 patients display testicular injury in the acute stage and altered serum fertility markers in the recovery phase, however, long-term implications on the testis remain unknown. This study characterized the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on testis function. The K18-hACE2 mice that survived SARS-CoV-2 infection were followed for one month after infection and the testicular injury and function markers were assessed at different stages of infection and recovery. The long-term impact of infection on key testes function-related hormones and male fertility was measured. The efficacy of inflammation-suppressing drug in preventing testicular injury was also evaluated. The morphological defects like sloughing of spermatids into the lumen and increased apoptotic cells sustained for 2–4 weeks after infection and correlated with testicular inflammation and immune cell infiltration. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of inflammatory, cell death, and steroidogenic pathways. Furthermore, reduced testosterone levels associated with a transient reduction in sperm count and male fertility. Most testicular impairments resolved within one month of infection. Importantly, dexamethasone treatment attenuated testicular damage, inflammation, and immune infiltration. Our results implicate virus-induced cytokine storm as the major driver of testicular injury and functional impairments, timely prevention of which limits testis damage. These findings serve as a model for evaluating therapeutics in long COVID patients and may guide clinical strategies to improve male reproductive health outcomes post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are a major cause of diarrheal disease, yet critical aspects of their biology, including cellular tropism, remain unclear. Although research has traditionally focused on the intestinal epithelium, the hypothesis that HuNoV infects macrophages has been recurrently discussed and is investigated here using a zebrafish larval model. Through single-cell RNA sequencing of dissected zebrafish intestines, we unbiasedly identified macrophages as host cells for HuNoV replication, with all three open reading frames mapped to individual macrophages. Notably, HuNoV preferentially infects actively phagocytosing inflammatory macrophages. HuNoV capsid proteins and double-stranded RNA colocalized within intestinal macrophages of infected zebrafish larvae, and the negative-strand RNA intermediate was detected within FACS-sorted macrophages. Flow cytometry confirmed viral replication within these macrophages, constituting approximately 23% of HuNoV’s host cells. Identifying macrophages as host cells prompts a reevaluation of their role in HuNoV pathogenesis, offering new directions for understanding and controlling this infection.">

        <tr id="Diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) represent two public health emergencies. In severe disease, both pathogens may share a biological niche in the lower respiratory tract. There is significant potential for SARS-CoV-2 and M.tb infections to be co-present within individuals and enhance or moderate the respective outcomes of either infection. Here, we investigated how whole blood samples, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, from individuals hospitalised with acute COVID-19 disease respond to mycobacterial challenge. To do this, samples were assessed by ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assays, immune cell phenotyping by mass cytometry, and whole blood cytokine responses to mycobacterial antigens assessed by flow cytometry. These studies identified a subgroup of COVID-19 patients whose blood had an enhanced capacity to inhibit mycobacterial growth. The ability to control mycobacterial growth was associated with the presence of a non M.tb-specific CD28+ CD8+ T cell population, with a particular activation status and migratory phenotype. This work improves our understanding of factors involved in mycobacterial control, and may contribute to the design of novel therapies for TB.">

        <tr id="Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is an uncontrolled plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow, leading to immune dysregulation with impaired humoral immune responses. Conversely, cellular-based responses play a vital role in MM patients. However, the extent and duration of cellular-induced protection remain unclear to date. Here, immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) like Lenalidomide (Lena) become interesting, as they may have stimulatory effects on T-cell functioning. Methods In this study we investigated immune responses elicited by COVID-19 vaccine or infection comparing 43 healthy volunteers (avg. 35y, 72.1% female, 81.4% previously COVID-19 infected), with 41 MM patients under Lena maintenance therapy (avg. 63.8y, 51.2% female, 61% previously COVID-19 infected). Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), spike-RBD, and nucleocapsid (N) were measured via ELISA in subjects’ plasma. Freshly isolated PBMCs, incubated with SARS-CoV-2 peptides (N, S), activation induced marker (AIM) assays and flow cytometry, allowed us to assess cellular responses (CD8+ T, T(F)H: CD4+ T (follicular) helper). Results Whereas healthy controls showed significant better humoral responses (N IgA p<0.001), T cell responses were robust in the MM group (higher S-act. TH, p<0.001). Stratified by COVID-19 status, the MM group showed higher N-act. TH (p=0.03). These results were unchanged comparing a Lena intake with Lena break around vaccination. Discussion Taken together, MM patients under Lena therapy exhibit weakened antibody production but present a robust T cell response following SARS-COV-2 infection or vaccination. Our results highlight the importance of vaccination in this subgroup and moreover, argue against a Lena intake break around the time of vaccination.">

Here, we show the strong association of protective cellular immunity with mild COVID-19 and unique cell types against SARS-CoV-2 virus in an HLA-A2 restricted manner. ELISpot assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in mild COVID-19 patients are significantly higher than in severe patients, whereas neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 virus significantly correlate with disease severity. Single-cell analyses of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells, which recognize highly conserved immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes, demonstrate divergent profiles in unvaccinated patients with mild versus severe disease. CD8+ T-cell types including cytotoxic KLRB1+ CD8αα cells with innate-like T-cell signatures, IFNGhiID3hi memory cells and IL7R+ proliferative stem cell-like memory cells are preferentially observed in mild COVID-19, whereas distinct terminally-differentiated T-cell subsets are predominantly detected in severe COVID-19: highly activated FASLhi T-cell subsets and early-terminated or dysfunctional IL4R+ GATA3+ stem cell-like memory T-cell subset.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The global pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 has resulted in millions of people experiencing long COVID condition, a range of persistent symptoms following the acute phase, with an estimated prevalence of 27%–64%. Materials and Methods To understand its pathophysiology, we conducted a longitudinal study on viral load and cytokine dynamics in individuals with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We used reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR to quantify viral RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and employed multiplex technology to measure plasma cytokine levels in a cohort of people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Our study included individuals with long COVID condition and those without, all of whom had at least three nasopharyngeal and plasma samples collected within 55 days after diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results Individuals affected with long COVID symptoms had delayed viral clearance and lower viral loads at diagnosis compared to those without symptoms. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed variations in IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10 levels, with delayed normalization in individuals affected by long COVID syndrome. Correlation analysis indicated associations between viral load and IP‐10 and interrelations among cytokines IL‐1β, IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10. Conclusion Our study provides insights into the association between nasopharyngeal viral load, cytokine dynamics, and the development of long COVID syndrome, providing an early signature of this condition.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 and other pandemic viruses continue being important for public health and the global economy. Therefore, it is essential to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19 more deeply, particularly its association with inflammatory and antiviral processes. In this study, we used the RNA-seq technique to analyze mRNA and non-coding RNA profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals after SARS-CoV-2 in vitro exposure, to identify pathways related to immune response and the regulatory post-transcriptional mechanisms triggered that can serve as possible complementary therapeutic targets. Our analyses show that SARS-CoV-2 induced a significant regulation in the expression of 790 genes in PBMCs, of which 733 correspond to mRNAs and 57 to non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The immune response, antiviral response, signaling, cell proliferation and metabolism are the main biological processes involved. Among these, the inflammatory response groups the majority of regulated genes with an increase in the expression of chemokines involved in the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and T-cells. Additionally, it was observed that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 induces the expression of genes related to the IL-27 pathway but not of IFN-I or IFN-III, indicating the induction of ISGs through this pathway rather than the IFN genes. Moreover, several lncRNA and RNA binding proteins that can act in the cis-regulation of genes of the IL-27 pathway were identified. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can regulate the expression of multiple genes in PBMCs, mainly related to the inflammatory and antiviral response. Among these, lncRNAs establish an important mechanism in regulating the immune response to the virus. They could contribute to developing severe forms of COVID-19, constituting a possible therapeutic target.">

Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.">

        <tr id="Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new viral variants has challenged public health efforts, often evading antibody responses generated by infections and vaccinations. This immune escape has led to waves of breakthrough infections, raising questions about the efficacy and durability of immune protection. Here we focus on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron spike mutations on ACE-2 receptor binding, protein stability, and immune response evasion. Delta and Omicron variants had 3–5 times higher binding affinities to ACE-2 than the ancestral strain (KDwt = 23.4 nM, KDDelta = 8.08 nM, KDBA.1 = 4.77 nM, KDBA.2 = 4.47 nM). The pattern recognition molecule mannose-binding lectin (MBL) has been shown to recognize the spike protein. Here we found that MBL binding remained largely unchanged across the variants, even after introducing mutations at single glycan sites. Although MBL binding decreased post-vaccination, it increased by 2.6-fold upon IgG depletion, suggesting a compensatory or redundant role in immune recognition. Notably, we identified two glycan sites (N717 and N801) as potentially essential for the structural integrity of the spike protein. We also evaluated the antibody and T cell responses. Neutralization by serum immunoglobulins was predominantly mediated by IgG rather than IgA and was markedly impaired against the Delta (5.8-fold decrease) and Omicron variants BA.1 (17.4-fold) and BA.2 (14.2-fold). T cell responses, initially conserved, waned rapidly within 3 months post-Omicron infection. Our data suggests that immune imprinting may have hindered antibody and T cell responses toward the variants. Overall, despite decreased antibody neutralization, MBL recognition and T cell responses were generally unaffected by the variants. These findings extend our understanding of the complex interplay between viral adaptation and immune response, underscoring the importance of considering MBL interactions, immune imprinting, and viral evolution dynamics in developing new vaccine and treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction. In present, the medical community continues to study the impact of coronavirus infection on various organs and systems of the body. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes multifaceted pathological processes and, among other things, affects the cells of the circulatory system. Objective: To assess the degree of DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Material and methods. 200 patients took part in the study. The control group consisted of conditionally healthy individuals matched by gender and age (n=50). The degree of DNA damage was assessed using the DNA comet assay in an alkaline medium. The assessment parameters included: tail length (TL) (pc), percentage of damaged DNA in the tail (Tail DNA, %), tail moment (conventional units) and Olive moment (conventional units). Results. The average values of the parameters of comet DNA of patients in the acute period of coronavirus infection were: TL 95.18±5.7 pc, percentage of damaged DNA in the tail (Tail DNA%) 70.82±7.12%, tail moment 68.52±8.58 conventional units, Olive moment 41.11±4.46 conventional units. When comparing the parameters of comet DNA of lymphocytes of conditionally healthy individuals and patients in the acute period of coronavirus infection associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a significant increase (p < 0.001) in these parameters is noted, which indicates an increase in the content of fragmented and damaged DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes in sick individuals. Conclusion. The obtained results prove the powerful genotoxic effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on human cells">

        <tr id="In the past decade, a major goal in biomedical research has been to understand why individuals differ in disease susceptibility, disease dynamics, and progression. In many pathologies, this variability stems from evolved immune mechanisms that resist inflammatory stress from various diseases that have been encountered throughout life. These may provide advantages against other diseases, reduce comorbidities, and enhance longevity. This study evaluates prior immunity as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, crucial for understanding plasmatic signaling cascades in different disease stages and their impact on disease progression. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, primarily affects the respiratory system and presents a wide range of symptoms, posing significant challenges to medicine. This study systematically analyzed prior immunity and inflammation in two independent cohorts of infected patients. A serological profile is determined by protein microarrays, which identify IgM and IgG responses against 37 prevalent microbial pathogens and provide a comprehensive plasma analysis of 21 acute-phase proteins. Our results reveal distinct serological profiles correlating with disease severity, indicating that immune system dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is linked to existing immunity. These findings highlight the relevance of prior immunity for monitoring disease progression, particularly in infections and vaccine failure, and underscore the importance of functional proteomics in determining prognostic biomarkers.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly impacted global health, emphasizing the need to understand its pathogenicity and virulence mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the alveolar epithelial barrier and exacerbates airway inflammation, leading to acute respiratory failure, but the molecular details remain unclear. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurological symptoms, potentially due to its weakly understood ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The viral multifunctional Envelope (E) protein is crucial for its virulence, playing a key role in virus assembly, budding, and release. The E protein contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) that interacts with host PDZ domain-containing proteins, potentially affecting host signaling pathways and contributing to pathogenicity. This study focuses on the E protein PBM and its role in virulence, disrupting respiratory epithelial barriers and exacerbating airway inflammation. We generated recombinant mutant viruses lacking the PBM and conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments to elucidate its impact on viral fitness, pathogenicity, and effects on the epithelial integrity. In vitro, the viral mutants showed delayed replication and reduced cytopathic effects. In vivo, experiments with hamsters revealed that PBM-deficient viruses caused less weight loss, lower viral loads, and reduced inflammation, indicating decreased pathogenicity. Histological analyses confirmed less airway damage in these hamsters compared to those infected with the wild-type virus. Additionally, PBM-deficient viruses had impaired interactions with tight junction proteins like ZO-1, a PDZ-containing protein, crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Our findings also demonstrate that the PBM does not play a significant role in neuroinvasion during the acute phase of infection, as evidenced by comparable viral RNA loads across brain regions in infected hamsters, regardless of PBM presence. Histopathological and transcriptomic analyses further support this observation, suggesting that the PBM primarily affects specific epithelial barriers. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis on lung and brainstem from infected hamsters reveals that the PBM modulates inflammatory and immune responses, with a stronger impact in lung tissue than in the brainstem. PBM-deficient viruses induce lower levels of inflammation and cytokine expression, suggesting PBM’s specific role in enhancing viral pathogenicity through the activation of pathways such as NF-κB and TNF. Thus, the E protein PBM plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2’s fitness, virulence, and pathogenicity, through the disruption of cell junctions and inflammation, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to a global health crisis, prompting extensive research into its pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions. One area of increasing interest is the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the complement system, a crucial component of innate immunity. This review explores the intricate relationship between COVID-19 and the complement system, shedding light on how the virus exploits and manipulates the complement components to induce inflammatory responses leading to coagulopathies. The activation of the complement pathway simultaneously activates the coagulation cascade due to the presence of common substrates of mannan-binding serine proteases of the lectin complement system in the coagulation pathway. This cross-talk between the components of the complement and coagulation system further aggravates the dysregulation of immune responses, contributing to the cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 cases. A comprehensive understanding of this crosstalk is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe disease. Understandings into the molecular mechanisms governing this interaction may pave the way for the development of novel antiviral diagnostics and therapies based on immunomodulatory interventions, offering better management for such cases.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is adapting to continuous presence in humans. Transitions to endemic infection patterns are associated with changes in the spike (S) proteins that direct virus-cell entry. These changes generate antigenic drift and thereby allow virus maintenance in the face of prevalent human antiviral antibodies. These changes also fine tune virus-cell entry dynamics in ways that optimize transmission and infection into human cells. Focusing on the latter aspect, we evaluated the effects of several S protein substitutions on virus-cell membrane fusion, an essential final step in enveloped virus-cell entry. Membrane fusion is executed by integral-membrane “S2” domains, yet we found that substitutions in peripheral “S1” domains altered late-stage fusion dynamics, consistent with S1-S2 heterodimers cooperating throughout cell entry. A specific H655Y change in S1 stabilized a fusion-intermediate S protein conformation and thereby delayed membrane fusion. The H655Y change also sensitized viruses to neutralization by S2-targeting fusion-inhibitory peptides and stem-helix antibodies. The antibodies did not interfere with early fusion-activating steps; rather they targeted the latest stages of S2-directed membrane fusion in a novel neutralization mechanism. These findings demonstrate that single amino acid substitutions in the S proteins both reset viral entry—fusion kinetics and increase sensitivity to antibody neutralization. The results exemplify how selective forces driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and antibody evasion operate together to shape SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

The development of antiviral drugs for COVID-19 has been hampered by the requirement of a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory for experiments related to SARS-CoV-2, and by the lack of easy and precise methods for quantification of infection. Here, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 viral vector composed of all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins constitutively expressed in lentivirally transduced cells, combined with an RNA replicon deleted for SARS-CoV-2 structural protein genes S, M and E, and expressing a luciferase-GFP fusion protein. We show that, after concentrating viral stocks by ultracentrifugation, the SARS-CoV-2 viral vector is able to infect two human cell lines expressing receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Both luciferase activity and GFP fluorescence were detected, and transduction was remdesivir-sensitive. We also show that this vector is inhibited by three type I interferons (IFN-I) subtypes. Although improvements are needed to increase infectious titers, this vector system may prove useful for antiviral drug screening and SARS-CoV-2-related investigations.">

        <tr id="Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, major events with immune-modulating effects at population-level included COVID-19 infection, lockdowns, and mass vaccinations campaigns. As immune responses influence many immune-mediated diseases, population scale immunological changes may have broad consequences. Methods We investigated the impact of lockdowns, COVID-19 infection and vaccinations on immune responses in the 2000HIV study including 1895 asymptomatic virally-suppressed people living with HIV recruited between October 2019 and October 2021. Their inflammatory profile was assessed by targeted plasma proteomics, immune responsiveness by cytokine production capacity of circulating immune cells, and epigenetic profile by genome-wide DNA methylation of immune cells. Results Past mild COVID-19 infection had limited long-term immune effects. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccines and especially lockdowns significantly altered both the epigenetic profile in immune cells at DNA methylation level and immune responses. Lockdowns resulted in a strong overall exaggerated immune responsiveness, while COVID-19 vaccines moderately dampened immune responses. Lockdown-associated immune responsiveness alterations were confirmed in 30 healthy volunteers from the 200FG cohort that, like the 2000HIV study, is part of the Human Functional Genomics Project. Discussion Our data suggest that lockdowns have unforeseen immunological effects. Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines have immunological effects beyond anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and studies of their impact on non-COVID-19 immune-mediated pathology are warranted.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes the extremely infectious sickness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Globally, COVID-19 (simply, COVID) has had a terrible impact, killing more than 6 million people. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly around the globe since the first instance of this respiratory viral infection was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on 31 December 2019. Keeping given epidemiological estimates, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Post-COVID is a clinical condition characterized by the development of totally new COVID-19 symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-affected patients have been reporting a range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities which include myocardial inflammation, myocardial infarction, right ventricular dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, coronary artery atherosclerosis, focal myocardial fibrosis, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, viral myocarditis, postural orthostatic tachycardia symptom (POTS), aortic and arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, and arrhythmias. Cardiopulmonary symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, hypotension, and POTS are common and associated with significant disability and heightened anxiety. Additionally, the risk of CV side effects has also been reported with currently available COVID-19 vaccines. Pathophysiological mechanisms for post-COVID cardiac complications are still poorly understood. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiac diseases which are abundant in those at risk of severe disease. This review discusses the definition of post-COVID complications, pathophysiological mechanisms of underlying acute and chronic CV injury, and their impact post-COVID-19 on multiorgan health.

        <tr id="Intra-host diversity is an intricate phenomenon related to immune evasion, antiviral resistance, and evolutionary leaps along transmission chains. SARS-CoV-2 intra-host variation has been well-evidenced from respiratory samples. However, data on systemic dissemination and diversification are relatively scarce and come from immunologically impaired patients. Here, the presence and variability of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed among 71 tissue samples obtained from multiple organs including lung, intestine, heart, kidney, and liver from 15 autopsies with positive swabs and no records of immunocompromise. The virus was detected in most organs in the majority of autopsies. All organs presented intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) with low, moderate, and high abundances. The iSNV abundances observed within different organs indicate that the virus can mutate at one host site and subsequently spread to other parts of the body. In agreement with previous data from respiratory samples, our lung samples presented no more than 10 iSNVs each. But interestingly, when analyzing different organs we were able to detect between 11 and 45 iSNVs per case. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate, and evolve in a compartmentalized manner, in different body sites, which agrees with the "viral reservoir" theory. We elaborate on how compartmentalized evolution in multiple organs may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 evolving so rapidly despite the virus having a proofreading mechanism.">

        <tr id="Introduction Dysregulated host cytokine responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are a primary cause of progression to severe disease, whereas early neutralizing antibody responses are considered protective. However, there are gaps in understanding the early temporal dynamics of these immune responses, and the profile of productive immune responses generated by non-hospitalized people with mild infections in the community. Methods Here we conducted a prospective cohort study of people with suspected infections/exposures in the US state of North Carolina, before vaccine availability. We recruited participants not only in hospitals/clinics, but also in their homes. With serial sampling, we compared virologic and immunologic factors in 258 community cases versus 114 hospital cases of COVID-19 to define factors associated with severity. Results We found that high early neutralizing antibodies were associated with lower nasal viral load, but not protection from hospitalization. Cytokine responses were evaluated in 125 cases, with subsets at first versus second week of illness to assess for time-dependent trajectories. The hospital group demonstrated a higher magnitude of serum IL-6, IL-1R antagonist, IP-10, and MIG; prolonged upregulation of IL-17; and lesser downregulation of GROα, IL-1R antagonist, and MCP1, in comparison to the community group suggesting that these factors may contribute to immunopathology. In the second week of illness, 2-fold increases in IL-6, IL-1R antagonist, and IP-10 were associated with 2.2, 1.8, and 10-fold higher odds of hospitalization respectively, whereas a 2-fold increase in IL-10 was associated with 63% reduction in odds of hospitalization (p<0.05). Moreover, antibody responses at 3-6 months post mild SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community revealed long-lasting antiviral IgM and IgA antibodies as well as a stable set point of neutralizing antibodies that were not waning. Discussion Our data provide valuable temporal cytokine benchmarks to track the progression of immunopathology in COVID-19 patients and guide improvements in immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Genome-wide association studies performed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have uncovered various loci significantly associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity. However, the underlying cis-regulatory genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their impact on clinical phenotypes remain enigmatic. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underscore the importance of expanding the study of regulatory variation to relevant cell types and disease contexts and argue for the existence of extensive gene-environment effects among patients responding to an infection.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 (LC) is a poorly understood, multifactorial condition that persists for at least three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the wide range of associated symptoms—including fatigue, brain fog, and respiratory issues—remain unclear. However, emerging evidence suggests that the reactivation of latent viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus, may significantly contribute to the complexity of LC. These latent viruses can be reactivated by SARS-CoV-2, contributing to a chronic inflammatory state that prolongs symptomatology. This review confirms the potential involvement of latent viral infections in LC and examines whether these infections play an independent role or act synergistically with other factors. In addition, recent studies have highlighted viral persistence and immune dysregulation as key elements in LC. Our findings suggest that preventative strategies, including vaccination and antiviral treatments during the acute phase of COVID-19, show potential in reducing LC risk by preventing viral reactivation. However, tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting these latent infections are urgently needed. Identifying biomarkers of viral reactivation, particularly for high-risk populations, could be considered another effective strategy to mitigate LC severity. Further research is crucial to better understand the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and latent infections, and to improve the prevention and treatment of LC.">

Investigations of the gene expression changes accompanying the infection state provide insight into the molecular and cellular processes depending on the sickness severity and virus variants. Severe Delta COVID-19 has been characterized by the appearance of a monocyte subset enriched for proinflammatory gene expression signatures and a shift in ligand–receptor interactions. We profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of 140,000 nuclei in PBMC samples from healthy individuals or individuals with COVID-19. We investigated cis-regulatory elements and identified the core transcription factors governing gene expression in immune cells during COVID-19 infection. In severe cases, we discovered that regulome and chromatin co-accessibility modules were significantly altered across many cell types. Moreover, cases with the Delta variant were accompanied by a specific monocyte subtype discovered using scATAC-seq data. Our analysis showed that immune cells of individuals with severe Delta COVID-19 underwent significant remodeling of the chromatin accessibility landscape and development of the proinflammatory expression pattern. Using a gene regulatory network modeling approach, we investigated the core transcription factors governing the cell state and identified the most pronounced chromatin changes in CD14+ monocytes from individuals with severe Delta COVID-19. Together, our results provide novel insights into cis-regulatory module organization and its impact on gene activity in immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Viral immunosuppression substantially affects the host immune response of infected patients and the protective efficacy of vaccines. Here, we found that the spike (S) protein, the major vaccine antigen of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), strongly suppresses host innate immunity by inhibiting interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression through both S1 and S2 subunits. Mechanistically, the S protein inhibited the formation of the classic interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 by competing with STAT2 for binding to IRF9, thereby impeding the transcription of ISGs. A strong interaction between S and the STAT1/STAT2 proteins further traps the ISGF3 complex in the endoplasmic reticulum and hinders the nuclear translocation of ISGF3. Notably, the interferon-inhibitory mechanism of the S protein was universal among SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), through the most evolutionarily conserved region of S2 subunit. Taken together, the findings of this study reveal a new mechanism by which the coronavirus S protein attenuates the host antiviral immune response and provides new insights into the proper design of coronavirus S-based vaccines to prevent immunosuppressive effects.


IMPORTANCE
This study unveils a new mechanism by which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein attenuates the host's antiviral immune response. The interferon-inhibitory mechanism of the S protein was universal among SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, through conserved S2 domains. Our study expands the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses in evading antiviral immune strategies, which is very important for the design and optimization of vaccine antigens, thus providing a theoretical basis for human anti-coronavirus immunity and understanding the interaction between the host and coronavirus.">

In this literature review, we want to study these concepts. Mast cells and basophils intervene as a bridge between innate and acquired immunity and seem to have a role in the damage mechanisms during infection and in the stimulation of humoral and cellular immunity. In some cases, these cells can act as reservoirs and favor the replication and spread of the virus in the body.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a profound global impact since its emergence in late 2019. Characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress and death, COVID-19 has necessitated extensive research into the host-pathogen interactions that drive disease progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies. This study employed a multi-omic approach that combined direct RNA sequencing (DRS) and Illumina cDNA sequencing to investigate whole blood transcriptomic profiles in COVID-19 patients. By leveraging the unique capabilities of Nanopore DRS, which provides long-read sequencing data, we were able to capture not only gene expression levels but also crucial RNA modifications, including poly(A) tail length, non-adenine residue (non-A), pseudouridylation (psU), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation. This comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore the impact of these RNA modifications on gene expression and function within the context of COVID-19. Our findings reveal significant alterations in gene expression patterns, poly(A) tail lengths, non-A and the prevalence of psU and m5C modifications in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. These results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between viral infection, host immune response, and RNA processing, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Background. Understanding the interference patterns of respiratory viruses could be important for shedding light on potential strategies to combat these human infectious agents. Objective. To investigate the possible interactions between adenovirus type 2 (AdV2), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A/H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm09) using the A549 cell line. Methods. Single infections, co-infections, and superinfections (at 3 and 24 h after the first virus infection) were performed by varying the multiplicity of infection (MOI). Virus replication kinetics and the mRNA expression of IFN-α, IL-1α and IL-6 were assessed by real-time qPCR. Results. Co-infection experiments showed different growth dynamics, depending on the presence of the specific virus and time. AdV2 replication remained stable or possibly enhanced in the presence of co-infection with each of the two H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses used. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 replication was facilitated by H1N1pdm09 but hindered by AdV2, indicating possible different interactions. Finally, H1N1pdm09 replication exhibited variably effectiveness in the presence of AdV2 and SARS-CoV-2. Superinfection experiments showed that the replication of all viruses was affected by time and MOI. The mRNA expression of IFN-α, IL-1α and IL-6 showed divergent results depending on the virus used and the time of infection. Conclusions. Further investigation of co-infection or superinfection may be helpful in understanding the potential relationship involved in the outcome of viral respiratory infection in the human population.">

        <tr id="Aberrant and sustained activation of microglia is implicated in the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether intrinsic alterations in microglial function impact the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. We conducted transcriptomic and functional analyses of microglia-like cells (iMGLs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MS (pwMS) to answer this question. We generated iPSCs from six pwMS showing increased microglial activity via translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging. We demonstrated that the differentiated iMGL transcriptional profile resembled the microglial signature found in MS lesions. Importantly, compared with healthy controls, MS iMGLs presented cell-autonomous differences in their regulation of inflammation, both in the basal state and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide challenge. Through transcriptomic profiling, we showed that MS iMGLs display increased expression of genes known to be upregulated in MS microglia. Furthermore, upregulated genes in MS iMGLs were associated with immune receptor activation, antigen presentation, and the complement system, with known MS implications. Finally, functional analyses indicated that the transcriptional changes in MS iMGLs corresponded with alterations in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased phagocytosis. Together, our results provide evidence of putative cell-autonomous microglial activation in pwMS and identify transcriptomic and functional changes that recapitulate the phenotypes observed in vivo in microglia from pwMS. These findings indicate that MS disease-specific iPSCs are valuable tools for studying disease-specific microglial activation in vitro and highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets in MS.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a significant threat to global public health. Immunopathological damage plays a role in driving pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure in severe COVID-19. Therefore, dissecting the pulmonary immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to understand disease pathogenesis and identify immune pathways targetable by therapeutic intervention. Considering that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 enhances COVID-19 disease severity, therapeutic targeting of upstream signals that drive type 2 immunity may confer further protection. In this study, we investigate the role of the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis, a potent inducer of type 2 immunity in the lung, in a mouse model of COVID-19. Upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10, ST2-/- mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (69.2% vs 13.3% survival; P = 0.0005), as compared to wild-type mice. In a complementary pharmacologic approach, IL-33/ST2 signaling was inhibited using HpBARI_Hom2, a helminth derived protein that binds to mouse ST2 and blocks IL-33 signaling. In SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (60% vs 10% survival; P = 0.0035), as compared to inert control-treated mice. These data demonstrate that loss of IL-33/ST2 signaling confers protection during acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, implicating the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis as an enhancer of COVID-19 disease severity. The protection conferred by pharmacologic blockade of IL-33/ST2 signaling was independent of viral control, as HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had no reduction in viral titers. This finding suggests an immunopathogenic role for IL-33/ST2 signaling. One potential mechanism through which IL-33/ST2 signaling may drive severe disease is through enhancement of type 2 immune pathways including IL-5 production, as pulmonary IL-5 concentrations were found to depend on IL-33/ST2 signaling in acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Macrophages are innate immune cells that orchestrate the process of inflammation, which varies across time of day. This ensures appropriate biological timing of the immune response with the external environment. The NLRP3 inflammasome mediates IL‐1‐family cytokine release via pyroptosis. Mitochondria play a multifaceted role regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Mitochondria exhibit distinct metabolic changes across time of day, which are influenced by clock genes. However, whether the macrophage clock regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome via mitochondrial control remains unclear. We find heightened mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation from peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) isolated at circadian time (CT) 12 compared to CT 0. In vitro time‐of‐day synchronization of bone‐marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) induced time‐dependent differences in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Myeloid‐specific Bmal1‐deletion enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activity in PECs at CT0 and in unsynchronized BMDMs compared to controls. Pharmacologically disrupting Δψm in synchronized cells reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation to comparable levels, and the same occurred with Bmal1‐deletion. These results further demonstrate circadian clock timing of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is dependent on mitochondrial function and driven through the circadian gene Bmal1.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with the enveloped RNA betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, led to a global pandemic involving over 7 million deaths. Macrophage inflammatory responses impact COVID-19 severity; however, it is unclear whether macrophages are infected by SARS-CoV-2. We sought to identify mechanisms regulating macrophage expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and to determine if macrophages are susceptible to productive infection. We developed a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mouse whereby hACE2 cDNA was cloned into the mouse ACE2 locus under control of the native promoter. We validated susceptibility of hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to wild-type mice and an established K18-hACE2 model of acute fulminating disease. Intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 led to pulmonary consolidations with cellular infiltrate, edema, and hemorrhage, consistent with pneumonia, yet unlike the K18-hACE2 model, hACE2 mice survived and maintained stable weight. Infected hACE2 mice also exhibited a unique plasma chemokine, cytokine, and growth factor inflammatory signature relative to K18-hACE2 mice. Infected hACE2 mice demonstrated evidence of viral replication in infiltrating lung macrophages, and infection of macrophages in vitro revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of altered RNA and ribosomal processing machinery as well as activated cellular antiviral defense. Macrophage IL-1β-driven NF-κB transcription of ACE2 was an important mechanism of dynamic ACE2 upregulation, promoting macrophage susceptibility to infection. Experimental models of COVID-19 that make use of native hACE2 expression will allow for mechanistic insight into factors that can either promote host resilience or increase susceptibility to worsening severity of infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Understanding how RNA viral load changes (viral load kinetics) during acute infection in SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify when and which patients are most infectious. We seek to summarise existing data on the longitudinal RNA viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 sampled from different parts of the respiratory tract (nose, nasopharynx, oropharynx, saliva and exhaled breath) and how this may vary with age, sex, ethnicity, immune status, disease severity, vaccination, treatment and virus variant. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis, using studies identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE (via Ovid). All research studies reporting primary data on longitudinal RNA viral load kinetics of infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 will be included. Methodological quality will be assessed using a validated checklist for longitudinal studies as well as predefined quality criteria for assessment of individual-level RNA viral load. Should the data allow, we will aim to perform individual patient-level meta-analysis. Our primary outcomes are duration to, and quantity of peak RNA viral load, and total duration of viral load shedding within different respiratory compartments. Secondary outcomes include duration of lateral flow antigen and virus culture positivity and variation of RNA viral load by age, immune status, disease severity, vaccination, treatment, lateral flow tests, viral culture positivity and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Study-level effects affecting observations, but not related to properties of the patient, such as the PCR platform and gene target will also be recorded. Random-effects models will estimate the population mean and individual-level variation in viral shedding conditional on the aforementioned variables. Finally, we will summarise the key mechanistic models used in the literature to reconstruct individual-level viral kinetics and estimate how different factors shape viral dynamics over time. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not needed as data will be obtained from published articles or studies with data that have already received and ethical review for analysis.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is central to temporal lobe epilepsy, yet the specific role of myeloid cells remains unclear. In status epilepticus (SE) models, circulating monocytes have been reported to infiltrate the brain, though distinguishing them from microglia remains challenging. Using a rat model, we traced infiltrating monocytes post-SE, to investigate their persistence, phenotypic evolution during epileptogenesis and contribution to neuroinflammation. By tracking phagocyted fluorescent nanoparticles and using CD68 immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that monocytes entered the brain in significant numbers 24 hours post-SE, after the inflammatory peak occurred (7h post-SE). Tracked up to 7 weeks, these cells adopted a microglia-like phenotype, contributed to the microglial scar and sustained low-grade inflammation during the chronic phase of epilepsy solely through their presence, as their expression of pro-inflammatory markers resembled that of non-activated microglia. Importantly, monocytes initially and transiently supported an anti-inflammatory response providing a unique opportunity to modulate neuroinflammation and potentially disrupt epilepsy progression, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Introduction Long COVID is a debilitating condition that lasts for more than three months post-infection by SARS–CoV–2. On average, one in ten individuals infected with SARS CoV- 2 develops Long COVID worldwide. A knowledge gap exists in our understanding of the mechanisms, genetic risk factors, and biomarkers that could be associated with Long COVID. Methods In this pilot study we used RNA-Seq to quantify the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from COVID-recovered individuals, seven with and seven without Long COVID symptoms (age- and sex-matched individuals), on average 6 months after infection. Results Seventy genes were identified as significantly up- or down-regulated in Long COVID samples, and the vast majority were downregulated. The most significantly up- or downregulated genes fell into two main categories, either associated with cell survival or with inflammation. This included genes such as ICOS (FDR p = 0.024) and S1PR1 (FDR p = 0.019) that were both up-regulated, indicating that a pro-inflammatory state is sustained in Long COVID PBMCs compared with COVID recovered PBMCs. Functional enrichment analysis identified that immune-related functions were expectedly predominant among the up- or down-regulated genes. The most frequently downregulated genes in significantly altered functional categories were two leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptors LILRB1 (FDR p = 0.005) and LILRB2 (FDR p = 0.027). PCA analysis demonstrated that LILRB1 and LILRB2 expression discriminated all of the Long COVID samples from COVID recovered samples. Discussion Downregulation of these inhibitory receptors similarly indicates a sustained pro-inflammatory state in Long COVID PBMCs. LILRB1 and LILRB2 should be validated as prospective biomarkers of Long COVID in larger cohorts, over time and against clinically overlapping conditions.">

Data regarding functional roles of human T cells in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) viral clearance in primary COVID-19 are limited. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed samples for associations between SARS2 upper respiratory tract viral RNA levels and early virus-specific adaptive immune responses for 95 unvaccinated clinical trial participants with acute primary COVID-19 aged 18–86 years old, approximately half of whom were considered at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Functionality and magnitude of acute SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated, in addition to antibody responses. Most individuals with acute COVID-19 developed SARS2-specific T cell responses within 6 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Early CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were polyfunctional, and both strongly associated with reduced upper respiratory tract SARS2 viral RNA, independent of neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, these findings provide evidence for protective roles for circulating SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious threat to people worldwide causing a variety of diseases, manifesting with intestinal, respiratory, hepatic, and neurological symptoms. The therapeutic strategy to counteract SARS-CoV-2 encompasses antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, such as systemic glucocorticoids which may benefit patients with middle and severe COVID-19. The spike glycoprotein (S protein), which recognizes the host cell receptor and initiates the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to it, can be considered a potential target for glucocorticoids. However, the mechanism of glucocorticoid inhibitory action against the S protein is currently unclear due to insufficient study of the ligand-binding sites on the S protein. The aim of the study was to evaluate the binding characteristics of systemic glucocorticoids to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and to elucidate the topological features of non-covalent ligand-protein complexes. AutoDock Vina was used for molecular docking studies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with ligands. Dexamethasone (DEX), methylprednisolone (Medrol), triamcinolone (TAC), and prednisone (PRED) were selected as ligands. The Open Babel 3.1.1 software was used to prepare ligand structures. Two 3D structures of the S protein which have open (RBD-up) and closed (RBD-down) conformations in the receptor-binding domain (PDB ID: 6VYB, and PDB ID: 6VXX), respectively, were used as docking targets (www.rcsb.org). Ligand interactions with amino acid residues were identified using the PLIP web tool (https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de). Visualization of docking results was implemented in PyMol 2.5. Docking study demonstrated that all glucocorticoids can bind to multiple sites in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including the receptor-binding fragment (S1) and the fusion fragment (S2). Methylprednisolone showed the best affinity with the S protein in RBD-up conformation than other glucocorticoids, with a binding free energy of –9.7 kcal/mole and an inhibition constant value of 0.08⋅10–6 M. Triamcinolone demonstrated a high affinity with the S protein in RBD-down conformation, at which the binding free energy was −8.8 kcal/mole and an inhibition constant value was 0.36⋅10–6 M. Our results show that Gly744, Asp745 and Arg1000 are mainly involved in the stabilization of complexes through the hydrogen bonds. Hydrophobic interactions are primarily mediated by Thr572, Ile587, and Val976. These results are an important basis for the development of potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and long-term complications in bone health. Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces bone turnover and promotes bone loss, but the mechanism underlying worsened bone health remains elusive. This study sought to identify specific immune mediators that exacerbated preexisting IMIDs after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Plasma samples from 4 groups were analyzed: healthy, IMID only, COVID-19 only, and COVID-19 + IMID. Using high-throughput multiplexed proteomics, we profiled 1,500 protein biomarkers and identified 148 unique biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with IMIDs, including elevated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17F) and bone resorption markers. Long-term circulating SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, a virulence factor for COVID-19, was detected in the COVID + IMID group. RA was one of the most common IMIDs in our study. ORF8 treatment of RA-derived human osteoblasts (RA-hOBs) increased levels of inflammatory (TNF, IL6, CCL2) and bone resorption (RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio) markers compared with healthy controls. Supernatants from ORF8-treated RA-hOBs drove the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast-like cells. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exposure can exacerbate IMIDs through ORF8-driven inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19–induced bone pathologies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Despite the crucial role of aberrant immune responses in ALS pathogenesis, studies investigating immunological profiles in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with ALS have reported inconsistent findings. Herein, we explored the intrathecal adaptive immune response and features of circulating T cells between CSF and blood of patients with ALS using single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. This study comprised a total of 11 patients with apparently sporadic ALS and three controls with non-inflammatory diseases. We collected CSF from all participants, and for three patients with ALS, we additionally obtained paired samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Utilizing droplet-based single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing, we analysed immunological profiles, gene expression characteristics and clonality. Furthermore, we examined T-cell characteristics in both PBMC and CSF samples, evaluating the shared T-cell clones across these compartments. In the CSF, patients with ALS exhibited a lower proportion of CD4+ T cells (45.2 versus 61.2%, P = 0.005) and a higher proportion of CD8+ GZMKhi effector memory T cells (TEMs) than controls (21.7 versus 16.8%, P = 0.060). Higher clonality was observed in CD8+ TEMs in patients with ALS compared with controls. In addition, CSF macrophages of patients with ALS exhibited a significant increase in chemokines recruiting CD8+ TEMs. Immunohistochemical analysis showed slightly higher proportions of T cells in the perivascular and parenchymal spaces in patients with ALS than in controls, and CD8+ TEMs co-localized with neurons or astrocytes in the motor cortices of patients with ALS. Clonally expanded CD8+ GZMKhi TEMs primarily comprised shared T-cell clones between CSF and PBMCs. Moreover, the shared CD8+ TEMs of PBMCs exhibited gene expression profiles similar to CSF T cells. Patients with ALS showed an increase in proportion and clonality of CD8+ GZMKhi TEMs and activated features of macrophages in CSF. The shared T-cell clone between CSF and blood was mainly composed of expanded CD8+ GZMKhi TEMs. In conclusion, single-cell immune profiling provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of ALS, characterized by activated macrophages and clonally expanded CD8+ T cells potentially communicating with the central nervous system and peripheral circulation.">

        <tr id="The complex set of interactions between the immune system and metabolism, known as immunometabolism, has emerged as a critical regulator of disease outcomes in the central nervous system. Numerous studies have linked metabolic disturbances to impaired immune responses in brain aging, neurodegenerative disorders, and brain injury. In this review, we will discuss how disruptions in brain immunometabolism balance contribute to the pathophysiology of brain dysfunction. The first part of the review summarizes the contributions of critical immune cell populations such as microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells in mediating inflammation and metabolism in CNS disorders. The remainder of the review addresses the impact of metabolic changes on immune cell activation and disease progression in brain aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, we also address the therapeutic potential of targeting immunometabolic pathways to reduce neuroinflammation and slow disease progression. By focusing on the interactions among brain immune cells and the metabolic mechanisms they recruit in disease, we present a comprehensive overview of brain immunometabolism in human health and disease.">

        <tr id="Background
Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary, ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia, and other serious complications. Some populations have been observed to be at higher risk for severe disease and death compared to other ethnical groups.


Objective
To evaluate two parameters of the innate immune system, that play a significant role in viral immunity.


Methods
In samples of peripheral blood from sixteen patients with severe COVID-19, ten with asymptomatic to mild illness, and fifteen healthy subjects, the percentage of NK and NKT cells, the expression of different NK cell receptors and the blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were tested.


Results
We observed that patients with severe COVID-19 showed significantly lower frequencies of both CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells compared to patients with mild illness or healthy controls. Furthermore, patients with severe manifestation of COVID-19 exhibited an aberrant expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46. Similarly, NK cells from these patients showed statistically significant differences in the expression of various killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in the two main cell subsets (CD56bright, CD56dim) compared to controls or patients with mild disease. Moreover, patients with severe illness displayed decreased frequency of NKT cells (defined as CD3+CD56+) and elevated blood levels of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.


Conclusion
This study suggests that the abnormal features of NK and NKT cells observed in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may play an important role in the outcome of this infectious disease in various population groups.">

        <tr id="Acute COVID-19 infection causes significant alterations in the innate and adaptive immune systems. While most individuals recover naturally, some develop long COVID (LC) syndrome, marked by persistent or new symptoms weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, there are no clinical tests to distinguish LC patients from those fully recovered. Understanding the immunological basis of LC is essential for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches.We performed deep immunophenotyping and functional assays to examine the immunological profiles of LC patients, individuals with active COVID-19, recovered patients, and healthy donors. This analysis assessed both innate and adaptive immune features, identifying potential biomarkers for LC syndrome. A Binomial Generalized Linear Model (BGLM) was used to pinpoint immune features characterizing LC.COVID-19 patients exhibited depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes, and monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells. Elevated basal inflammation was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to LC patients, whose immune profiles were closer to those of healthy donors and recovered individuals. However, LC patients displayed persistent immune alterations, including reduced T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Tregs) and switched memory B cells, similar to COVID-19 patients. Through BGLM, a unique adaptive immune signature for LC was identified, featuring memory CD8 and gd T cells with low proliferative capacity and diminished expression of activation and homing receptors.The findings highlight a unique immunological signature associated with LC syndrome, characterized by persistent adaptive immune dysregulation. While LC patients displayed recovery in innate immune profiles comparable to healthy and Recovered individuals, deficits in T cell and memory B cell populations were evident, differentiating LC from full recovery. These findings provide insights into LC pathogenesis and may support the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Severe systemic infections can trigger cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms and their impact on the manifestation and progression of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases are poorly understood. The current COVID-19 pandemic has brought a surge of severe viral illness and highlights the importance of understanding the impact of acute infections on cognition and the manifestation of neurodegenerative disease in survivors. A wealth of observational and clinical data suggests major short- and long-term effects of severe infections on cognition, but detailed and systematic analyses of neuropathological changes after acute infections are scarce. In order to bridge this gap and to provide insight into the cellular and molecular effects of severe systemic inflammation on hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, we performed immune profiling on the brains of recovered COVID-19 patients and of patients without a history of severe systemic infection.


METHOD
Immunohistochemical profiling of microglial, astrocytic, and oligodendrocytic morphological biomarkers was performed in human post-mortem tissue sourced from various brain regions. Glial coverage was directly quantified using immunohistochemical analysis software QuPath with custom parameters designed to adapt the program for detecting the different cell types. Multiplexed gene expression analysis of immune and neuroglia-related genes in human post-mortem tissue was performed using the Nanostring nCounter platform.


RESULT
Immunohistochemical profiling of glial cells in COVID-19 patients revealed a subtle but distinct difference in microglial activation, as well as differences in coverage of other glial sub-types, as compared to non-COVID patients, while no significant differences in disease-associated protein pathologies were observed. Multiplexed gene expression analysis corroborated these findings and also revealed significant shifts in oligodendrocyte and myelination-related transcriptomic profiles in COVID patients. A spatial component of COVID-19 was also observed, with a difference in severity of glial population shifts existing between brain regions.


CONCLUSION
These findings demonstrate a subtle, but distinct and long-lasting effect of severe systemic infections on the brain's innate immune system which may impact the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Gene expression analyses of patients suffering from COVID-19 also indicate significant alterations in the transcriptome of oligodendrocytes, and further investigation into the cross-talk between these cells and microglia should be performed.">

        <tr id="Background: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most widespread mosquito-borne virus, which can cause dengue fever with mild symptoms, or progress to fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. As the main target cells of DENV, macrophages are responsible for the innate immune response against the virus. Methods: In this study, we investigated the role of pyroptosis in the pathogenic mechanism of dengue fever by examining the level of pyroptosis in DENV-1-infected macrophages and further screened differentially expressed microRNAs by high-throughput sequencing to predict microRNAs that could affect the pyroptosis of the macrophage. Results: Macrophages infected with DENV-1 were induced with decreased cell viability, decreased release of lactate dehydrogenase and IL-1β, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, cleavage of GSDMD to produce an N-terminal fragment bound to cell membrane, and finally induced macrophage pyroptosis. MicroRNA expression profiles were obtained by sequencing macrophages from all periods of DENV-1 infection and comparing with the negative control. Sixty-three microRNAs differentially expressed in both the early and later stages of infection were also identified. In particular, miR-223-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-146a-5p and miR-34a-5p were recognized as small molecules that may be involved in the regulation of inflammation. Conclusions: In summary, this study aimed to understand the pathogenic mechanism of DENV through relevant molecular mechanisms and provide new targets for dengue-specific therapy.">

        <tr id="Background Several years after the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of trained immunity in COVID-19 remains controversial, and questions regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19 on immune cells remain unresolved. We investigated the roles of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination and latent infections in the progression of COVID-19 and sepsis. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of 97 individuals recovering from mild-to-critical COVID-19 and 64 sepsis patients. Immune cell frequencies, expression of functional markers, and plasma titres of anti-Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies were assessed and their impact on disease severity and outcomes were determined. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS. Results Post COVID-19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterized mainly by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post-critical COVID-19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. Additionally, a higher frequency of CMV and T. gondii seropositive-alongside a lower frequency of BCG seropositive-patients were associated with severe and critical COVID-19. However, the monocyte response to stimulation was unaffected by the severity of COVID-19. Conclusion These findings highlight the long-term alterations of immune cells in post-COVID-19 patients emphasizing the substantial impact of COVID-19 on immune function. However, our data showed no relationship between previous BCG vaccination and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) are critical for neuronal support functions, including myelination and remyelination. Emerging evidence reveals their active roles in neuroinflammation, particularly in conditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study explores the inflammatory translatome of OLCs during the early onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an established MS model. Using RiboTag-based RNA sequencing in genetically modified Olig2-Cre RiboTag mice, we identified 1,556 upregulated and 683 downregulated genes in EAE OLCs. Enrichment analysis indicated heightened immune-related pathways, such as cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and antigen presentation, while downregulated genes were linked to neuronal development and myelination. Notably, OLCs expressed cytokines/chemokines, and their receptor, highlighting their active involvement in neuroinflammatory signaling. Functional studies demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling in OLCs exacerbates EAE pathology by enhancing antigen presentation and chemokine production, whereas interferon-beta (IFN-β) signaling showed minimal impact. These findings provide novel insights into the inflammatory role of OLCs in EAE and suggest therapeutic potential in targeting OLC-mediated neuroinflammation for MS and related disorders.">

The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has raised questions as to the similarities and differences between COVID-19 lung injury and ALI of other etiologies. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of ALI and COVID-19 lung injury and draws comparisons between the latter and other infectious etiologies of ALI. Indeed, severe COVID-19 is characterized by a unique array of disease mechanisms including suppression of interferon responses, widespread inflammasome activation, altered leukocyte phenotypes, and hyperactive thrombotic activity. Moreover, these mechanisms manifest as a unique clinical progression, which further differentiates COVID-19 from other viral respiratory pathogens such as SARS, MERS, and influenza. These unique features of COVID-19 pathophysiology bear important implications for current and future therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants raise concerns about decreased vaccine efficacy, vaccines continue to confer robust protection in humans, implying that immunity beyond neutralization contributes to vaccine efficacy. In addition to neutralization, antibodies can mediate various Fc-dependent effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, the specific role of each Fc-mediated effector function in contributing to COVID-19 disease attenuation in human remains unclear. To fully define the potential immune correlates of Fc-mediated effector functions, we comprehensively analysed the above Fc-mediated effector functions in two study cohorts. In the CoronaVac vaccinee cohort, individuals without breakthrough infection exhibited higher levels of ADCP and ADNP activities with a greater degree of cross-reactivity compared to those who had breakthrough infection. A predictive model was established incorporating ADNP activity and IgG titre, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.837. In the COVID-19 patient cohort, BA.5-specific ADCP and ADNP responses were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients with fatal outcomes compared to milder outcomes. The prognostic model incorporating WT, BA.5, and XBB.1.5 spike-specific ADNP demonstrated effective predictive ability, achieving an AUC of 0.890. Meanwhile, transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients in the acute phases of infection highlighted remarkably upregulation of neutrophil activity and phagocytic function, further reinforcing the essential role of ADNP. Collectively, our findings underscored Fc-mediated effector activities, especially neutrophil phagocytosis, as significant antibody biomarkers for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection and COVID-19 prognosis.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection induces interferon (IFN) response by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we show that the bulk of the IFN-I release comes from pDC sensing of infected cells and not cell-free virions. Physical contact (or conjugates) between pDCs and infected cells is mediated through CD54-CD11a engagement, and such conjugate formation is required for efficient IFN-I production. Interestingly, CD11a is inducible on infected epithelial cells when they are co-cultured with PBMCs, thus allowing for potentially bidirectional cross-talks between CD54 and CD11a, which further amplify the sensing. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) are sensed less efficiently than the Wuhan ancestral strain (LSPQ1), but the mechanisms driving the defect are different among the VOCs. CD11a induction on infected cells is correlated with their ability to form cell conjugates with pDCs. Impaired sensing of the Alpha variant is linked to reduced CD11a induction on infected cells and to fewer conjugates formed with pDCs. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into how SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are sensed by pDCs and reveal that this process is targeted by some VOCs to limit IFN-I production.


IMPORTANCE
Type I interferons (IFN-I) represent an important component of the host's innate defense against initial SARS-CoV-2 infections. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce large quantities of IFN-I upon recognition of viral particles or infected cells. This study shows that pDCs sense infected cells more efficiently than viral particles, leading to a higher production of IFN-I. Physical contact between a pDC and an infected cell is critical to this process; the interaction is mediated via CD11a and ICAM-1 complex and potentially is bidirectional. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have evolved to limit the IFN response through different mechanisms. For the Alpha variant, reduced level of CD11a on infected cells is linked to less contact with pDCs and decreased IFN-I release. Overall, our study characterizes some of the early steps involved in pDC-mediated response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and shows that these processes are targeted by VOCs to likely limit IFN-I response and enhance viral spread.">

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes have been implicated as central mediators of neuroinflammatory processes in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory roles and interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a compartmentalized microfluidic chip coculture platform. This novel platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of fluidically isolated microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 hours. The glial activation and crosstalk were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were successfully generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic chip platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Notably, the levels of secreted inflammatory mediators were altered under coculture conditions, revealing significant glial crosstalk. Utilization of our microfluidic coculture platform facilitated the study of microglial migration and glial activation within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Microglia migrated efficiently toward the astrocyte compartment, and the chemoattractant adenosine diphosphate (ADP) notably increased microglial migration within this platform. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation of the microfluidic chip cocultures successfully recapitulated glial crosstalk, revealing unique responses. This crosstalk was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3 in the cocultures, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate molecular crosstalk between inflammatory microglia and astrocytes, providing evidence of how glial cells orchestrate responses during neuroinflammation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the microfluidic coculture platform developed in this study for microglia and astrocytes provides a more functional and enhanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.">

        <tr id="The long-term effects of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations on adaptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.">

        <tr id="The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection is reported to begin with the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human body through droplets, entering the lungs, and binding to the ACE-2 receptor. Meanwhile, activated macrophages stimulate an immune and inflammatory response, activating the coagulation cascade. This activation in COVID-19 patients can exacerbate the condition and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The coagulation cascade is influenced by the expression of related genes, including F3, F5, F8, F12, F13A1, VWF, THBD, PROC, PROCR, PROS1, SERPINE1, A2M, and PLAUR. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022, with 22 mild COVID-19 cases, 35 moderate-to-severe cases, and 20 healthy control individuals from Dr. M. Djamil Padang General Hospital in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Coagulation gene expression data using the RNA-Seq method with transcriptomic analysis were collected and recorded in transcript per-million (TPM) units. The results showed a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes in moderate-to-severe compared to mild COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The analysis of log2 folds change has a statistically significant increase observed in the expression of coagulation genes and a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes among moderate-to-severe and mild patients, as well as healthy controls. The results underscored the impact of COVID-19 infection on the activity of coagulation cascade genes, which could influence the condition of patients and serve as a reference for therapy.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells play a critical role in supporting antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses. Although these responses often coexist, one can sometimes dominate at the expense of the other. For instance, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a strong cellular immune response but generates a suboptimal neutralizing antibody (nAb) response, hindering viral clearance and enabling persistent infection. Recent findings indicate that this skewed preference toward cellular immunity is determined already during the differentiation of CD4+ T cells. Specifically, subcutaneous (s.c.) LCMV infection predominantly induces T-bet+ T helper 1 (TH1) differentiation while largely neglecting T follicular helper (TFH) differentiation, a key driver of humoral immunity. Here, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for this impaired TFH differentiation. We found that T-bet+ cells induced by s.c. LCMV infection are heterogeneous and encompass a terminally differentiated TH1 subset expressing Granzyme-B (GzmB) and a Tcf-1+ subset that retains the potential for TFH differentiation but that does not express CXCR5 and other mature TFH markers. Interestingly, T cell-derived IFN-γ facilitated the proliferation of the GzmB+ subset and inhibited Tcf-1+ cells’ progression into TFH. The suppression of TFH cells by IFN-γ was not directly mediated through CD4+ T cells but rather involved another cell type, likely dendritic cells. Consistently, inhibition of IFN-γ enabled robust TFH differentiation, formation of germinal centers and increased antibody production. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms inhibiting nAb production in response to viruses and lays a foundation for the development of advanced vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="Invasive breast cancer accounts for 7% of all cancer-related deaths, with the lungs being a common site of metastases. At the same time, lower respiratory tract infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Acute viral respiratory infections induce transitional changes in the lung; however, the impact of these changes on metastasis initiation and cancer progression remains unclear. Using primary murine MMTV-PyMT breast cancer cells in an experimental lung metastasis model, we show that changes induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection impair tumor cell seeding and early establishment in the lung, resulting in lower number of metastatic nodules. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this reduction of metastases is due to alterations in the lung environment mediated by type I interferons (IFNs) that are produced in response to RSV infection. Consistent with that notion, intranasal administration of recombinant IFN-α recapitulates the anti-tumor effect of RSV infection. Type I IFNs change the lung cellular composition and induce an Interferon Stimulated Gene (ISG) driven response, creating an alveolar environment that is less supportive of tumor cell growth. Indeed, epithelial cells from mice infected with RSV or intranasally exposed to IFN-α, are less supportive of tumor cell growth ex vivo. Altogether, our results suggest that type I IFNs induced by infection with some respiratory viruses perturb the lungs and consequently interfere with the ability of tumor cells to successfully initiate metastatic colonization. Significance Women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer have a low survival rate. The lungs are a common metastatic site and are constantly exposed to viral pathogens, such as coronavirus, RSV and influenza virus. Thus, breast cancer and respiratory virus infection are likely to co-occur, but their interplay remains unclear. We show that type I interferons (IFNs), induced upon viral infection impair metastatic cancer cell seeding of mouse lungs. This is potentially via an effect of IFNs on lung epithelial cells, which become less supportive of early tumor cell proliferation. These findings indicate that viral infections and type I IFNs can alter the lung environment and impair implantation of metastatic cells, which could be explored to improve future cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Microglia play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and display remarkable plasticity in their response to inflammatory stimuli. However, the specific signaling profiles that microglia adopt during such challenges remain incompletely understood. Traditional transcriptomic approaches provide valuable insights, but fail to capture dynamic post-translational changes. In this study, we utilized time-resolved single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to measure distinct signaling pathways activated in microglia upon exposure to bacterial and viral mimetics-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the immunomodulatory role of astrocytes on microglial signaling in mixed cultures. Microglia or mixed cultures derived from neonatal mice were treated with LPS or Poly(I:C) for 48 h. Cultures were stained with a panel of 33 metal-conjugated antibodies targeting signaling and identity markers. High-dimensional clustering analysis was used to identify emergent signaling modules. We found that LPS treatment led to more robust early activation of pp38, pERK, pRSK, and pCREB compared to Poly(I:C). Despite these differences, both LPS and Poly(I:C) upregulated the classical reactivity markers CD40 and CD86 at later time points. Strikingly, the presence of astrocytes significantly blunted microglial responses to both stimuli, particularly dampening CD40 upregulation. Our studies demonstrate that single-cell mass cytometry effectively captures the dynamic signaling landscape of microglia under pro-inflammatory conditions. This approach may pave the way for targeted therapeutic investigations of various neuroinflammatory disorders. Moreover, our findings underscore the necessity of considering cellular context, such as astrocyte presence, in interpreting microglial behavior during inflammation.">

While primarily known for respiratory symptoms, it can also affect the ocular surface. This review summarizes the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on ocular surface immunity and inflammation, focusing on infection mechanisms, immune responses, and clinical manifestations. Ocular symptoms, though uncommon, include conjunctivitis, dry eye, and blurred vision. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in ocular surface epithelial cells, facilitating viral entry, replication, and local dissemination. The innate immune responses involving corneal epithelial cells and immune cells are discussed, alongside mechanisms of antigen presentation and adaptive immunity. The review also examines the roles of cytokines and chemokines in mediating ocular surface inflammation and explores the impact of cytokine storms and chronic inflammation on ocular health. Additionally, the interplay between systemic and ocular immune responses is highlighted, analyzing how systemic COVID-19 inflammation influences ocular surface health. These insights underscore the broader implications of COVID-19 beyond localized ocular infection. By consolidating current findings, this review aims to guide preventive and therapeutic strategies while identifying directions for future research to mitigate the ocular consequences of COVID-19.">

However, they are crucial in reducing the risk of severe disease by inducing T-cell memory. T cell receptors (TCRs), which can be obtained from human blood, serve as valuable biomarkers for monitoring T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we investigated the associations between TCR metrics and COVID-19 severity and found significant associations.

        <tr id="Defining consequential differences in intestinal epithelial stem cells in healthy humans versus those with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) is essential for the development of much needed therapies to restore the epithelial barrier and maintain its fidelity. Employing single cell transcriptomic/epigenomic approaches and colonoid models from children and adults with Crohn’s disease led us to identify an inflammatory secretory progenitor (ISP) cell state present almost exclusively in patients with Crohn’s disease compared to control subjects. ISPs exhibit gene expression profiles consistent with normal secretory progenitor cells but concomitantly express a suite of distinguishing pro-inflammatory genes. Mechanistically, ISPs exhibit open chromatin and gene expression of ISP signature genes. While these ISP-specific genes are not expressed in intestinal stem cells, their chromatin is accessible in Crohn’s disease stem cells suggesting that ISP genes are epigenetically poised in stem cells and are transcriptionally activated in ISP cells in the presence of inflammatory stimuli. Consistently, Crohn’s disease colonoids exhibit sustained ISP gene expression that can be elicited further with pro-inflammatory cytokines or via co-culture with pro-inflammatory macrophages. In summary, we define differences in the epithelial stem and progenitor compartment of patients with Crohn’s disease suggesting aberrant stem cell differentiation and inflammatory gene expression arises during disease. HIGHLIGHTS We identify an inflammatory secretory progenitor cell state in endoscopically non-inflamed tissue from pediatric and adult patients with Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s disease epithelial stem and progenitor cells display increased chromatin accessibility preceding the emergence of inflammatory secretory progenitor cell states.

        <tr id="In clinical terms, chronic pain is the most prevalent sequela resulting from COVID-19, which is induced by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), while type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is the most common comorbidity. This triangular relationship can be attributed to the dysfunction of the insulin receptor signaling system (IRSS) in both central and peripheral systems. Patients with T2D are essentially more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the widespread expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in their pancreatic beta cells, which serves as the cellular port for the SARS-CoV-2 to infect and enter the cell. This infection can exacerbate chronic pain and insulin resistance for various reasons. Peripherally, once infected, the virus can cause damage to peripheral nerves and pancreatic β-cells, further exacerbating pain and glucose metabolism conditions. Additionally, in the central nervous system, dysfunctional IRSS is closely linked to chronic pain. Over the past few years of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing body of evidence suggests that insulin and other medications currently used in clinical practice for hyperglycemia control may not be safe for treating these patients. Therefore, we need a proper approach for the treatment of chronic pain in long COVID patients, especially patients with T2D. This review presents evidence that transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) may provide a viable treatment option for chronic pain and metabolic dysfunction by improving the function of IRSS in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT A consistent feature of lung injury is a rapid and sustained accumulation of hyaluronan (HA). The rodent gut‐dwelling nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) induces tissue damage as it migrates through the lungs. Type 2 immune responses are essential for the repair of the lungs, hence Nb infection is a well‐established model to study immune‐mediated lung repair. We found that Nb infection was associated with increased HA in the lung, which peaked at d7 post‐infection (p.i.). Deposition of HA in the alveolar epithelium correlated with regions of damaged tissue and the type 2 immune response, which is characterized by eosinophilia and increased type 2 cytokines such as IL‐13. Consistent with the accumulation of HA, we observed increased expression of the major synthase Has2, alongside decreased expression of Hyal1, Hyal2, and Tmem2, which can degrade existing HA. Expression of Tsg6 was also increased and correlated with the presence of inter‐α‐inhibitor heavy chain–HA complexes (HC·HA) at d7 p.i. Using IL‐13‐deficient mice, we found that the accumulation of HA during Nb infection was IL‐13 dependent. Our data thus provide further evidence that IL‐13 is a modulator of the HA matrix during lung challenge and links IL‐13‐mediated HA regulation to tissue repair pathways.">

        <tr id="Long COVID (LC), manifests in 10-30% of non-hospitalized individuals post-SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to significant morbidity. The predictive role of gut microbiome composition during acute infection in the development of LC is not well understood, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of disease. We conducted a longitudinal study of 799 outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 (380 positive, 419 negative) and found that individuals who later developed LC harbored distinct gut microbiome compositions during acute infection, compared with both SARS-CoV-2–positive individuals who did not develop LC and negative controls with similar symptomatology. However, the temporal changes in gut microbiome composition between the infectious (0–1 month) and post-infectious (1–2 months) phases was not different between study groups. Using machine learning, we showed that microbiome composition alone more accurately predicted LC than clinical variables. Including clinical data only marginally enhanced this prediction, suggesting that microbiome profiles during acute infection may reflect underlying health status and immune responses thus, help predicting individuals at risk for LC. Finally, we identified four LC symptom clusters, with gastrointestinal and fatigue-only groups most strongly linked to gut microbiome alterations.">

        <tr id="By the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had diffused widely across the globe, with 770 million infected individuals and over 7 million deaths reported. In addition to its high infectivity and pathogenicity and its rapid mutation rate, the unique capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to circumvent the immune system has also contributed to the widespread nature of this pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 elicits the onset of innate immune system activation and initiates antiviral responses once it has infected the host. While battling the host’s immune responses, SARS-CoV-2 has established many countermeasures to evade attack and clearance. As the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 continues, substantial evidence has revealed that the 29 proteins synthesized by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are integral to the viral infection process. They not only facilitate viral replication and transmission, but also assist SARS-CoV-2 in escaping the host’s immune defenses, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets that have attracted considerable attention in recent studies. This review summarizes the manner in which SARS-CoV-2 interfaces with the innate immune system, with a particular focus on the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications of mutations.">

        <tr id="Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease, characterized by impaired wound repair, tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Immune system may participate in the development and progression of the disease as indicated by altered activity in IPF sufferers. This study investigates the immune response to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in patients with IPF compared to healthy controls, with a particular focus on evaluation of antibody responses, interferon-gamma release, cytokine profiling and a broad panel of immune cell subpopulations. IPF patients without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 had undetectable levels of anti-N IgG antibodies, highlighting their lack of previous infection. After vaccination, IPF patients showed a significant increase in anti-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies, though their levels were lower compared to healthy controls and convalescent IPF patients. Additionally, IPF patients exhibited altered proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T lymphocytes (Teffs) before and after vaccination. Specifically, IPF patients had higher percentages of Tregs with a Th2 phenotype and Th17 Tregs, along with reduced proportions of Th1/17 Tregs. Teffs in IPF patients showed a decrease in Th1-like and Th2-like populations after vaccination. Moreover, IPF patients demonstrated elevated populations of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc) before vaccination and increased levels of γδ Tc cells throughout the study. Alterations in cytokine profiles were also observed, IPF patients showed higher levels of IL-6 and IL-22 compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest a distinct immune response in IPF patients to the COVID-19 vaccine, characterized by differences in antibody production, T cell differentiation and cytokine secretion compared to healthy individuals.">

        <tr id="Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making them a significant public health concern. During infection, respiratory viruses, including Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), trigger an antiviral immune response, specifically boosting the inflammatory response that plays a critical role in their pathogenesis. The inflammatory response induced by respiratory viruses can be a double-edged sword since it can be initially induced to be antiviral and protective/reparative from virus-induced injuries. Still, it can also be detrimental to host cells and tissues. However, the mechanisms that differentiate the complex crosstalk between favorable host inflammatory responses and harmful inflammatory responses are poorly understood. This review explores the complex interplay between viral pathogens and the host immune response, mainly focusing on the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of VRIs. We discuss how inflammation can both contain and exacerbate the progression of viral infections, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and emerging drugs for modulating the aberrant inflammatory responses during VRIs.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Oligodendrocytes (OL) and their myelin-forming processes are targeted and lost during the disease course of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), targeted by infiltrating leukocytes and their effector cytokines. Myelin repair is considered to be dependent on recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The basis of failure of re-myelination during the disease course of MS remains to be defined. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of pro-inflammatory molecules tumor necrosis factor ⍰ (TNF⍰) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) on the differentiation of human OPCs. Methods We generated human OPCs from induced pluripotent stem cells with a reporter gene under the OL-specific transcription factor SOX10. We treated the cells in vitro with TNF⍰ or IFNγ and evaluated effects in terms of cell viability, expression of OL-lineage markers, and co- expression of astrocyte markers. To relate our findings to the molecular properties of OPCs as found in the MS brain we re-analyzed publicly available single nuclear RNAseq datasets. Results Our analysis indicated that both TNF⍰ and IFNγ decreased the proportion of cells differentiating into the OL-lineage; consistent with previous reports. We now observe the TNF⍰ effect is linked to aberrant OPC differentiation. A subset of O4+, reporter-positive cells co- expressed the astrocytic marker Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). On the transcriptomic level, the cells acquire an astrocyte-like signature alongside a conserved reactive phenotype. Analysis of single- nuclear RNAseq datasets from human MS brain revealed a subset of OPCs expressing an astrocytic signature. Discussion In the context of MS, these results imply that OPCs are present but inhibited from differentiating along the OL-lineage, with a subset acquiring a reactive and stem-cell like phenotype, reducing their capacity to contribute towards repair. These findings help define a potential basis for the impaired myelin repair in MS and provide a prospective route for regenerative treatment.">

        <tr id="CNS-resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells populate the haematoma in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), but the contribution of these cell populations to injury and repair has been controversial. To better characterise myeloid cell changes over time, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a unique paired dataset of live haematoma and peripheral blood samples from 10 ICH patients. This work presents a temporal atlas of ICH myeloid populations and identifies population-specific in-situ transcriptional drivers. In addition to distinct populations of activated microglia and TNF-low microglia, we found a unique and highly activated population of CD14+ monocytes in the haematoma. Perturbation analysis comparing haematoma-associated monocytes to shared populations in blood and haematomas identified TNF signalling as the primary driver of their activation. Employing a custom temporal trajectory analysis based on the embeddings of a single-cell foundation model, we found that this TNF response in monocytes was transient, peaking early after haemorrhage and decreasing over the ensuing 48 hours. Our analysis further identified a transient population of highly activated microglia as the likely source of TNF during the acute stage of ICH. Acute TNF signalling in CD14+ monocytes associated with better adjusted outcomes both in our and external cohorts. Overall, our results suggest that acute TNF signalling between transient populations of activated microglia and unique haematoma-associated monocytes could potentially be beneficial in recovery after ICH.

        <tr id="In multiple sclerosis (MS), microglia and macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in determining the balance among demyelination, neurodegeneration, and myelin repair. Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the lack of therapies aimed at promoting remyelination and slowing disease progression for individuals with MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, shifts the transcriptional programs of microglia and CNS-associated macrophages from a proinflammatory phenotype to a regenerative phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 stimulated scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that prevented the activation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes while also promoting neuroaxonal health and oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment of mice with bryo-1 augmented remyelination after a focal demyelinating injury. Our results demonstrate the potential of bryo-1 and possibly a wider class of PKC modulators as myelin-regenerative and supportive agents in MS and other neurologic diseases.">

 Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe psoriatic subtype characterized by epidermal neutrophil infiltration, often occurring in acute, potentially life-threatening episodes. However, the characterization of the immune microenvironment in GPP lesions compared with plaque psoriasis remains largely unknown. Here, we used single-cell RNA profiling to interrogate the transcriptomes of ∼60 000 single cells from GPP lesional skin (n = 13) and healthy adult skin (n = 4), combined with spatial RNA sequencing. GPP was associated with major shifts in multiple cell populations, including, in particular, increased frequency of myeloid immune cells and supraspinous keratinocytes. We identified a unique myeloid-derived neutrophil subset characterized by the absence of CASP8. CASP8− neutrophils were accompanied by high expression of inflammatory pathway genes, including RIPK1, NF-KB1, IL1B, CXCL1, and CXCL8 in a stable disease state and were found at low levels in an inactive state in healthy skin. Spatial mapping of these genes illustrated the neutrophil transition from pre-inflammation to a pro-inflammation state through casting off CASP8. In silico and in vitro co-culture studies demonstrated that the communication network between IL36G+ spinous KCs and neutrophils is enlarged in the GPP lesions, with TNFSF15 (TL1A) released from neutrophils exaggerating the inflammatory crosstalk. While there was a slight increase in Th17 cells, there was greater prominence of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells highlighted by upregulated GZMB, CCL5, NKG7, and PRF1 expression, hinting at a cytotoxicity tendency rather than inflammation response in GPP lesions. Notably, a subset of S100A9+ fibroblasts in GPP was observed to contribute to the amplification of the GPP immune network through the transition to a pro-inflammatory state, connected by ligand–receptor interactions with other spatially proximate immune cells, including Th17 cells, CD8+ Tc cells, neutrophils, and IL1B+ macrophages. In sum, these data provide an in-depth view of immune cell participation and highlight the role of neutrophil–KC–fibroblast crosstalk in GPP pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of long COVID (LC) still presents many areas of uncertainty. This leads to difficulties in finding an effective specific therapy. We hypothesize that the key to LC pathogenesis lies in the presence of chronic functional damage to the main anti-inflammatory mechanisms of our body: the three reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis, and the mitochondrial redox status. We will illustrate that this neuro-endocrine-metabolic axis is closely interconnected and how the SARS-CoV-2 can damage it at all stages through direct, immune-inflammatory, epigenetic damage mechanisms, as well as through the reactivation of neurotropic viruses. According to our theory, the direct mitochondrial damage carried out by the virus, which replicates within these organelles, and the cellular oxidative imbalance, cannot be countered in patients who develop LC. This is because their anti-inflammatory mechanisms are inconsistent due to reduced vagal tone and direct damage to the endocrine glands of the HPA axis. We will illustrate how acetylcholine (ACh) and cortisol, with its cytoplasmatic and cellular receptors respectively, are fundamental players in the LC process. Both Ach and cortisol play multifaceted and synergistic roles in reducing inflammation. They achieve this by modulating the activity of innate and cell-mediated immunity, attenuating endothelial and platelet activation, and modulating mitochondrial function, which is crucial for cellular energy production and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In our opinion, it is essential to study the sensitivity of the glucocorticoids receptor in people who develop LC and whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause long-term epigenetic variations in its expression and function.">

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous, ranging from cases with mild disease with an almost asymptomatic carrier to severe cases, in which the disease evolves rapidly. A better understanding of monocyte response during SARS-CoV-2 infection would highlight potential biomarkers and establish other possible approaches for severe cases. Methods The study group consisted of 32 COVID-19 patients and 18 health controls from June 2023 to March 2024. The COVID-19 patients were further classified as mild and severe illnesses based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. For flow cytometric analysis, 50 µL of peripheral blood and 1 µL of specific monoclonal antibodies were added to each cytometric tube for surface marker detection. Results Here, the promising finding was that the blood non-classical/classical monocyte (NC/CL) subset was skewed toward NChighCLlow and NClowCLhigh clusters among the severe COVID-19 patients. The NChighCLlow cluster in severe COVID-19 displayed a distinct clinical phenotype, implying a higher 7-day disease progression rate (p = 0.019) and a worse 28-day survival (p = 0.026). Moreover, the secretion of IL-1β and IFN-γ was primarily attributed to CL subset in monocytes, while IL-6 was secreted mainly by NC subset. Conclusion As supported, regarding cytokine profile in context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it was identified that circulating NC cells are proinflammatory cells most related to regulatory cells, while CL subset displayed an effective capacity to virus. These findings have implications toward optimizing evaluation in severe COVID-19, and developing strategies that target altered balance of NC/CL cell subsets.">

Coronaviruses are well-known to have a negative impact on the lungs and cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 induces a cytokine storm that primarily targets the lungs, causing widespread clinical disorders, including COVID-19. Although, SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals often show no or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Novel CoV-2 infection in 2019 resulted in viral pneumonia as well as other complications and extrapulmonary manifestation. ARDS is also linked to a higher risk of death. Now, it is essential to develop our perception of the long term sequelae coronavirus infection for the identification of COVID-19 survivors who are at higher risk of developing the chronic lung fibrosis.

        <tr id="The Flaviviridae are a family of viruses that include the important arthropod-borne human pathogens dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus. Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is essential for virus replication but is also secreted from virus-infected cells. Extracellular NS1 acts as a virulence factor during flavivirus infection in multiple ways, including triggering endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak via interaction with endothelial cells. While the role of NS1 in inducing vascular leak and exacerbating pathogenesis is well appreciated, if and how NS1-triggered endothelial dysfunction promotes virus infection remains obscure. Flaviviruses have a common need to disseminate from circulation into specific tissues where virus-permissive cells reside. Tissue-specific dissemination is associated with disease manifestations of a given flavivirus, but mechanisms dictating virus dissemination are unclear. Here we show that NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction promotes virus dissemination in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models of DENV infection, we show that anti-NS1 antibodies decrease virus dissemination, while the addition of exogenous NS1 promotes virus dissemination. Using an in vitro system, we show that NS1 promotes virus dissemination in two distinct ways: (1) promoting crossing of barriers and (2) increasing infectivity of target cells in a tissue- and virus-specific manner. The capacity of NS1 to modulate infectivity correlates with a physical association between virions and NS1, suggesting a potential NS1-virion interaction. Taken together, our study indicates that flavivirus NS1 promotes virus dissemination across endothelial barriers, providing an evolutionary basis for virus-triggered vascular leak. Author Summary The Flaviviridae contain numerous medically important human pathogens that cause potentially life-threatening infections. Over half of the world’s population is at risk of flavivirus infection, and this number is expected to increase as climate change expands the habitats of the arthropod vectors that transmit these flaviviruses. There are few effective vaccines and no therapeutics approved for prevention or treatment of flavivirus infection, respectively. Given these challenges, understanding how and why flaviviruses cause pathogenesis is critical for identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. The secreted nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of flaviviruses is a conserved virulence factor that triggers endothelial dysfunction in a tissue-specific manner. It is unknown if this endothelial dysfunction provides any benefit for virus infection. Here we provide evidence that NS1-triggered endothelial dysfunction facilitates virus crossing of endothelial barriers and augments infection of target cells in vitro and promotes virus dissemination in vivo. This study provides an evolutionary explanation for flaviviruses evolving the capacity to trigger barrier dysfunction and highlights NS1 and the pathways governing endothelial dysfunction, as therapeutic targets to prevent flavivirus dissemination.">

Although SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been responsible for pneumonia,
recent studies indicate that it also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain, among other vital organs.
Evidence suggests that this virus may travel retrogradely from the olfactory epithelium to brain
stem sections, causing neurological impairments in a significant number of individuals. Individuals
with severe COVID-19 frequently have elevated cytokines that promote inflammation and acute
respiratory failure and require frequent supportive ventilation. These factors are believed to contribute
to cognitive deterioration. Severe neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients include- paralysis,
stroke, cranial nerve deficits, delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, and meningitis. The virus, with
its unique structure, and a high binding affinity for the human enzyme ACE2 (used as an entry point
by the virus), contributes significantly to its deadly nature. Furthermore, to address the outbreak effectively,
researchers worldwide must develop precise treatment strategies. Advancing new diagnostic
and treatment methods to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on cognition requires further
epidemiological research and clinical experience. Additionally, by understanding the virus's
impact on cognitive functions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted treatments to alleviate
these severe neurological consequences.

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) has long been considered an immune-privileged site, where immune responses are tightly regulated to protect neural tissue from inflammation-induced damage. Immune privilege in the CNS is maintained through various mechanisms, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the absence of conventional lymphatic drainage, the specialized function of CNS-resident immune cells, and the expression of immunosuppressive molecules like TGF-β and IL-10. These protective systems are essential for preserving CNS homeostasis, as uncontrolled immune activity in the CNS can lead to irreversible damage to neurons and glial cells. However, immune privilege is not absolute. In neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and Alzheimer’s disease, immune privilege is breached, resulting in the infiltration of immune cells, chronic inflammation, and progressive neural damage. The breakdown of the BBB, immune cell activation, and dysregulated inflammation contribute to the pathophysiology of these diseases. This review examines the mechanisms that underlie immune privilege in the CNS, how these systems are compromised in neuroinflammatory conditions, and the therapeutic implications for modulating immune responses in the CNS. Targeted therapies aimed at restoring immune regulation and preserving CNS function offer promising prospects for treating neuroinflammatory diseases and maintaining CNS health.

        <tr id="The development of new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic potential of microvascular endothelium. A specific feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the post-COVID syndrome that is characterised by long-term impairment of various organs and systems. The immune pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis requires special attention due to their baseline pro-inflammatory status. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of novel coronavirus infection on the risk of chronic systemic hyper-inflammation and low-grade systemic inflammation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Two main groups consisted of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had survived COVID-19 (mild form) 3 months ago, or at earlier terms, including the subjects with post-COVID symptoms and those free of these symptoms. The comparison group included patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without a history of COVID-19. The control group was presented by healthy blood donors. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFá), D-dimers, troponin I, cortisol, and endothelin I (ET-I) were measured in patients’ plasma by immunoassay technique. On the basis of these markers, we calculated integral indices of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) – the levels of reactivity (RL), and chronic systemic hyper-inflammation (ChSI). Low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) was diagnosed in absence of ChSI, but in cases of simultaneous increase of D-dimer levels 250 ng/ml and ET-I levels 90 pg/ml in the patient. 
The most prevalent symptoms of post-COVID in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were tachycardia, arthralgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, which correspond to the population-wide data. By all empirical parameters, the groups of tuberculosis patients were comparable to each other (p 0.05) and significantly differed from control group. However, evaluation of integral indexes is more crucial for assessing the ‘systemic’ origin of the process. Thus, 23-50% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed subcritical SIR (RL = 1-2), being a feature of ChSI in 7.1-13.6% of cases (both in COVID-19 reconvalescents and non-COVID-19 patients). Meanwhile, all patient groups did not show significant difference in the frequency of LGSI and endothelial dysfunction (p 0.05). However, there was a trend towards an increase of these scores in the following sequence: tuberculosis without COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 + post-COVID syndrome. 
Most patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are not characterized by the development of chronic systemic hyperinflammation. LGSI is the most probable feature of general pathology in tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis infection sufficiently contributes to the development of LGSI, since the frequency and severity of LGSI and its individual manifestations are independent on the new coronavirus infection and signs of post-COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="Controlled activation of macrophages to achieve desired phenotypes in vivo and in vitro could lead to possible treatments for several inflammatory and proliferative diseases. This investigation uniquely established that dengue protease enhances the polarization and activation of human and murine macrophages following extracellular exposure. It was observed that macrophages have a robust response to extracellularly administered purified dengue NS2B/NS3 protease; it stimulated the macrophages in classical M1 directions and enhanced both the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). The cells exhibited an increase in the intracellular levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ and an elevation of phosphorylated versions of Akt, P38 MARK, SAPK, and ERK. In tandem, this investigation also established that the heightened responses of stimulated cells were associated with an increase in the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB (P65) protein. The cell viability assay showed that NS2B/NS3 protease exerts no major toxic effect on macrophages after 24 hours of treatment, even at a dosage (20 μg/ml) which was four times higher than the effective dose (5 μg/ml). Remarkably, we also observed that the native form of the viral protease, which drives its enzyme activities, had no bearing on the antigenic qualities of the enzyme. Thus, our study highlighted the efficacy of dengue viral NS2B/NS3 protease as a non-toxic ex vivo macrophage activating/polarizing agent and may serve a vital role in macrophage-based cell therapy in the near future.">

        <tr id="Tumors can exert a far-reaching influence on the body, triggering systemic responses that contribute to debilitating conditions like cancer cachexia. To characterize the mechanisms underlying tumor-host interactions, we utilized a BioID-based proximity labeling method to identify proteins secreted by Ykiact adult Drosophila gut tumors into the bloodstream/hemolymph. Among the major proteins identified are coagulation and immune-responsive factors that contribute to the systemic wasting phenotypes associated with Ykiact tumors. The effect of innate immunity factors is mediated by NFκB transcription factors Relish, dorsal, and Dif, which in turn upregulate the expression of the cachectic factors Pvf1, Impl2, and Upd3. In addition, Ykiact tumors secrete Eiger, a TNF-alpha homolog, which activates the JNK signaling pathway in neighboring non-tumor cells, leading to cell death. The release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from these dying cells presumably amplifies the inflammatory response, exacerbating systemic wasting. Targeting the inflammatory response, the JNK pathway, or the production of cachectic factors could potentially alleviate the debilitating effects of cancer cachexia.">

Compounds from the library that reduced phagocytosis by ≥2 standard deviations across the library without cytotoxicity were validated in secondary screens, with 28 of them further confirmed to reduce phagocytosis by 50% or more. Image-based morphological measurements were calculated to measure the degree of ramified vs. amoeboid morphotype as an indicator of activation state. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling indicated divergent effects on cell signaling, metabolism, activation, and actin dynamics across confirmed compounds. In particular, multiple CNS-penetrant small molecules with prior FDA approval or demonstration of safety in vivo demonstrated modulatory effects on microglia.

        <tr id="Rabies virus (RABV) proteins play dual roles during the infection of complex neural tissue, the generation and spread of new virions and the active inhibition of cellular innate immune pathways, both contributing to rabies’ lethality. While spatially-distinct RABV protein residues specializing in virus-centric and immune-inhibitory functions have been identified, how these dual functions interact to shape infection outcomes across diverse types of host brain cells is unknown. To “unmask” and study how innate immune inhibition affects the transcriptional regulation of the human and viral genome with cellular resolution, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of co-cultured human brain cell types, comparing infection dynamics of a wild-type RABV isolate virus to a mutant virus in which six critical point mutations in the phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M) RABV proteins selectively neuter antagonism of interferon- and NF-κB- dependent cellular responses. Our analysis reveals that RABV gene expression is shaped by host cell type and that wild-type RABV infection induces small-scale, cell-type conserved transcriptional programs that may support infection by hijacking transcriptional feedback systems that control pro-viral host cell factors while minimizing anti-viral responses. In contrast to accepted models, disinhibited innate immune signaling increases RABV transcriptional output across infected cell types. Most strikingly, we discovered a subpopulation of astrocytes that supports an average of 6-fold higher viral mRNA expression through a massive host cell transcriptional change involving ∼38% of astrocyte expressed genes. Our analysis suggests that these astrocytes we term “pro-viral” are a rare subtype present in the human brain and are primed to play a protective role during viral infection in concert with interferon-sensitive microglia recalcitrant to infection.">

        <tr id="Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are genomic fragments integrated into human DNA from germline infections by exogenous retroviruses that threatened primates early in their evolution and are inherited vertically in the germline. So far, HERVs have been studied in the context of extensive immunopathogenic, neuropathogenic and even oncogenic effects within their host. In particular, in our paper, we elaborate on the aspects related to the possible correlation of transposable HERV elements’ activation and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s presence in cells of COVID-19 patients or upon COVID-19 vaccination with implications for natural and adaptive immunity. In particular, the release of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 occurs in such cases and plays a notable role in sustaining chronic inflammation. Moreover, well-known interindividual variations of HERVs might partially account for the interpersonal variability of COVID-19 symptoms or unwanted events post-vaccination. Accordingly, further studies are required to clarify the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s role in triggering HERVs.">

        <tr id="Introduction Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a predominant subset of innate-like T cells in humans, characterized by diverse gene expression profiles and functional capabilities. However, the factors influencing the transcriptomes and effector functions of MAIT cells, particularly at mucosal barriers, remain largely unclear. Methods In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and functional assays to investigate the transcriptomic and functional characteristics of intestinal MAIT cells in mouse models during aging. We also extended scRNA-seq analysis to human intestinal MAIT cells to compare their gene expression patterns with those observed in aged mice. Results Our findings demonstrated that the transcriptomes and functional capabilities of intestinal MAIT cells shifted from MAIT17 to MAIT1 profiles with aging in mouse models, with notable changes in the production of cytotoxic molecules. Further scRNA-seq analysis of human intestinal MAIT cells revealed a segregation into MAIT1 and MAIT17 subsets, displaying gene expression patterns that mirrored those seen in aged mouse models. The transcription factor RORγt was expressed in both MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, acting to repress IFNγ production while promoting IL17 expression. Moreover, reduced expression of RORC and Il17A was correlated with poorer survival outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. Discussion These results suggest that aging induces a functional shift between MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, which may be influenced by transcriptional regulators like RORγt. The observed alterations in MAIT cell activity could potentially impact disease prognosis, particularly in colorectal cancer. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of MAIT cell responses at mucosal barriers, highlighting possible therapeutic targets for modulating MAIT cell functions in aging and disease.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex and multifaceted process that involves dynamic interactions among various cellular and molecular components. This sophisticated interplay supports both environmental adaptability and system resilience in the central nervous system (CNS) but may be disrupted during neuroinflammation. In this article, we first characterize the key players in neuroimmune interactions, including microglia, astrocytes, neurons, immune cells, and essential signaling molecules such as cytokines, neurotransmitters, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and neurotrophic factors. Under homeostatic conditions, these elements promote cellular cooperation and stability, whereas in neuroinflammatory states, they drive adaptive responses that may become pathological if dysregulated. We examine how neuroimmune interactions, mediated through these cellular actors and signaling pathways, create complex networks that regulate CNS functionality and respond to injury or inflammation. To further elucidate these dynamics, we provide insights using a multilayer network (MLN) approach, highlighting the interconnected nature of neuroimmune interactions under both inflammatory and homeostatic conditions. This perspective aims to enhance our understanding of neuroimmune communication and the mechanisms underlying shifts from homeostasis to neuroinflammation. Applying an MLN approach offers a more integrative view of CNS resilience and adaptability, helping to clarify inflammatory processes and identify novel intervention points within the layered landscape of neuroinflammatory responses.">

        <tr id="Unveiling the systemic effects of disease and health requires an holistic approach that has mainly revolved around well established, directly determinable molecular relationships such as the protein synthesis cascade and epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, involving 394 individuals, we found direct linkage of branches spanning human biological functions often not studied in conjunction, using clinical data, gut microbial abundances, blood immune cell repertoires, blood transcriptomic and blood T cell receptor data. Contrary to current paradigms, we demonstrate that immunotypes and enterotypes are orthogonal, likely fulfilling distinct roles in maintaining homeostasis, only bridged via the blood transcriptome. We also identified two distinct inflammatory profiles: the first driven by interferon signalling and the other characterised by non-viral, NF-kB and IL-6 markers. Lastly, we present compelling data showing strong associations of the Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae bacteria with a healthy immunotype and transcriptomic pattern, highlighting their potential role in immune health.

        <tr id="Stroke is a severe neurological disease and a major worldwide issue, mostly manifesting as ischemic stroke (IS). In order to create effective treatments for IS, it is imperative to fully understand the underlying pathologies, as the existing therapeutic choices are inadequate. Recent investigations have shown the complex relationships between several programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, and their correlation with immune responses during IS. However, this relationship is still unclear. To address this gap, this review study explored the cellular interactions in the immune microenvironment of IS. Then, to validate prior findings and uncover biomarkers, the study investigated bioinformatics studies. Several pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK), were involved in PCD-immune interactions. The bioinformatics studies reported key biomarkers such as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), gasdermin D (GSDMD), and TLR4, which have important implications in ferroptosis, cuproptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis respectively. These biomarkers were associated with PCD mechanisms such as oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions. The immune infiltration analysis consistently revealed a significant correlation between PCD pathways and detrimental immune cells, such as neutrophils and γδ T cells. Conversely, M2 macrophages and T helper cells showed protective effects. In conclusion, considering the intricate network of interactions between immune responses and PCD pathways, this study emphasized the necessity of a paradigm shift in therapeutic approaches to address the injuries that are related to this complex network.">

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

This review outlines the hallmark features of immunosenescence, including thymic involution, inflammaging, cellular metabolic adaptations, and hematopoietic changes, and their impact on immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, dendritic cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Thymic involution impairs the immune system’s capacity to react to novel antigens by reducing thymopoiesis and shifting toward memory T cells. Inflammaging, characterized by chronic systemic inflammation, further impairs immune function. Cellular metabolic adaptations and hematopoietic changes alter immune cell function, contributing to a diminished immune response. Developing ways to reduce immunosenescence and enhance immunological function in the elderly population requires an understanding of these mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global pandemic affecting millions of people’s lives, which has led to ‘post-COVID-19 fatigue’. Alarmingly, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only infects the lungs but also influences the heart and brain. Endothelial cell dysfunction and hypercoagulation, which we know occur with this infection, lead to thrombo-inflammation that can manifest as many myriad cardio-cerebrovascular disorders, such as brain fog, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, etc. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with oxidative stress, protein aggregation, cytokine storm, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, the identification of molecular targets involved in these actions could provide strategies for preventing and treating this disease. In particular, the very common enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) has recently been identified as a candidate co-receptor for the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with its involvement in infection. In addition, DPPIV has been reported as a co-receptor for some viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It mediates immunologic reactions and diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension, which have been considered the prime risk factors for stroke among other types of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), DPPIV has been implicated in aggravating the course of infection due to its disruptive effect on inflammatory signaling networks and the neuro–glia–vascular unit. Regarding the neurological, physiological, and molecular grounds governing post-COVID-19 fatigue, this review focuses on DPPIV as one of such reasons that progressively establishes cerebrovascular grievances following SARS-CoV infection.">

        <tr id="Chronic HIV infection drives B-cell dysfunction associated with the accumulation of tissue-like memory (TLMs) and activated memory B cells (MBCs) but decline in resting memory B cells. TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21- CD27- B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-betlow) and TLM2 (T-bethi) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.">

However, understanding these immune heterogeneities and their links to various clinical complications, especially long COVID, remains a challenge. In this study, we performed unsupervised subtyping of longitudinal multi-omics immunophenotyping in over 1,000 hospitalized patients, identifying two critical subtypes linked to mortality or mechanical ventilation with prolonged hospital stay and three severe subtypes associated with timely acute recovery. We confirmed that unresolved systemic inflammation and T-cell dysfunctions were hallmarks of increased severity and further distinguished patients with similar acute respiratory severity by their distinct immune profiles, which correlated with differences in demographic and clinical complications. Notably, one critical subtype (SubF) was uniquely characterized by early excessive inflammation, insufficient anticoagulation, and fatty acid dysregulation, alongside higher incidences of hematologic, cardiac, and renal complications, and an elevated risk of long COVID. Among the severe subtypes, significant differences in viral clearance and early antiviral responses were observed, with one subtype (SubC) showing strong early T-cell cytotoxicity but a poor humoral response, slower viral clearance, and greater risks of chronic organ dysfunction and long COVID. These findings provide crucial insights into the complex and context-dependent nature of COVID-19 immune responses, highlighting the importance of personalized therapeutic strategies to improve both acute and long-term outcomes.">

        <tr id="Parthanatos is distinct from caspase-dependent apoptosis in that it does not necessitate the activation of caspase cascades; Instead, it relies on the translocation of Apoptosis-inducing Factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the nucleus, resulting in nuclear DNA fragmentation. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is an oncolytic virus that selectively targets and kills tumor cells by inducing cell apoptosis. It has been reported that NDV triggers classic apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In this study, we observed that NDV infection induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), which caused a rapid release of endogenous calcium ions (Ca2+). This cascade of events resulted in mitochondrial depolarization, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and structural remodeling of the mitochondria. The overload of Ca2+ also initiated an increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability, facilitating the transfer of AIF to the nucleus to induce apoptosis. Damaged mitochondria produced excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further exacerbated mitochondrial damage and increased mitochondrial membrane permeability, thus promoting additional intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and ultimately triggering an ROS burst. Collectively, these findings indicate that NDV infection promotes excessive calcium accumulation and ROS generation, leading to mitochondrial damage that releases more calcium and ROS, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates AIF-dependent parthanatos. This study not only provides a novel perspective on the oncolytic mechanism of NDV but also highlights new targets for antiviral research.">

        <tr id="Signal transduction downstream of activating stimuli controls CD8+ T cell biology, however these external inputs can become uncoupled from transcriptional regulation in Primary Immune Regulatory Disorders (PIRD). Gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT3 amplify cytokine signaling and cause a severe PIRD characterized by early onset autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, recurrent infections, and immune dysregulation. In both primary human and mouse models of STAT3 GOF, CD8+ T cells have been implicated as pathogenic drivers of autoimmunity. The molecular mechanisms by which STAT3 GOF variants drive this pathology remain unclear. We found that naïve CD8+ T cells have an increased capacity for IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion. Given this dysregulation of CD8+ T cell function, we evaluated changes in immunoregulatory pathways and found evidence of dysregulated purinergic signaling via high dimensional immune profiling, single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional assessment. Specifically, while expression of CD39, which transforms ATP to AMP, was increased on CD8+ T cells from patients with STAT3 GOF, downstream purinergic family members, CD73 and the adenosine receptor, A2AR, were downregulated, impairing the potential to produce or sense inhibitory adenosine. Patients with STAT3 GOF can be clinically treated with JAK inhibitors and this partially normalized naïve CD8+ T cell dysregulation, including aberrant cytokine production. The extent of normalization of cytokine secretion scaled with normalization of CD73 and A2AR. This suggests that a dysregulated purinergic signaling axis plays an important role in CD8+ T cell dysregulation in STAT3 GOF, which may have implications for other inflammatory disorders with amplified STAT signaling. One Sentence Summary Amplified STAT3 signaling in CD8+ T cells from STAT3 GOF patients alters purinergic signaling and dysregulates CD8+ T cell function.">

        <tr id="The mRNA-binding protein KSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) is known to modulate immune cell functions post-transcriptionally, e.g., by reducing the mRNA stability of cytokines. It is known that KSRP binds the AU-rich motifs (ARE) that are often located in the 3′-untranslated part of mRNA species, encoding dynamically regulated proteins as, for example, cytokines. Innate myeloid immune cells, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and macrophages (MACs), eliminate pathogens by multiple mechanisms, including phagocytosis and the secretion of chemo- and cytokines. Here, we investigated the role of KSRP in the phenotype and functions of both innate immune cell types in the mouse model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Here, KSRP−/− mice showed lower levels of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia (AFC) and an increase in the frequencies of PMNs and MACs in the lungs. Our results showed that PMNs and MACs from KSRP−/− mice exhibited an enhanced phagocytic uptake of AFC, accompanied by increased ROS production in PMNs upon stimulation. A comparison of RNA sequencing data revealed that 64 genes related to inflammatory and immune responses were shared between PMNs and MACs. The majority of genes upregulated in PMNs were involved in metabolic processes, cell cycles, and DNA repair. Similarly, KSRP-deficient PMNs displayed reduced levels of apoptosis. In conclusion, our results indicate that KSRP serves as a critical negative regulator of PMN and MAC anti-pathogen activity.">

Sub-optimal levels of neutralizing antibodies in individuals infected with dengue virus are known to be associated with severe disease upon reinfection with a different dengue virus serotype. For Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type-2 infection, three types of ADE have been proposed: (1) Fc receptor-dependent ADE of infection in cells expressing Fc receptors, such as macrophages by anti-spike antibodies, (2) Fc receptor-independent ADE of infection in epithelial cells by anti-spike antibodies, and (3) Fc receptor-dependent ADE of cytokine production in cells expressing Fc receptors, such as macrophages by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. This review focuses on the Fc receptor-dependent ADE of cytokine production induced by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, examining its potential role in severe COVID-19 during reinfection and its contribution to the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, i.e., prolonged symptoms lasting at least three months after the acute phase of the disease. We also discuss the protective effects of recently identified anti-spike antibodies that neutralize Omicron variants.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito‐borne alphavirus that is primarily known for causing severe joint and muscle symptoms, but its pathological effects have extended beyond these tissues. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive proteomic analysis across various organs in rodent and nonhuman primate models to investigate CHIKV's impact on organs beyond joints and muscles and to identify key host factors involved in its pathogenesis. Our findings reveal significant species‐specific similarities and differences in immune responses and metabolic regulation, with proteins like Interferon‐Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) and Retinoic Acid‐Inducible Gene I (RIG‐I) playing crucial roles in the anti‐CHIKV defense. We observed upregulated and downregulated metabolic status in CHIKV‐infected rhesus monkeys and mice, respectively. Additionally, we identified host factors such as S100 Calcium‐Binding Protein A8/A9 (S100A8/A9), Voltage‐Dependent Anion Channel 1/2 (VDAC1/2), Complement Component 3 (C3), Apoptosis‐Inducing Factor Mitochondria‐Associated 1 (AIFM1), Endothelial Cell‐Specific Chemotaxis Regulator (ECSCR), and Kininogen 1 (KNG1) that may contribute to CHIKV‐induced inflammation and hemorrhage. These insights put emphases on the importance of understanding CHIKV's impact on organs beyond joints and muscles, providing potential therapeutic targets and enhancing our understanding of CHIKV pathogenesis. This research underscores the need for appropriate animal models in CHIKV studies and informs the development of targeted therapies to address its systemic effects.">

However, a systems-level elucidation of how signaling networks within distinct cell subpopulations drive cancer progression in vivo has been unattainable due to technical limitations. We developed INSIGHT (INvestigating SIGnaling network of specific cell subpopulation in Heterogeneous Tissue), a new platform technology combining fluorescence-activated cell sorting with ultra-sensitive mass spectrometry to enable phosphoproteomic characterization of rare and discrete cell subpopulations from fixed tissues. We demonstrated the broad utility of INSIGHT by analyzing the oligodendroglial cell-specific signaling network in the mouse brain. We then applied INSIGHT to investigate the rare, disseminated tumor cell subpopulation in glioblastoma patient-derived xenograft models. INSIGHT uncovered a global rewiring of signaling networks with tumor cell dissemination, marked by a transition from proliferation-associated signaling in the primary tumor cells to signaling associated with postsynapse, neuronal migration, and ion homeostasis in disseminated tumor cells. We reveal interconnections between signaling circuitries within the networks, with numerous proteins, including GluA2, exhibiting altered phosphorylation without protein expression changes, emphasizing the role of post-translational modifications in glioblastoma dissemination. We validated key phosphorylation changes and inferred differentially active kinases with tumor spread to offer new systems-level insights into glioblastoma dissemination mechanisms in vivo. INSIGHT is generally applicable to a wide range of biological systems without genetic engineering and provides quantitative phosphorylation and protein expression data for selected cell subpopulations from heterogeneous tissues.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction This review delves into the intricate relationship between NLR inflammasomes, particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the immune‐mediated neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). While the precise etiology of MS remains elusive, compelling research underscores the pivotal role of the immune response in disease progression. Notably, recent investigations highlight the significant involvement of NLRP3 inflammasomes in various autoimmune diseases, prompting an in‐depth exploration of their impact on MS. Method The review focuses on elucidating the activation mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasomes within microglia/macrophages (MG/MФ), examining how this activation promotes an inflammatory response that exacerbates neuronal damage in MS. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature and research findings forms the basis for understanding the intricate interplay between NLRP3 inflammasomes and MS pathogenesis. Results Synthesizing current research, the review provides insight into the pivotal role played by NLR inflammasomes, specifically NLRP3, in MS. Emphasis is placed on the inflammatory response orchestrated by activated MG/MФ, elucidating the cascade that perpetuates neuronal damage in the disease. Conclusions This review concludes by consolidating key findings and offering a nuanced perspective on the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in MS pathogenesis. The detailed exploration of the activation process within MG/MФ provides a foundation for understanding the disease's underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the review sets the stage for potential therapeutic strategies targeting NLRP3 inflammasomes in the pursuit of MS treatment.">

        <tr id="mRNA vaccines have played a crucial role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, but the long-term dynamics of immune responses to repeated vaccination remain poorly understood. In this study, we extend our previous work on first and second dose responses by characterizing the immune signatures elicited by a third dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines using high-resolution temporal profiling of blood transcriptomes collected daily for 9 days post-vaccination. We observed distinct patterns of gene expression related to interferon responses, inflammation, erythroid cell signatures, and plasmablast activity across the three doses. While the first dose elicited a modest response primarily characterized by interferon signaling, the second dose induced a robust, polyfunctional response. The third dose, administered approximately nine months later, maintained this polyfunctional character and matched the second dose in magnitude, though with distinct temporal dynamics. The interferon component peaked on day 2 (similar to the first dose) rather than day 1 (as seen in the second dose), while the erythroid signature showed a markedly different trajectory, with sustained elevation rather than decrease over the following week. Notably, we observed a progressive amplification of the plasmablast response across the three doses, with an earlier peak (day 4) compared to other vaccines, potentially a unique feature of mRNA vaccines. These findings demonstrate that the heightened, polyfunctional responsiveness induced by the second dose is robustly maintained even after a prolonged interval, suggesting effective immune memory. Our results contribute to understanding mRNA vaccine-induced immunity, with implications for optimizing booster strategies and developing next-generation vaccines.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chlamydia genital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease worldwide. A mouse model has been developed in our laboratory to better understand the effect of cold-induced stress on chlamydia genital infection and immune response. However, the stress mechanism affecting the host response to Chlamydia muridarum genital infection remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a role for the beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), which binds noradrenaline and modulates the immune response against chlamydia genital infection in a mouse model. A successful β2-AR homozygous knockout (KO) mouse model was used to study the infection and analyze the immune response. Our data show that stressed mice lacking the β2-AR are less susceptible to C. muridarum genital infection than controls. A correlation was obtained between lower organ load and higher interferon-gamma production by CD4+ and CD8+ cells of the KO mice. Furthermore, exposure of CD4+ T cells to noradrenaline alters the production of cytokines in mice during C. muridarum genital infection. This study suggests that the blockade of β2-AR signaling could be used to increase resistance to chlamydia genital infection. We value the β2-AR KO as a viable model that can provide reproducible results in investigating medical research, including chlamydia genital infection.">

However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which microglia regulate the neuroinflammatory response to spinal cord injury, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing dataset analysis, focusing on changes in microglial subpopulations. We found that the MG1 subpopulation emerged in the acute/subacute phase of spinal cord injury and expressed genes related to cell pyroptosis, sphingomyelin metabolism, and neuroinflammation at high levels. Subsequently, we established a mouse model of contusive injury and performed intrathecal injection of siRNA and molecular inhibitors to validate the role of ceramide synthase 5 in the neuroinflammatory responses and pyroptosis after spinal cord injury. Finally, we established a PC12-BV2 cell co-culture system and found that ceramide synthase 5 and pyroptosis-associated proteins were highly expressed to induce the apoptosis of neuron cells. Inhibiting ceramide synthase 5 expression in a mouse model of spinal cord injury effectively reduced pyroptosis. Furthermore, ceramide synthase 5-induced pyroptosis was dependent on activation of the NLRP3 signaling pathway. Inhibiting ceramide synthase 5 expression in microglia in vivo reduced neuronal apoptosis and promoted recovery of neurological function. Pla2g7 formed a "bridge" between sphingolipid metabolism and ceramide synthase 5-mediated cell death by inhibiting the NLRP3 signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that inhibiting ceramide synthase 5 expression in microglia after spinal cord injury effectively suppressed microglial pyroptosis mediated by NLRP3, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects.">

Despite this, no studies have employed proteomics to characterize host immune responses to severe pediatric vLRTI in both the lower airway and systemic circulation. To address this gap, gain insights into vLRTI pathophysiology, and test a novel diagnostic approach, we assayed 1,305 proteins in tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma from 62 critically ill children using SomaScan. We performed differential expression (DE) and pathway analyses comparing vLRTI (n = 40) to controls with non-infectious acute respiratory failure (n = 22), developed a diagnostic classifier using LASSO regression, and analyzed matched TA and plasma samples. We further investigated the impact of viral load and bacterial coinfection on the proteome. The TA signature of vLRTI was characterized by 200 DE proteins (Padj <0.05) with upregulation of interferons and T cell responses and downregulation of inflammation-modulating proteins including FABP and MIP-5. A nine-protein TA classifier achieved an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-1.00) for identifying vLRTI. In plasma, the host response to vLRTI was more muted with 56 DE proteins. Correlation between TA and plasma was limited, although ISG15 was elevated in both compartments. In bacterial coinfection, we observed increases in the TNF-stimulated protein TSG-6, as well as CRP, and interferon-related proteins. Viral load correlated positively with interferon signaling and negatively with neutrophil-activation pathways. Taken together, our study provides fresh insights into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI and identifies novel protein biomarkers with diagnostic potential.IMPORTANCEWe describe the first proteomic profiling of the lower airway and blood in critically ill children with severe viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI). From tracheal aspirate (TA), we defined a proteomic signature of vLRTI characterized by increased expression of interferon signaling proteins and decreased expression of proteins involved in immune modulation including FABP and MIP-5. Using machine learning, we developed a parsimonious diagnostic classifier that distinguished vLRTI from non-infectious respiratory failure with high accuracy. Comparative analysis of paired TA and plasma specimens demonstrated limited concordance, although the interferon-stimulated protein ISG15 was significantly upregulated with vLRTI in both compartments. We further identified TSG-6 and CRP as airway biomarkers of bacterial-viral coinfection, and viral load analyses demonstrated a positive correlation with interferon-related protein expression and a negative correlation with the expression of neutrophil activation proteins. Taken together, our study provides new insights into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Monocyte‐derived macrophages and microglia initially adopt an anti‐inflammatory phenotype following stroke but later transition to a pro‐inflammatory state. The mechanisms underlying this phenotypic shift remain unclear. This study investigates the activation dynamics of molecular signaling pathways in macrophages and microglia after stroke. Methods We utilized publicly available single‐cell RNA sequencing datasets to examine the activation dynamics of molecular signaling pathways alongside the pro‐inflammatory phenotype of macrophages and microglia. Male C57BL/6 mice underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), with the STING inhibitor H151 administered to tMCAO mice. Neurobehavioral performance was assessed using rotarod, foot fault, novel object recognition, and water maze tests at 5‐, 7‐, 10‐, and 14‐days post‐stroke. Primary microglia and bone marrow‐derived macrophages were cultured for in vitro experiments. Results Single‐cell sequencing data indicated that the activation of STING and subsequent type I interferon signaling drove the phenotypic shift of microglia and macrophages toward a pro‐inflammatory state in the stroke lesion. Immunostaining demonstrated that the emergence of pro‐inflammatory microglia and macrophages aligned with the activation time course of STING and type I interferon signaling. Continuous phagocytosis by macrophages and microglia led to STING activation, which triggered type I interferon signaling and promoted the phenotypic shift. Inhibition of STING signaling prevented this transition, reduced neuroinflammation, and conferred protection against ischemic stroke. Conclusion These findings elucidated the critical role of STING‐mediated type I interferon signaling in driving post‐stroke neuroinflammation and underscored the potential of STING inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for alleviating neuroinflammatory responses following stroke.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) remains the major cause of mortality and morbidity, causing approximately 1.3 million deaths annually. As a highly successful pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has evolved numerous strategies to evade host immune responses, making it essential to understand the interactions between Mtb and host cells. G-protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, contributes to the regulation of pro-inflammatory reactions and the migration of innate immune cells, such as macrophages. Its role in mycobacterial infection, however, has not yet been explored. We found that GPR84 is induced in whole blood samples from tuberculosis patients and Mycobacterium marinum (Mm)-infected macrophage models. Using a Mm-wasabi infection model in mouse tails, we found that GPR84 is an important determinant of the extent of tissue damage. Furthermore, from our studies in an in vitro macrophage Mm infection model, it appears that GPR84 inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and increases intracellular lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, thereby promoting intracellular bacterial survival. Our findings suggest that GPR84 could be a potential therapeutic target for host-directed anti-TB therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical for immunosurveillance yet become dysfunctional in contexts such as chronic stimulation by viral infections or cancer. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less well characterized, which limits therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, which have remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex. Results Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) exert sustained pressure on reservoirs of HIV-infected cells that persist through years of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This selects for latently infected cells, but also potentially for cells that express HIV but possess intrinsic CTL resistance. We demonstrate that such resistance exists in HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells that survive rigorous CTL attack and map CTL susceptibility to cell identities and states defined by single-cell multi-omics and functional metabolic profiling. Cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells were prominently overrepresented amongst survivors, as were cells with quiescent metabolic profiles and low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The induction of ROS production by treatment with deferoxamine sensitized these cells to CTL-mediated elimination. Reservoir-harboring cells from clinical samples share the above transcriptional features, being enriched for quiescent states. Our results provide an atlas for elucidating features of CTL resistance in HIV reservoirs, and identify oxidative stress as a therapeutic target to facilitate reservoir elimination.">

        <tr id="Disease-associated microglia (DAM) are observed in neurodegenerative diseases, demyelinating disorders, and aging. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and evolutionary trajectory of DAM during the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain unclear. Using a mouse model of ALS that expresses a human SOD1 gene mutation, we found that the microglia subtype DAM begins to appear following motor neuron degeneration, primarily in the brain stem and spinal cord. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNAscope in situ hybridization, and flow cytometry, we found that DAM increased in number as the disease progressed, reaching their peak in the late disease stage. DAM responded to disease progression in both SOD1G93A mice and sporadic ALS and C9orf72-mutated patients. Motor neuron loss in SOD1G93A mice exhibited 2 accelerated phases: P90 to P110 (early stage) and P130 to P150 (late stage). Some markers were synchronized with the accelerated phase of motor neuron loss, suggesting that these proteins may be particularly responsive to disease progression. Through pseudotime trajectory analysis, we tracked the dynamic transition of homeostatic microglia into DAM and cluster 6 microglia. Interestingly, we used the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 to deplete microglia in SOD1G93A mice and observed that DAM survival is independent of CSF1R. An in vitro phagocytosis assay directly confirmed that DAM could phagocytose more beads than other microglia subtypes. These findings reveal that the induction of the DAM phenotype is a shared cross-species and cross-subtype characteristic in ALS. Inducing the DAM phenotype and enhancing its function during the early phase of disease progression, or the time window between P130 and P150 where motor neuron loss slows, could serve as a neuroprotective strategy for ALS.">

        <tr id="Background Cytokines and chemokines as crucial participants in innate immune response play significant roles during SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet excessive immune response exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Purpose This study aims to investigate the involvement of which cytokines/chemokines in the cytokine storm of COVID-19, as well as the changes in cytokine/chemokine levels during the course of COVID-19, simultaneously exploring the diagnostic and prognostic value of the relevant cytokines/chemokines for COVID-19. Methods Flow cytometry was employed to detect the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the serum of 50 COVID-19 patients. Results Compared with severe COVID-19 patients, the levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, sCD25, and chemokines IP-10 and MIG in the peripheral blood of non-severe patients were significantly reduced, while only IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10 levels were significantly decreased compared to non-survivors of COVID-19. Meanwhile, serum concentrations of IP-10, MCP-1, sTREM-1, IL-10, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood could distinguish between COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors and were significantly associated with mortality. Among them, the concentration of IP-10 was shown to be the most powerful indicator for predicting adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (AUC: 0.715); however, its combined detection with the conventional inflammatory marker NLR did not improve the predictive value for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, serum IP-10 levels were negatively correlated with peripheral blood NK cell count and total lymphocyte count, while sTREM-1 levels were positively correlated with peripheral blood CD4+ T cell count and CD3+ T cell count. Meanwhile, IL-8 levels were positively correlated with total lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. Finally, the serum levels of cytokines/chemokines in non-survivors of COVID-19 increased significantly before death, while in survivors, they returned to normal levels before discharge. Conclusions Severely ill and non-surviving COVID-19 patients exhibit compromised immune function, with significantly higher levels of inflammation, cytokine/chemokine storms, and immune dysregulation compared to non-severe patients. Serum concentrations of IP-10, MCP-1, sTREM-1, and IL-10 levels can serve as biomarkers to predict adverse outcomes in COVID-19.">

Our study is based on clinical observations that patients with germline gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in CARD11, a known regulator of lymphocyte signaling, frequently develop HLH. Using mouse modeling, we demonstrate that the exclusive dendritic cell (DC)-intrinsic expression of CARD11-GOF alone is surprisingly sufficient to induce an HLH-like syndrome in mice via cell-autonomous proinflammatory MALT1 paracaspase engagement. These findings enhance our understanding of the recurrent HLH development in patients with CARD11-GOF mutations, and uncover an unexpected role of CARD11/MALT1 signaling within the innate immune system in maintaining immune homeostasis.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 posed unprecedented global health challenges of massive proportions. The persistent effects of COVID-19 have become a subject of significant concern amongst the medical and scientific community. This article aims to explore the probability of a link between the COVID-19 infection and the risk of lung cancer development. First, this article reports that SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammatory response and cellular stress, potentially leading to tumorigenesis through common pathways between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer. These pathways include the JAK/STAT3 pathway which is activated after the initiation of cytokine storm following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This pathway is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and immune homeostasis. The JAK/STAT3 pathway is also hyperactivated in lung cancer which serves as a link thereof. It predisposes patients to lung cancer through myriad molecular mechanisms such as DNA damage, genomic instability, and cell cycle dysregulation. Another probable pathway to tumorigenesis is based on the possibility of an oncogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 through hijacking the p53 protein, leading to cell oxidative stress and interfering with the DNA repair mechanisms. Finally, this article highlights the overexpression of the SLC22A18 gene in lung cancer. This gene can be overexpressed by the ZEB1 transcription factor, which was found to be highly expressed during COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="Chronic stress is a major contributor to the development of major depressive disorder, one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Using a model of repeated social defeat stress in mice, we and others have reported that neuroinflammation plays a dynamic role in the development of behavioral deficits consistent with social avoidance and impaired reward responses. Animals susceptible to the model also exhibit hypomyelination in the medial prefrontal cortex, indicative of changes in the differentiation pathway of cells of the oligodendroglial lineage (OLN). We computationally confirmed the presence of immune oligodendrocytes, a population of OLN cells, which express immune markers and myelination deficits. In the current study, we report that microglia are necessary to induce expression of antigen presentation markers (and other immune markers) on oligodendroglia. We further associate the appearance of these markers with changes in the OLN and confirm that microglial changes precede OLN changes. Using co-cultures of microglia and OLN, we show that under inflammatory conditions the processes of phagocytosis and expression of MHCII are linked, suggesting potential priming for antigen presentation by OLN cells. Our findings provide insights into the nature of these OLN cells with immune capabilities, their obligatory interaction with microglia, and identify them as a potential cellular contributor to the pathological manifestations of psychosocial stress.">

        <tr id="The success of the live attenuated Yellow Fever vaccine (YF17D) that elicits immunity lasting over thirty years has made it a widely used model to understand the generation of durable protection. We compare the early single-cell level transcriptional response in mice to YF17D and an adjuvanted-inactivated, but less effective version (InYF). Within the first week, we identify 70 kinetic patterns in 45 cellular clusters, majority of which discriminate between the two formulations, some in a tissue and sex-specific manner. Intriguingly, differential transcripts fall into two categories, one whose association with YF17D or InYF is maintained even when decoupled from their cell-type of expression and the other where such cell-plus-gene pairing is critical to maintain differential marker status. We demonstrate applications of this resource, by identifying B cells with varied interferon and antigen responsiveness in relation to each vaccine.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) promote inflammatory resolution and homeostasis and are thought to have specific reprogramming effects on hman microglia. Decreased SPM levels have been correlated with chronic neuroinflammation, late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuropathology in humans, yet few studies have explored the cellular signatures of resolution. Amyloid is though to bind one target resolution receptor, ChemR23, leading to internalization. In this study we explore if internalized ChemR23 receptor is part of a signaling endosome in microglial cells and how this interfaces with amyloid challenge and/or SPM mitigation.


METHOD
We then challenged human microglial cell culture models (HMC3) with amyloid-beta oligomer activation and/or administered RvE1 to promote resolution. We quantified resolution signaling responses using standard immunoblot. We measured microglial activation using immunofluorescence and cell characterization software. We examined the occurrence of ChemR23 receptor internalization and several endosomal markers by super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy.


RESULT
RvE1 significantly reduces microglial activation and cytokine expression under amyloid challenge. We discovered that RvE1 leads to compensatory response in specific G protein coupled receptors within the resolution family 2) specific signaling events 3) unique endosome signatures, We are quantifying functionality of endosomes and other objectives to share at the poster at AAIC.


CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated that RvE1 modulates inflammation in a mouse model and in a microglial cell line. Understanding the molecular signatures of resolution reprogramming in cells will be key to identifying prognostic indicators and molecular mechanisms of this unique understudied GPCR system and response in the brain.">

        <tr id="Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that alcohol use causes various abnormalities in the immune system and compromises immune functions. However, the mechanistic understanding of ethanol’s effects on the immune system remains limited. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulates multiple processes, including immune responses. Earlier research indicated that type 7 adenylyl cyclase (AC7) regulates the immune system and is highly responsive to ethanol. Therefore, we hypothesized that AC7 is a central player in regulating the effects of alcohol on innate immune responses. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a myeloid lineage-specific AC7 KO mouse model and compared the effects of acute and chronic ethanol treatment on their innate immune responses induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Our results demonstrate that AC7 KO mice had significantly lower survival rates under LPS challenge. Chronic ethanol consumption rescued AC7 KO mice from LPS-induced death. AC7 KO and ethanol, acute and chronic, affected several measurements of cytokine mRNA expressions, including IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10 in the lung and liver. In a few cases, statistical analysis indicated that these two factors interacted, suggesting that AC7 played some role in ethanol’s effect on cytokine expression. Thus, this study demonstrated AC7’s role in ethanol’s effect on the innate immune response.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterised by an overwhelming immune response and high fatality. While most research has focused on its acute phase, many sepsis survivors remain immunologically weakened leaving them susceptible to serious complications from even mild infections. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged immune dysregulation remain unclear, limiting effective interventions. Here, we analysed whether sepsis induced long-term “training” in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), imprinting changes that persist in their myeloid progeny. Peripheral blood analysis of 8 sepsis survivors, 12 patients with septic shock, and 10 healthy donors revealed a significant expansion of CD38+ progenitors in survivors, with increases in megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and reduced mature neutrophil counts. This shift suggests impaired granulopoiesis, favouring immature, immunosuppressive granulocytes. Differentiated macrophages from survivors’ HSPCs exhibited impaired metabolic pathways after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, with downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis genes, indicating altered immune metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed enhanced type-I interferon (IFN) and JAK-STAT signalling in survivors’ macrophages, reflective of potentially tolerance-prone reprogramming. Finally, exposing healthy donor HSPCs to IFNβ during macrophage differentiation reduced HSPC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced a metabolic shift towards glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that sepsis induces lasting reprogramming in HSPCs leading to myeloid progeny with altered immune memory that might drive immune dysregulation in survivors. These data open avenues to explore potential targets to better manage long-term immune alterations in sepsis survivors. KEY POINTS Sepsis induces long-term alterations in HSPCs, leading to the expansion of immature progenitors and metabolic dysregulation of their progeny. Type-I IFN signalling reprograms macrophage differentiation, affecting their metabolic function and reducing cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="Introduction The effects of viral infections might be apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoform-dependent. In humans, there are three major apoE isoforms, E2, E3, and E4. E4 is associated with the enhanced entry of several viruses into the brain and their disease progression. A concern of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the development of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, also known as long COVID. Genetic risk factors for developing long COVID were reported. Methods In this study, we used virus-like particles (VLPs) that include expression of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) structural proteins together with S. In the current study, we used human E2, E3, and E4 targeted replacement mice to assess whether these VLPs affect body weight, behavioral and cognitive performance, and circadian body temperatures. Using VLPs allow working outside an ABSL-3 facility. Results The effects of VLPs on some behavioral measures were apoE isoform-dependent, with the E2 mice being more affected than E3 or E4 mice. The overall decreased activity in the open field containing objects in week 2 indicate that VLPs can also reduce activity levels in an apoE isoform-independent fashion. Discussion The results of the current study indicate that even in the absence of viral replication, detrimental effects of VLPs on behavioral measures and circadian body temperatures are seen.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with a complex and not fully understood etiopathological background involving inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. CHI3L1 has been implicated in pathological conditions such as inflammation, injury, and neurodegeneration, and is likely to play a role in the physiological development of the CNS. CHI3L1 is primarily produced by CNS macrophages, microglia, and activated astrocytes. The CHI3L1 expression pattern in MS lesions might support the important role of astrocytes in modulating inflammatory processes in this disease. The potential applications of CHI3L1 as a biomarker in MS are multifactorial. The measurement of CHI3L1 in body fluids might find its role in the early diagnosis of MS. In further stages, the monitoring of CHI3L1 levels might provide information on disease severity and progression, enabling a better adjustment of therapeutic strategies. Importantly, CHI3L1 might potentially serve as a marker of ongoing glial activation, reflecting the dynamic response of the CNS cells to the inflammatory processes in MS. Although preliminary findings have been promising, further research is needed to validate the utility of CHI3L1 measurements in the diagnosis and prediction of the progression of MS. Additionally, comparisons with other biomarkers might be useful in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The complex aetiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D), characterised by a detrimental cross‐talk between the immune system and insulin‐producing beta cells, has hindered the development of effective disease‐modifying therapies. The discovery that the pharmacological activation of LRH‐1/NR5A2 can reverse hyperglycaemia in mouse models of T1D by attenuating the autoimmune attack coupled to beta cell survival/regeneration prompted us to investigate whether immune tolerisation could be translated to individuals with T1D by LRH‐1/NR5A2 activation and improve islet survival. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from individuals with and without T1D and derived into various immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. Cell subpopulations were then treated or not with BL001, a pharmacological agonist of LRH‐1/NR5A2, and processed for: (1) Cell surface marker profiling, (2) cytokine secretome profiling, (3) autologous T‐cell proliferation, (4) RNAseq and (5) proteomic analysis. BL001‐target gene expression levels were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Mitochondrial function was evaluated through the measurement of oxygen consumption rate using a Seahorse XF analyser. Co‐cultures of PBMCs and iPSCs‐derived islet organoids were performed to assess the impact of BL001 on beta cell viability. Results LRH‐1/NR5A2 activation induced a genetic and immunometabolic reprogramming of T1D immune cells, marked by reduced pro‐inflammatory markers and cytokine secretion, along with enhanced mitohormesis in pro‐inflammatory M1 macrophages and mitochondrial turnover in mature dendritic cells. These changes induced a shift from a pro‐inflammatory to an anti‐inflammatory/tolerogenic state, resulting in the inhibition of CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cell proliferation. BL001 treatment also increased CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+ regulatory T‐cells and Th2 cells within PBMCs while decreasing CD8+ T‐cell proliferation. Additionally, BL001 alleviated PBMC‐induced apoptosis and maintained insulin expression in human iPSC‐derived islet organoids. Conclusion These findings demonstrate the potential of LRH‐1/NR5A2 activation to modulate immune responses and support beta cell viability in T1D, suggesting a new therapeutic approach. Key Points LRH‐1/NR5A2 activation in inflammatory cells of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) reduces pro‐inflammatory cell surface markers and cytokine release. LRH‐1/NR5A2 promotes a mitohormesis‐induced immuno‐resistant phenotype to pro‐inflammatory macrophages. Mature dendritic cells acquire a tolerogenic phenotype via LRH‐1/NR5A2‐stimulated mitochondria turnover. LRH‐1/NR5A2 agonistic activation expands a CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+ T‐cell subpopulation. Pharmacological activation of LRH‐1/NR5A2 improves the survival iPSC‐islets‐like organoids co‐cultured with PBMCs from individuals with T1D.">

        <tr id="Background Acute lung injury (ALI) is a disordered pulmonary disease characterized by acute respiratory insufficiency with tachypnea, cyanosis refractory to oxygen and diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Despite increased research into ALI, current clinical treatments lack effectiveness. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) has shown potential in ALI treatment, and understanding its effects on the pulmonary microenvironment and its underlying mechanisms is imperative. Methods We established a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Bioinformatic analyses of the immune, epithelial and endothelial cells were then performed to explore the dynamic changes of the lung tissue microenvironment. We also analyzed the effects of TMP on the cell subtypes, differential gene expression and potential regulation of transcriptional factors involved. Immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed to identify the effects of TMP on immune inflammatory response. Results We found that TMP efficiently protected against LPS-induced acute lung injury. Results of scRNA-seq showed that the cells were divided into seven major cell clusters, including immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and epithelial cells. Neither dexamethasone (Dex) nor TMP treatment showed any significant protective effects in these clusters. However, TMP treatment in the LPS-induced ALI model significantly increased follicular helper T cells and reduced CD8+ naive T cells, Vcan-positive monocytes and Siva-positive NK cells. In addition, TMP treatment increased the number of basal epithelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), indicating its protective effects on these cell types. Scenic analysis suggested that TMP likely mitigates LPS-induced injury in epithelial and endothelial cells by promoting FOSL1 in basal epithelial cells and JunB in LECs. Conclusions Our findings suggest that TMP appears to alleviate LPS-induced lung injury by regulating the immune response, promoting epithelial cell survival and boosting the antioxidant potential of endothelial cells. This study highlights the potential therapeutic use of TMP in the management of ALI.">

        <tr id="Long COVID is an often-debilitating condition with severe, multisystem symptoms that can persist for weeks or months and increase the risk of various diseases. Currently, there is a lack of diagnostic tools for Long COVID in clinical practice. Therefore, this study utilizes plasma proteomics and metabolomics technologies to understand the molecular profile and pathophysiological mechanisms of Long COVID, providing clinical evidence for the development of potential biomarkers. This study included three age- and gender-matched cohorts: healthy controls (n = 18), COVID-19 recovered patients (n = 17), and Long COVID patients (n = 15). The proteomics results revealed significant differences in proteins between Long COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 recovered patients, with dysregulation mainly focused on pathways such as coagulation, platelets, complement cascade reactions, GPCR cell signal transduction, and substance transport, which can participate in regulating immune responses, inflammation, and tissue vascular repair. Metabolomics results showed that Long COVID patients and COVID-19 recovered patients have similar metabolic disorders, mainly involving dysregulation in lipid metabolites and fatty acid metabolism, such as glycerophospholipids, sphingolipid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism processes. In summary, our study results indicate significant protein dysregulation and metabolic abnormalities in the plasma of Long COVID patients, leading to coagulation dysfunction, impaired energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation, which are more pronounced than in COVID-19 recovered patients.">

        <tr id="The structure and function of the mammalian gut vary by region, yet why inflammatory diseases manifest in specific regions and not others remains unclear. We use a TNF-overexpressing Crohn’s disease (CD) model (TnfΔARE/+), which typically presents in the terminal ileum (TI), to investigate how environmental factors interact with the host’s immune susceptibility to drive region-specific disease. We identified Chlamydia muridarum, an intracellular bacterium and murine counterpart to the human sexually transmitted C. trachomatis, as necessary and sufficient to trigger disease manifestation in the ascending colon (AC), another common site of human CD. Disease manifestation in the AC depends on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) activity induced by hypersensitive surface secretory cells in genetically susceptible hosts. Single-cell and microbial analyses of human specimens also implicates this pathobiont–epithelial IDO1 pathway in patients with a history of CD in the AC. Our findings demonstrate that genetic and microbial factors can independently drive region-specific disease and provide a unique model to study CD specific to the AC.">

        <tr id="Background Neutrophils are key players in innate immunity, forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to defend against infections. However, excess NET formation is implicated in inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and immunothrombosis. Studying NET formation in isolated neutrophils provides important mechanistic insights but does not reflect the complexity of immune interactions in whole blood, limiting our understanding of neutrophil responses. Methods This study investigates chromatin accessibility changes using Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-Seq) during phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced NET formation in whole blood. We compared chromatin accessibility patterns in neutrophils following PMA treatment in isolation and whole blood to assess the impact of other immune cells and signaling environment. Results Whole blood PMA stimulation elicited consistent chromatin accessibility changes across donors, demonstrating organized chromatin decondensation during NET formation. The chromatin response was characterized by increased accessibility in genomic regions enriched for immune-specific pathways, highlighting the role of immune cell interactions in NET formation. Differentially accessible regions (DARs) present following PMA induction in whole blood and isolated neutrophils showed greater association with NET-related and inflammatory transcription factors, while DARs specific to isolated neutrophils showed fewer relevant motifs. Pathway analysis indicated that whole blood responses involved more robust activation of immune-specific pathways, such as interleukin and cytokine signaling, compared to isolated neutrophils. Conclusions Our findings underscore the importance of studying NET formation within a whole blood environment to capture the complexity of neutrophil responses and immune cell interactions. This understanding is crucial for identifying effective therapeutic targets in NET-associated inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex and dynamic response of the central nervous system (CNS) to injury, infection, and disease. While acute neuroinflammation plays a protective role by facilitating pathogen clearance and tissue repair, chronic and dysregulated inflammation contributes significantly to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. This review explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and peripheral immune cells. Key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the NLRP3 inflammasome, are discussed alongside emerging regulators such as non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications, and the gut–brain axis. The therapeutic landscape is evolving, with traditional anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs and corticosteroids offering limited efficacy in chronic conditions. Immunomodulators, gene and RNA-based therapeutics, and stem cell methods have all shown promise for more specific and effective interventions. Additionally, the modulation of metabolic states and gut microbiota has emerged as a novel strategy to regulate neuroinflammation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinically viable therapies. Future studies should concentrate on integrated, interdisciplinary methods to reduce chronic neuroinflammation and slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, providing opportunities for revolutionary advances in CNS therapies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Long COVID (LC) poses a persistent challenge in clinical practice due to limited understanding of its etiology. LC is hypothesized to stem from aberrant immune responses in COVID-19. Vaccinations, which boost immune cells to restore function, could help ease LC symptoms. Methods To exclude the impact of vaccination, we examined the immune cell profiles of recovering COVID-19 patients before vaccines were available. White blood cell differentials were monitored in ninety-twohealthy unvaccinated controls. Seventy-six unvaccinated COVID-19 patients were monitored upon admission and on the 50th day post-symptom onset (DPSO50). Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were analyzed using flow cytometry. Results Mild cases showed no significant changes in lymphocyte counts or subsets from admission to DPSO50. By DPSO50, severe and critical cases showed almost complete recovery from lymphopenia, with critical cases having CD19+ B-cell counts approximately 45% lower than the mild group. Severe and critical cases exhibited reduced B-cell frequencies, with critical cases displaying around 48% higher natural killer (NK) cell counts. In mild cases, NK cell counts negatively correlated with B-cell counts (r=-0.528, p=0.02). Additionally, critical cases showed positive correlations between NK cell counts and CD4+ T-cell counts (r=0.83, p<0.01), and between NK cell counts and CD8+ T-cell counts (r=0.74, p<0.01). Severe cases demonstrated decreased counts of CD4+CD25+CD127lowFoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which positively correlated with B-cell counts (r=0.37, p<0.05). Discussion Our findings indicate that aberrant immune cell profiles in COVID-19 patients change dynamically during recovery, depending on disease severity. This study suggests that convalescent patients from critical COVID-19 may experience long-lasting B-cell lymphopenia.">

        <tr id="Sarcopenia, which diminishes lifespan and healthspan in the elderly, is commonly exacerbated by viral pneumonia, including influenza and COVID-19. In a study of influenza A pneumonia in mice, young mice fully recovered from sarcopenia, while older mice did not. We identified a population of tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages that form a spatial niche with satellite cells and myofibers in young mice but are lost with age. Mice with a gain-of-function mutation in the Mertk receptor maintained this macrophage-myofiber interaction during aging and fully recovered from influenza-induced sarcopenia. In contrast, deletion of Mertk in macrophages or loss of Cx3cr1 disrupted this niche, preventing muscle regeneration. Heterochronic parabiosis did not restore the niche in old mice. These findings suggest that age-related loss of Mertk in muscle tissue-resident macrophages disrupts the cellular signaling necessary for muscle regeneration after viral pneumonia, offering a potential target to mitigate sarcopenia in aging.">

        <tr id="Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons and persistent inflammation. Neurons are terminally differentiated cells, and lost neurons cannot be replaced since neurogenesis is restricted to only two neurogenic niches in the adult brain, whose neurogenic potential decreases with age. In this regard, the astrocytes reprogramming into neurons may represent a promising strategy for restoring the lost neurons and rebuilding neural circuits. To date, many anti-inflammatory agents have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation; however, their potential to restore neuronal loss was poorly investigated. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory effects of lactoferrin on DI-TNC1 astrocyte cell line and its ability to induce astrocyte reprogramming in a context of sustained inflammation. For this purpose, astrocytes were pre-treated with lactoferrin (4 μg/mL) for 24 h, then with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (400 ng/mL), and examined 2, 9 and 16 days from treatment. The results demonstrate that lactoferrin attenuates astrocyte reactivity by reducing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and IL-6 expression, as well as by upregulating Interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokine and NRF2 expression. Moreover, lactoferrin promotes the reprogramming of reactive astrocytes into proliferative neuroblasts by inducing the overexpression of the Sex determining region Y/SRY-box 2 (SOX2) reprogramming transcription factor. Overall, this study highlights the potential effects of lactoferrin to attenuate neuroinflammation and improve neurogenesis, suggesting a future strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.">

        <tr id="Neurological injury drives most deaths and morbidity among patients hospitalized for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Despite its clinical importance, there are no effective pharmacological therapies targeting post-cardiac arrest (CA) neurological injury. Here, we analyzed circulating immune cells from a large cohort of patients with OHCA, finding that lymphopenia independently associated with poor neurological outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells showed that T cells with features of both innate T cells and natural killer (NK) cells were increased in patients with favorable neurological outcomes. We more specifically identified an early increase in circulating diverse NKT (dNKT) cells in a separate cohort of patients with OHCA who had good neurological outcomes. These cells harbored a diverse T cell receptor repertoire but were consistently specific for sulfatide antigen. In mice, we found that sulfatide-specific dNKT cells trafficked to the brain after CA and resuscitation. In the brains of mice lacking NKT cells (Cd1d-/-), we observed increased inflammatory chemokine and cytokine expression and accumulation of macrophages when compared with wild-type mice. Cd1d-/- mice also had increased neuronal injury, neurological dysfunction, and worse mortality after CA. To therapeutically enhance dNKT cell activity, we treated mice with sulfatide lipid after CA, showing that it improved neurological function. Together, these data show that sulfatide-specific dNKT cells are associated with good neurological outcomes after clinical OHCA and are neuroprotective in mice after CA. Strategies to enhance the number or function of dNKT cells may thus represent a treatment approach for CA.">

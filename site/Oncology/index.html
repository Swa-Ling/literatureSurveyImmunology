        <tr id="The emergence of COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presented a global health challenge since its identification in December 2019. With clinical manifestations ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe multi-organ dysfunction, COVID-19 continues to affect populations worldwide. The complex interactions between SARS-CoV-2 variants and the human immune system are crucial for developing effective therapies, vaccines, and preventive measures. Understanding these immune responses highlights the intricate nature of COVID-19 pathogenesis. This retrospective study analyzed, by flow cytometry approach, a cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the initial pandemic waves from 2020 to 2021. It focused on untreated individuals at the time of hospital admission and examined the presence of TR3-56 cells in their immune profiles during the anti-viral immune response. Our findings provide additional insights into the complex immunological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential role of TR3-56 cells as crucial components of the immune response. We suggest that TR3-56 cells could serve as valuable biomarkers for identifying more severe cases of COVID-19, aiding in the assessment and management of the disease.">

        <tr id="Introduction Over the past four years, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious global health challenges. The severe form of disease and death resulted from the failure of immune regulatory mechanisms, closely highlighted by the dual proinflammatory cytokine and soluble immune checkpoint (sICP) storm. Identifying the individual factors impacting on disease severity, evolution and outcome, as well as any additional interconnections, have become of high scientific interest. Methods In this study, we evaluated a novel panel composed of ten sICPs for the predictive values of COVID-19 disease severity, mortality and Delta vs. Omicron variant infections in relation to hyperinflammatory biomarkers. The serum levels of sICPs from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital admission were determined by Luminex, and artificial neural network analysis was applied for defining the distinct patterns of molecular associations with each form of disease: mild, moderate, and severe. Results Notably, distinct sICP profiles characterized various stages of disease and Delta infections: while sCD40 played a central role in all defined diagrams, the differences emerged from the distribution levels of four molecules recently found and relatively less investigated (sCD30, s4-1BB, sTIM-1, sB7-H3), and their associations with various hematological and biochemical inflammatory biomarkers. The artificial neural network analysis revealed the prominent role of serum sTIM-1 and Galectin-9 levels at hospital admission in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors, as well as the role of specific anti-interleukin therapy (Tocilizumab, Anakinra) in improving survival for patients with initially high sTIM-1 levels. Furthermore, strong associations between sCD40 and Galectin-9 with suPAR defined the Omicron variant infections, while the positive match of sCD40 with sTREM-1 serum levels characterized the Delta-infected patients. Conclusions Of importance, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of circulatory immune factors governing the COVID-19 pathology, and identifies key roles of sCD40, sTIM-1, and Galectin-9 in predicting mortality.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory immune response. Monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been observed in monocytes of patients with COVID-19, but the mechanism and consequences of inflammasome activation require further investigation. In this study, we inoculated a macrophage-like THP-1 cell line, primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, and primary monocytes with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages does not rely on viral replication, receptor-mediated entry, or actin-dependent entry. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hNEC cultures without triggering the production of inflammasome cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. Importantly, these cytokines did not inhibit viral replication in hNEC cultures. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of primary monocytes led to inflammasome activation and induced a macrophage phenotype in these cells. Monocytic cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not from peripheral blood, of patients with COVID-19, showed evidence of inflammasome activation, expressed the proinflammatory marker CD11b, and displayed oxidative burst. These findings highlight the central role of activated macrophages, as a result of direct viral sensing, in COVID-19 and support the inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 as potential therapeutic strategies to reduce immunopathology without increasing viral replication.


IMPORTANCE
Inflammasome activation is associated with severe COVID-19. The impact of inflammasome activation on viral replication and mechanistic details of this activation are not clarified. This study advances our understanding of the role of inflammasome activation in macrophages by identifying TLR2, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 as dependent factors in this activation. Further, it highlights that SARS-CoV-2 inflammasome activation is not a feature of nasal epithelial cells but rather activation of bystander macrophages in the airway. Finally, we demonstrate that two pro inflammatory cytokines produced by inflammasome activation, IL-18 and IL-1β, do not restrict viral replication and are potential targets to ameliorate pathological inflammation in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes COVID-19, and so far, it has occurred five noteworthy variants of concern (VOC). SARS-CoV-2 invades cells by contacting its Spike (S) protein to its receptor on the host cell, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the high frequency of mutations in the S protein has limited the effectiveness of existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly the Omicron variant. Therefore, it is critical to develop drugs that have highly effective antiviral activity against both SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in the future. This review provides an overview of the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the current progress on anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.">

 The immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are still under investigation. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild in the pediatric population, some children develop severe clinical manifestations or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after infection. MIS-C, typically emerging 2-6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, is characterized by a hyperinflammatory response affecting multiple organs. This review aims to explore the complex landscape of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, focusing on innate, T cell-, and B cell-mediated immunity, and discusses the role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a superantigen in MIS-C pathophysiology. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving the management and outcomes for affected children.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is linked to high mortality, primarily through an intense inflammatory response. Diacerein has emerged as a potential therapy for COVID-19 due to its potential impact in decreasing the inflammasome activation and coronavirus replication. This study aims to explore diacerein’s influence in inhibiting both viral replication and the inflammatory response after SARS-CoV-2 infection.Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy volunteers and infected in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we carried out a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 14 participants allocated to diacerein (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) therapies every 12 h for 10 days. The primary endpoint was change in plasma markers of inflammasome activation (NLRP3, caspase-1, and gasdermin-D).In vitro protocols have shown that rhein, diacerein’s primary metabolite, decreased IL-1β secretion caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in human PBMCs (p < 0.05), and suppressed viral replication when administered either before or after the virus incubation (p < 0.05). This later effect was, at least partially, attributed to its inhibitory effect on 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro) and papain-like protease in the SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) virus and in the phosphorylation of proteins related cytoskeleton network (p < 0.05). Diacerein-treated COVID-19 patients presented a smaller area under the curve for NLRP3, caspase-1 and GSDM-D measured on days 2, 5, and 10 after hospitalization compared to those receiving a placebo (p < 0.05).The indicated mechanisms of action of diacerein/rhein can reduce viral replication and mitigate the inflammatory response related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings are preliminary and require confirmation in clinical trials.">

This infection model recapitulates breathing-like stretch and culture of epithelial cells at the air–liquid interface and resulted in clinically relevant cytopathic effects including cell rounding of alveolar type 2 cells and disruption of the tight junction protein occludin. Viral replication was confirmed by immunocytochemical nucleocapsid staining in the epithelium and increased shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus within 2 days post-infection, associated with changes in innate host immune responses. Together, these data demonstrate that, under the experimental conditions used in this work, this human alveolus MPS chip can successfully model SARS-CoV-2 infection of human alveolar lung cells.">

Viruses rapidly adapt and evade human immune systems, complicating the development of effective antiviral countermeasures. Consequently, the need for novel antivirals resilient to viral mutations is urgent. In this study, we developed a CRISPR-Cas13b system to target SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, this system was also efficient against SARS-CoV, demonstrating broad-spectrum potential.

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is characterized by its high transmissibility, which has caused a worldwide epidemiological event. Yet, it turns ominous once the disease progression degenerates into severe pneumonia and sepsis, presenting a horrendous lethality. To elucidate the alveolar immune or inflammatory landscapes of Omicron critical-ill patients, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with critical pneumonia caused by Omicron infection, and analyzed the correlation between the clinical severity scores and different immune cell subpopulations. In the BALF of Omicron critical patients, the alveolar violent myeloid inflammatory environment was determined. ISG15+ neutrophils and CXCL10+ macrophages, both expressed the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), were negatively correlated with clinical pulmonary infection score, while septic CST7+ neutrophils and inflammatory VCAN+ macrophages were positively correlated with sequential organ failure assessment. The percentages of ISG15+ neutrophils were associated with more protective alveolar epithelial cells, and may reshape CD4+ T cells to the exhaustive phenotype, thus preventing immune injuries. The CXCL10+ macrophages may promote plasmablast/plasma cell survival and activation as well as the production of specific antibodies. As compared to the previous BALF scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 wild-type/Alpha critical patients, the subsets of neutrophils and macrophages with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features presented obvious distinctions, suggesting an immune disparity in Omicron variants. Overall, this study provides a BALF single-cell atlas of Omicron critical patients, and suggests that alveolar interferon-responsive neutrophils and macrophages may extricate SARS-CoV-2 Omicron critical patients from the nasty fate of sepsis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) preferentially infects the respiratory tract; however, several studies have implicated a multi-organ involvement. Hepatic dysfunctions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been increasingly recognized and described to correlate with disease severity. To elucidate molecular factors that could contribute towards hepatic infection, we concentrated on microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that modulate various cellular processes and which are reported to be differentially regulated during liver injury. We aimed to study the infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) with SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the potential of miRNAs for modulating viral infection.


METHODS
We analysed liver autopsies from a coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-positive cohort for the presence of viral RNA using Nanopore sequencing. PHH were used for the infection with SARS-CoV-2. The candidate miRNAs targeting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were identified using in silico approaches. To discover the potential regulatory mechanism, transfection experiments, qRT-PCRs, western blots and luciferase reporter assays were performed.


RESULTS
We could detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19-positive liver autopsies. We show that PHH express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and can be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulting in robust replication. Transfection of selected miRNA mimics reduced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression and SARS-CoV-2 burden in PHH. In silico and biochemical analyses supported a potential direct binding of miR-141-3p to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.


CONCLUSION
We confirm that PHH are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate selected miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and/or the viral genome reduce viral loads. These data provide novel insights into hepatic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and associated dysfunctions in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has confirmed that the ability to rapidly mutate may be extremely beneficial for a virus. Not long after the first wave, new variants emerged with altered infectivity, disease severity, and mortality. These new strains most notably had numerous mutations of the spike (S) protein, a surface protein responsible for binding to and entering the host cell. The Delta and Omicron strains demonstrated increased immune evasion and improved binding affinity to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This study examines the ability of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 IgG to bind Delta and Omicron antigens, as well as their functional binding capabilities to two different S-ACE2 complexes. Twenty SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from patients who had recovered from infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in the first wave of COVID-19 and 10 pre-pandemic control samples were studied. SARS-CoV-2 exposed patients showed significantly higher levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD (p < 0.001), N protein (p < 0.001), and Omicron spike variant (p = 0.01), but not to Delta spike variant (p = 0.966) when compared with controls. Furthermore, patient samples showed significantly greater inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 binding (p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Conversely, there was no correlation between the binding inhibition of S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 receptor. This study shows there is considerable cross-reactivity of IgG generated by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Delta and Omicron variants.">

Testing of cellular function ex vivo to understand the aberrant immune response in MIS-C is limited. Despite strong Ab production in MIS-C, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing can remain positive for 4-6 wk postinfection. Therefore, we hypothesized that dysfunctional cell-mediated Ab responses downstream of Ab production may be responsible for delayed clearance of viral products in MIS-C. In MIS-C, monocytes were hyperfunctional for phagocytosis and cytokine production, whereas NK cells were hypofunctional for both killing and cytokine production. The decreased NK cell cytotoxicity correlated with an NK exhaustion marker signature and systemic IL-6 levels. Potentially providing a therapeutic option, cellular engagers of CD16 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins were found to rescue NK cell function in vitro. Taken together, our results reveal dysregulation in Ab-mediated cellular responses of myeloid and NK cells that likely contribute to the immune pathology of this disease.">

        <tr id="Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) is a common human neurotropic virus with the majority of adults harboring latent-recurrent infections. In rare cases, HSV-1 infection can access the central nervous system through the neuronal route and develop into life-threatening encephalitis. Here, we used a mouse model for HSV-1 infection to describe the transcriptomic profile of the infected brain stem at the single-cell level and with temporal resolution. Among resident brain cells, microglia increased in proportion during the course of infection, while astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cell levels decrease. At the levels of peripheral immune cells, we found notably monocytes to strongly influx the infected brain. Large dynamic changes were found in the abundance of subpopulations of the different cell types following virus infection. For instance, we identify one subpopulation of microglia exhibiting very high type I interferon and chemokine expression early during infection. This population was also enriched for viral transcripts, suggesting localization at foci of infection, and orchestrating recruitment of other immune cells. In contrast, for the infiltrating monocytes, we identified a larger panel of unique subpopulations with antiviral and inflammatory phenotypes, and found not all of these being highly positive for viral transcripts, thus indicating monocyte activities beyond the infected brain areas. Finally, investigation of endothelial cell cross-talk with other cell types revealed that cytokines derived from microglia and monocyte, but also T cells, contribute to disturbance of the blood brain barrier. Our work thus reveals for the first time the complex nature of the cellular response in the virus-infected brain, which seeks to eliminate infection but can also prime for pathological changes.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infects via the respiratory tract, but COVID-19 includes an array of non-respiratory symptoms, among them gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as vomiting and diarrhea. Here we investigated the GI pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in rhesus macaques and humans. Macaques experienced mild infection with USA-WA1/2020 and shed viral RNA in the respiratory tract and stool, including subgenomic RNA indicative of replication in the GI tract. Intestinal immune cell populations were disturbed, with significantly fewer proliferating (Ki67+) jejunal B cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques than uninfected ones. Modest translocation of bacteria/bacterial antigen was observed across the colonic epithelium, with a corresponding significant increase in plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) that may be induced by LPS. Human plasma demonstrated significant decreases in interleukin (IL)-6 and sCD14 upon recovery from COVID-19, suggesting resolution of inflammation and response to translocated bacteria. sCD14 significantly positively correlated with zonulin, an indicator of gut barrier integrity, and IL-6. These results demonstrate that GI perturbations such as microbial translocation can occur in even mild SARS-CoV-2 infections and may contribute to the COVID-19 inflammatory state.IMPORTANCEThis study investigates gastrointestinal (GI) barrier disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infections and how it may contribute to disease. We observed bacteria or bacterial products crossing from the colon interior (the lumen) to the lamina propria during SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. Bacteria/bacterial products are tolerated in the lumen but may induce immune responses if they translocate to the lamina propria. We also observed a significant increase in soluble CD14, which is associated with an immune response to bacterial products. In addition, we observed that humans recovering from COVID-19 experienced a significant decrease in soluble CD14, as well as the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 and sCD14 correlated significantly across macaque and human samples. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in GI barrier disruption that permits microbial translocation and a corresponding immune response. These findings could aid in developing interventions to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamic features of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binding to the cell membrane and entry cells is crucial for comprehending viral pathogenesis and transmission and facilitating the development of effective drugs against COVID-19. Herein, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to study the binding dynamics between the virus and cell membrane. Our findings revealed that the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs) exhibited a slightly stronger affinity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor compared with the Delta variant and was significantly higher than the wild-type (WT). Using a real-time force-tracing technique, we quantified the dynamic parameters for a single SARS-CoV-2 VLP entry into cells, showing that approximately 200 ms and 60 pN are required. The parameters aligned with the analysis obtained from coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations. Additionally, the Omicron variant invades cells at a higher entry cell speed, smaller force, and higher probability. Furthermore, single-particle fluorescence tracking visually demonstrated clathrin-dependent endocytosis for SARS-CoV-2 entry into A549 cells. The dynamic features of endocytosis provide valuable insights into the SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism and possible intervention strategies targeting the viral infection process.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

This paper reviewed the changes in the number and function of T cells in respiratory viral infections, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2, and summarized related therapeutic explorations. We believe that improving and enhancing the number and function of T lymphocytes in infected hosts is a promising strategy for the treatment of respiratory viral infections, although more systematic and in-depth scientific research is still needed.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever, is an emerging respiratory disease caused by soil dwelling fungi of the Coccidioides genus that is expected to spread from the southwest into the central U.S. by 2050. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the other 40% of patients experience a range of symptoms, from self-limiting pneumonia to life-threatening disseminated disease. The immunological events that underlie the progression to severe disease remain under defined. Here, we probed the early immune response to Coccidioides using a high dose of an attenuated strain of C. posadasii in a mouse model of infection coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing. At 24 hours post-infection, robust immune infiltration is detected in the lung, marked by high levels of inflammatory PD-L1+ neutrophils and fungal-contact dependent pro-fibrotic Spp1+ macrophages. These findings elucidate the early dynamics of the host response to Coccidioides and provide a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the lung. Importance By examining early immune dynamics in the lungs, we uncover critical insights into how myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, are recruited and differentiated during Coccidioides infection. The discovery of specific immune cell subsets, such as PD-L1+ neutrophils and Spp1+ macrophages, which are associated with inflammation and fibrosis, highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interactions that occur during Coccidioides infection, offering valuable directions for developing more effective treatments and preventive strategies against this increasingly prevalent disease.">

        <tr id="Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading worldwide with devastating immediate or long-term effects on people’s health. Although the lungs are the primary organ affected by COVID-19, individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 also develop systemic lesions involving multiple organs throughout the body, such as the cardiovascular system. Emerging evidence reveals that COVID-19 could generate myocardial fibrosis, termed “COVID-19-associated myocardial fibrosis.” It can result from the activation of fibroblasts via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), microRNAs, and other pathways, and can also occur in other cellular interactions with SARS-CoV-2, such as immunocytes, endothelial cells. Nonetheless, to gain a more profound insight into the natural progression of COVID-19-related myocardial fibrosis, additional investigations are necessary. This review delves into the underlying mechanisms contributing to COVID-19-associated myocardial fibrosis while also examining the antifibrotic potential of current COVID-19 treatments, thereby offering guidance for future clinical trials of these medications. Ultimately, we propose future research directions for COVID-19-associated myocardial fibrosis in the post-COVID-19 era, such as artificial intelligence (AI) telemedicine. We also recommend that relevant tests be added to the follow-up of COVID-19 patients to detect myocardial fibrosis promptly.">

This has elicited an immediate need for accelerated research into its mechanisms of disease, criteria for diagnosis, methods for forecasting outcomes, and treatment approaches. microRNAs (miRNAs), are diminutive RNA molecules, that are non-coding and participate in gene expression regulation post-transcriptionally, having an important participation in regulating immune processes. miRNAs have granted substantial interest in their impact on viral replication, cell proliferation, and modulation of how the host’s immune system responds. This narrative review delves into host miRNAs’ multifaceted roles within the COVID-19 context, highlighting their involvement in disease progression, diagnostics, and prognostics aspects, given their stability in biological fluids and varied expression profiles when responding to an infection. Additionally, we discuss complicated interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and host cellular machinery facilitated by host miRNAs revealing how dysregulation of host miRNA expression profiles advances viral replication, immune evasion, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, it investigates the potential of host miRNAs as therapeutic agents, whether synthetic or naturally occurring, which could be harnessed to either mitigate harmful inflammation or enhance antiviral responses. However, searching more deeply is needed to clarify how host’s miRNAs are involved in pathogenesis of COVID-19, its diagnosis processes, prognostic assessments, and treatment approaches for patients.">

At the same time, our knowledge about this virus is still incipient. In some cases, there is a pre-pandemic immunity, however its source is unknown. The analysis of patients' humoral responses might shed a light on this puzzle. In this paper, we evaluated the antibody recognition of nucleocapsid protein, one of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we used pre-pandemic, acute COVID-19 and convalescent patients' sera to identify and map nucleocapsid protein epitopes. We identified a common epitope KKSAAEASKKPRQKRTATKA recognized by sera antibodies from all three groups. Some motifs of this sequence are widespread among various coronaviruses, plant or human proteins indicating that there might be more sources of nucleocapsid-reactive antibodies than previous infection with seasonal coronavirus. The two sequences MSDNGPQNQRNAPRITFGGP and KADETQALPQRQKKQQTVTL were detected as specific for sera from patients in acute phase of infection and convalescents making them suitable for future development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a crucial role in regulation of immune response. It is believed that excessive activity of Treg cells in the early stages of infectious diseases reduces the pro-inflammatory activity of cells in the innate and adaptive immune response, thereby contributing to the development of chronic inflammation or excessive inflammation. Additionally, it is known that aging leads to changes in the quantity of Treg cells and disrupts their activity. It is established that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to fatal and severe cases of the disease, primarily among the elderly population. However, the underlying cause of the development of severe forms in elderly individuals remains incompletely understood. Thus, we hypothesized that the dysregulation of the Treg cell activity in elderly individuals may contribute to the development of severe forms and lethality from SARS-CoV-2, leading to the emergence of hyper inflammation in this population. 
To investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the immunosuppressive properties of Treg cells, venous blood samples were obtained from young healthy volunteers and elderly individuals. Dendritic cells were obtained by PBMC adhesion on plastic. Adherent monocytes were cultured in cytokine medium with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-SCF), with addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after 48 hours and incubated for an additional 24 hours with S1 or N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The obtained dendritic cells presenting SARS-CoV-2 antigens were then co-cultured with autologous CD4+-T lymphocytes ex vivo. The expression level of immunosuppressive membrane-associated and soluble molecules expressed by Treg cells was assessed using flow cytometry. 
Our results indicate that the immunosuppressive activity of Treg cells exhibits contrasting patterns in the two donor groups studied in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The proportion of Treg cells, as well as the expression levels of the immunosuppressive molecules, including tumor growth factor beta (TGF-b), CD39, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related (GITR) protein, and the levels of the intracellular immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-35, in Treg cells obtained from peripheral blood of elderly donors, significantly increased in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo, when compared to the group of young donors. Conversely, in the group of young donors were observed a decrease in the expression of these markers and an increase in the concentration of extracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ ex vivo, which activate the effector immune cells and contribute to virus elimination. 
In summary, the presented results suggest that Treg cells derived from elderly individuals exhibit elevated immunosuppressive activity in response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo. Obtained results may indicate that in elderly individuals on the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection Treg cells may also possess enhanced immunosuppressive activity, which may contribute to the overall suppression of anti-viral immune responses, thereby potentially leading to the delayed SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance and development of severe forms of the disease.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are critical human pathogens that continually expand to naïve populations and for which there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain. Author Summary Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes brain inflammation in both animals and humans when transmitted by mosquito bite or infectious aerosols. The mechanisms underlying disease caused by VEEV, including the role of the immune response in brain pathology, are not well understood. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the immune response to VEEV in the brain over time using two advanced sequencing techniques. Following infection, immune cells infiltrate the brain in a sequential fashion and display different activation profiles. Different types of immune cells also display strikingly different spatial patterns throughout the brain. This study provides the most comprehensive description of the immune response to VEEV in the brain performed to date and advances our understanding of immune-driven neuropathology and identification of therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="There is a complex interplay between viral infection and host innate immune response regarding disease severity and outcomes. Neutrophil hyperactivation, including excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is linked to exacerbated disease in acute COVID-19, notably in hospitalized patients. Delineating protective versus detrimental neutrophil responses is essential to developing targeted COVID-19 therapies and relies on high-quality translational animal models. In this study, we utilize a previously established feline model for COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil dysfunction in which experimentally infected cats develop clinical disease that mimics acute COVID-19. Specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2; Delta variant) (n = 24) or vehicle (n = 6). Plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues were collected at various time points over 12 days post-inoculation. Systematic and temporal evaluation of the kinetics of neutrophil activation was conducted by measuring markers of activation including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cats at 4 and 12 days post-inoculation (dpi) and compared to vehicle-inoculated controls. Cytokine profiling supported elevated innate inflammatory responses with specific upregulation of neutrophil activation and NET formation-related markers, namely IL-8, IL-18, CXCL1, and SDF-1, in infected cats. An increase in MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free dsDNA in infected cats compared to vehicle-inoculated was noted and supported by histopathologic severity in respiratory tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses further supported correlation of NET markers with tissue damage, especially 4 dpi. Differential gene expression analyses indicated an upregulation of genes associated with innate immune and neutrophil activation pathways. Transcripts involved in activation and NETosis pathways were upregulated by 4 dpi and downregulated by 12 dpi, suggesting peak activation of neutrophils and NET-associated markers in the early acute stages of infection. Correlation analyses conducted between NET-specific markers and clinical scores as well as histopathologic scores support association between neutrophil activation and disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model. Overall, this study emphasizes the effect of neutrophil activation and NET release in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a feline model, prompting further investigation into therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating excessive innate inflammatory responses in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) remain a significant global cause of mortality and disability. Viruses constitute a substantial proportion of LRTI cases, with their pandemic potential posing a latent threat. After the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the resurgence of other respiratory viruses, including Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus responsible for LRTI has been observed especially in susceptible populations.


AREAS COVERED
This review details the inflammatory mechanisms associated with three primary respiratory viruses: SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The focus will be on elucidating the activation of inflammatory pathways, understanding cellular contributions to inflammation, exploring the role of interferon and induced cell death in the response to these pathogens and detailing viral evasion mechanisms. Furthermore, the distinctive characteristics of each virus will be explained.


EXPERT OPINION
The study of viral pneumonia, notably concerning SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and RSV, offers critical insights into infectious and inflammatory mechanisms with wide-ranging implications. Addressing current limitations, such as diagnostic accuracy and understanding host-virus interactions, requires collaborative efforts and investment in technology. Future research holds promise for uncovering novel therapeutic targets, exploring host microbiome roles, and addressing long-term sequelae. Integrating advances in molecular biology and technology will shape the evolving landscape of viral pneumonia research, potentially enhancing global public health outcomes.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable respiratory virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Since its emergence in the early 2000s, SARS has posed significant public health challenges and continues to be a concern. This review provides an overview of current treatment strategies for SARS-CoV and explores the potential utility of herbal molecules in combating this viral infection. The primary treatment approach for SARS-CoV has historically centered on supportive care, which includes oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and antipyretic medications to manage symptoms. However, with the ongoing advancement of medical research and our evolving understanding of the virus, several antiviral drugs have been developed and repurposed to target SARS-CoV. Recent developments in the field of herbal medicine have drawn attention to the potential efficacy of natural compounds in the management of viral infections, including SARS. Herbal molecules, characterized by their diverse bioactive constituents, exhibit antiviral properties that could be harnessed to mitigate SARS symptoms and inhibit viral replication. Ocimum sanctum, Tinospora cordifolia, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Panax ginseng, and Aloe vera have been identified for their immunomodulatory effects. This review highlights promising herbal molecules such as quercetin, and curcumin, which have demonstrated antiviral effects in–vitro and in some preclinical studies. While current treatment strategies for SARS primarily rely on supportive care and antiviral medications, the exploration of herbal molecules presents an exciting avenue for potential adjunctive therapies. Further research is required to validate their efficacy, safety profiles, and mechanisms of action. A holistic approach that combines conventional medicine with herbal remedies may offer new insights into the treatment of SARS and other viral respiratory illnesses.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) persist in many patients for weeks and months after recovery from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent evidence suggests that pathological changes in skeletal muscle may contribute significantly to ongoing pain and fatigue, particularly post-exertional malaise. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PASC-related fatigue by examining skeletal muscle function and circulating factors in affected individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of patients with fatigue-associated PASC who had experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and content in PASC participants compared to healthy controls. This lower respiratory capacity was accompanied by markedly elevated circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (sIL2R), a T cell-specific receptor. In vitro experiments demonstrated that sIL2R directly impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces mitochondrial complex III subunit protein levels in cultured muscle cells. These findings suggest a mechanism linking systemic immune dysregulation to muscle-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC. This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of PASC identifying sIL2R as a promising therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial deficits in PASC-related fatigue and opening avenues for developing targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Problem COVID-19 during pregnancy is linked to increased maternal morbidity and a higher incidence of preterm births, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Cellular senescence, characterized by the irreversible cessation of cell division, is a critical process in placental function and its dysregulation has been implicated in pregnancy complications like preterm birth. Senescence can be induced by various stressors, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and viral infections. Method of Study In this study, we determined whether COVID-19 had an impact on placental senescence. We examined placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=10 term, 4 preterm) compared to uninfected controls (n=10 term, 3 preterm). The placentas were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication (Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins), markers of DNA damage (γH2AX) and oxidative stress (ROS), and senescence (telomere length; cell cycle regulators, SASP). Results While no overall differences in cellular senescence markers were observed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups, we found increased secreted SASP markers and confocal microscopy revealed localized areas of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the placentas from COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces localized placental damage, warranting further investigation into its impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to pathological disorders in various organs due to the ubiquitous of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. However, tissue damage may not only be the result of viral infection. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to induce the production of autoantibodies to ACE2, and their presence is associated with disease severity. The spleen is one of the targets for COVID-19. The presence of ACE2 in the red pulp sinus endothelium cells of the spleen and in tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages positioned in the splenic marginal zone makes these cells a potential target of autoimmune reactions to ACE2 triggered by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein cross-react with a wide range of human tissue proteins and can cause tissue damage. The most common splenic pathologies in deceased COVID-19 patients are lymphocyte depletion and subsequent hemaphagocytosis. Since the spleen plays a fundamental role in the immune response regulation, splenic damage could be one of the causes of immune perturbations associated with severe COVID-19. To test the hypothesis of the autoimmune nature of COVID-19, we developed a non-infectious experimental model of autoimmune multiorgan damage caused by immunization with SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The purpose of this work was to study the spleen in rats with induced multiorgan damage caused by immunization with SARS-CoV-2 S protein, as well as the influence of pre-existing autoimmune disease on the severity of splenic damage caused by an immune response against S protein. Intact Wistar rats and Wistar rats with completed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis were immunized with S protein in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA). Control rats received an injection of IFA. No changes were detected in the secondary follicles number in the spleen of rats immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. However, in the spleen of rats with previously induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis, immunization with SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused a significant decrease in the number of secondary follicles relative to the control group. Hemosiderin deposits and macrophage hyperplasia of the marginal zones of the white pulp were detected in both groups immunized with S protein. Thus, immunization with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 causes changes in the spleen of rats similar to those detected in patients who died from COVID-19. Damage to the spleen is more varied and pronounced in rats with previous experimental encephalomyelitis.">

In this context, we evaluated the impact of immunity induced by the CoronaVac vaccine (Butantan/Sinovac) on intra-host genetic diversity, analyzing 118 whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from unvaccinated and vaccinated patients infected with the Gamma variant. Vaccination with CoronaVac favors negative selection at the intra-host level in different genomic regions.

        <tr id="Secretory (S) IgA antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 are induced in saliva and upper respiratory tract (URT) secretions by natural infection and may be critical in determining the outcome of initial infection. Secretory IgA1 (SIgA1) is the predominant isotype of antibodies in these secretions. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is most effectively accomplished by polymeric antibodies such as SIgA. We hypothesize that cleavage of SIgA1 antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by unique bacterial IgA1 proteases to univalent Fabα antibody fragments with diminished virus neutralizing activity would facilitate the descent of the virus into the lungs to cause serious disease and also enhance its airborne transmission to others. Recent studies of the nasopharyngeal microbiota of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have revealed significant increases in the proportions of IgA1 protease-producing bacteria in comparison with healthy subjects. Similar considerations might apply also to other respiratory viral infections including influenza, possibly explaining the original attribution of influenza to Haemophilus influenzae, which produces IgA1 protease.">

        <tr id="Coronaviruses (CoV) emerge suddenly from animal reservoirs to cause novel diseases in new hosts. Discovered in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in camels in the Middle East and is continually causing local outbreaks and epidemics. While all three newly emerging human CoV from past 20 years (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) cause respiratory disease, each CoV has unique host interactions that drive differential pathogeneses. To better understand the virus and host interactions driving lethal MERS-CoV infection, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics analysis of sublethal and lethal MERS-CoV infection in mice. Significant differences were observed in body weight loss, virus titers and acute lung injury among lethal and sub-lethal virus doses. Virus induced apoptosis of type I and II alveolar epithelial cells suggest that loss or dysregulation of these key cell populations was a major driver of severe disease. Omics analysis suggested differential pathogenesis was multi-factorial with clear differences among innate and adaptive immune pathways as well as those that regulate lung epithelial homeostasis. Infection of mice lacking functional T and B-cells showed that adaptive immunity was important in controlling viral replication but also increased pathogenesis. In summary, we provide a high-resolution host response atlas for MERS-CoV infection and disease severity. Multi-omics studies of viral pathogenesis offer a unique opportunity to not only better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease but also to identify genes and pathways that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention all of which is important for our future pandemic preparedness. Importance Emerging coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV cause a range of disease outcomes in humans from asymptomatic, moderate and severe respiratory disease which can progress to death but the factors causing these disparate outcomes remain unclear. Understanding host responses to mild and life-threatening infection provides insight into virus-host networks within and across organ systems that contribute to disease outcomes. We used multi-omics approaches to comprehensively define the host response to moderate and severe MERS-CoV infection. Severe respiratory disease was associated with dysregulation of the immune response. Key lung epithelial cell populations that are essential for lung function get infected and die. Mice lacking key immune cell populations experienced greater virus replication but decreased disease severity implicating the immune system in both protective and pathogenic roles in the response to MERS-CoV. These data could be utilized to design new therapeutic strategies targeting specific pathways that contribute to severe disease.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and establish a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12 days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the homeostatic and preactivated microglia population decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.">

However, definitive parameters or mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in elderly people remain confused. Thus, this study seeks to elucidate the mechanism behind the increased vulnerability of elderly individuals to severe COVID-19. We employed an aged mouse model with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain to mimic the severe symptoms observed in elderly patients with COVID-19. Comprehensive analyses of the whole lung were performed using transcriptome and proteome sequencing, comparing data from aged and young mice. For transcriptome analysis, bulk RNA sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry following protein extraction, digestion, and peptide labeling. We analyzed the transcriptome and proteome profiles of young and aged mice and discovered that aged mice exhibited elevated baseline levels of inflammation and tissue damage repair. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, aged mice showed increased antiviral and inflammatory responses; however, these responses were weaker than those in young mice, with significant complement and coagulation cascade responses. In summary, our study demonstrates that the increased vulnerability of the elderly to severe COVID-19 can be attributed to an attenuated antiviral response and the overactivation of complement and coagulation cascades.">

        <tr id="Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR1 has been implicated in maintaining self-tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and mediating antiviral immunity. Foreign viral double-stranded RNA triggers rapid interferon response and activates ADAR1 in the host immune system. Emerging data points to a role of ADAR1 A-to-I editing in the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19 disease. We identify A-to-I editing events within human whole transcriptome data from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, non-infected individuals, and individuals with other viral illnesses from nasopharyngeal swabs. High levels of RNA editing in host cells are associated with low SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p = 9.27 E-06), suggesting an inhibitory effect of ADAR1 on viral infection. Additionally, we find differentially expressed genes associated with RNA-modifications and interferon response. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected nasopharyngeal swabs reveals that cytotoxic CD8 T cells upregulate ADAR1 in COVID-19 positive samples (p = 0.0269). We further reveal ADAR1 expression increases with CD4 and CD8 T cell activation, and knockdown of ADAR1 leads to apoptosis and aberrant IL-2 secretion. Together, our data suggests A-to-I RNA editing is required to maintain healthy homeostasis of activated T cells to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a significant public health threat, particularly in children and older adults, with high mortality rates. Some of these pathogens are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza viruses (IV), human parvovirus B19 (B19V), and human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1). These viruses cause various respiratory symptoms, including cough, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Notably, these viruses can also impact the central nervous system (CNS), leading to acute manifestations such as seizures, encephalopathies, encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and long-term complications. The precise mechanisms by which these viruses affect the CNS are not fully understood. Glial cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes within the CNS, play pivotal roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and regulating immune responses. Exploring how these cells interact with viral pathogens, such as hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IVs, B19V, and HBoV1, offers crucial insights into the significant impact of respiratory viruses on the CNS.

Particular focus is given to the interaction between viral genes and proteins with mitochondrial function and that of the innate immune system.

        <tr id="The primary challenge posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is COVID-19-related mortality, often exacerbated by additional medical complications, such as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Up to half of COVID-19 patients experience kidney complications, with those facing acute respiratory failure and kidney injury having the worst overall prognosis. Despite the significant impact of CAKI on COVID-19-related mortality and its enduring effects in long COVID, the underlying causes and molecular mechanisms of CAKI remain elusive. In this study, we identified a functional relationship between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein and inflammation-driven apoptotic death of renal tubular epithelial cells in patients with CAKI. We demonstrate in vitro that ORF3a independently induces renal cell-specific apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by the elevation of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and the activation of NF-kB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine (TNFα and IL-6) production. By examining kidney tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-ACE2 transgenic mice, we observed a similar correlation between ORF3a-induced cytopathic changes and kidney injury. This correlation was further validated through reconstitution of the ORF3a effects via direct adenoviral injection into mouse kidneys. Through medicinal analysis, we identified a natural compound, glycyrrhizin (GL4419), which not only blocks viral replication in renal cells, but also mitigates ORF3a-induced renal cell death by inhibiting activation of a high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, leading to a reduction of KIM-1. Moreover, ORF3a interacts with HMGB1. Overproduction or downregulation of hmgb1 expression results in correlative changes in renal cellular KIM-1 response and respective cytokine production, implicating a crucial role of HMGB1 in ORF3a-inflicted kidney injuries. Our data suggest a direct functional link between ORF3a and kidney injury, highlighting ORF3a as a unique therapeutic target contributing to CAKI.


IMPORTANCE
The major challenge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the pandemic is COVID-19-related mortality, which has tragically claimed millions of lives. COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality are often exacerbated by pre-existing medical conditions, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), or the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to COVID-19, collectively known as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Patients who experience acute respiratory failure with CAKI have the poorest clinical outcomes, including increased mortality. Despite these alarming clinical findings, there is a critical gap in our understanding of the underlying causes of CAKI. Our study establishes a direct correlation between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral ORF3a protein and kidney injury induced by ORF3a linking to CAKI. This functional relationship was initially observed in our clinical studies of COVID-19 patients with AKI and was further validated through animal and in vitro cellular studies, either by expressing ORF3a alone or in the context of viral infection. By elucidating this functional relationship and its underlying mechanistic pathways, our research deepens the understanding of COVID-19-associated kidney diseases and presents potential therapeutic avenues to address the healthcare challenges faced by individuals with underlying conditions.">

        <tr id="From the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, an excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL6, was detected in serum from patients. As a consequence, several anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Dexamethasone (a strong corticoid), were used to counteract such cytokine storm occurring during severe disease. By contrast, pro-inflammatory interleukin 11 (IL11), a member of the IL6 family, was detected in respiratory tissues from infected patients and in experimental epithelial cellular models. In this work, human A549 lung epithelial cells were individually transduced with SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORFs), resulting in a IL11 increase, which was significantly decreased after Dexamethasone treatment. The use of this cellular platform allowed us to screen for new possible anti-inflammatory compounds from Fasciola hepatica. Our results highlighted the ability of FhNEJ (Fasciola hepatica newly excysted juvenile flukes) somatic extract to decrease IL11 levels in ORF-transduced cells. These results emphasized the role of IL11 in lung epithelial inflammation, making it a potential target for future treatments of lung inflammation which occurs in COVID-19, and validate the use of these ORF-expressing cells as a cellular platform to test anti-inflammatory compounds for COVID-19 disease.">

Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

This review explores the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, aging, and obesity in COVID-19. Mitochondria are vital for cellular energy provision and resilience against age-related macromolecule damage accumulation. They manage energy allocation in cells, activating adaptive responses and stress signals such as redox imbalance and innate immunity activation. As organisms age, mitochondrial function diminishes. Aging and obesity, linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, compromise the antiviral response, affecting the release of interferons, and worsening COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, the development of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID has been associated with altered energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation derived from mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the interplay between mitochondria, aging, obesity, and viral infections provides insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. Targeting mitochondrial health may offer potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate severe outcomes and address long-term consequences in infected individuals.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. 350,000 cases are reported annually in the U.S., although that number is expected to increase as climate change expands fungal geographic range. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the symptomatic 40% are often misdiagnosed due to similarities with bronchitis or pneumonia. A small subset of infection progress to severe illness, necessitating a better understanding of immune responses during lethal infection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we characterized lung responses during Coccidioides infection. We identified monocyte-derived Spp1-expressing macrophages as potential mediators of tissue remodeling and fibrosis, marked by high expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory transcripts. These macrophages showed elevated TGF-β and IL-6 signaling, pathways involved in fibrosis pathogenesis. Additionally, we observed significant neutrophil infiltration and defective lymphocyte responses, indicating severe adaptive immunity dysregulation in lethal, acute infection. These findings enhance our understanding of Coccidioides infection and suggest new therapeutic targets. Importance: Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, which is prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. With climate change potentially expanding the geographic range of this fungus, understanding the immune responses during severe infections is crucial. Our study used advanced techniques to analyze lung responses during Coccidioides infection, identifying specific immune cells that may contribute to tissue damage and fibrosis. These findings provide new insights into the disease mechanisms and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention, which could improve outcomes for patients suffering from severe Valley Fever.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant exhibits high transmissibility with a strong immune escape ability and causes frequent large-scale global infections by producing predominant subvariants. Here, using human upper/lower airway and intestinal cells, we examined the previously dominant BA.1–BA.5 and BA.2.75 subvariants, together with the recently emerged XBB/BQ lineages, in comparison to the former Delta variant. We observed a tendency for each virus to demonstrate higher growth capability than the previously dominant subvariants. Unlike human bronchial and intestinal cells, nasal epithelial cells accommodated the efficient entry of certain Omicron subvariants, similar to the Delta variant. In contrast to the Delta’s reliance on cell-surface transmembrane protease serine 2, all tested Omicron variants depended on endosomal cathepsin L. Moreover, S1/S2 cleavage of early Omicron spikes was less efficient, whereas recent viruses exhibit improved cleavage efficacy. Our results show that the Omicron variant progressively adapts to human cells through continuous endosome-mediated host cell entry. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, has evolved into a number of variants/subvariants, which have generated multiple global waves of infection. In order to monitor/predict virological features of emerging variants and determine appropriate strategies for anti-viral development, understanding conserved or altered features of evolving SARS-CoV-2 is important. In this study, we addressed previously or recently predominant Omicron subvariants and demonstrated the gradual adaptation to human cells. The host cell entry route, which was altered from the former Delta variant, was conserved among all tested Omicron subvariants. Collectively, this study revealed both changing and maintained features of SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron variant evolution.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 remains a significant threat to public health globally. Infection in some susceptible individuals causes life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI/ARDS) and/or death. Human surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a C-type lectin expressed in the lung and other mucosal tissues, and it plays a critical role in host defense against various pathogens. The human SP-A genes (SFTPA1 and SFTPA2) are highly polymorphic and comprise several common genetic variants, i.e., SP-A1 (variants 6A2, 6A4) and SP-A2 (variants 1A0, 1A3). Here, we elucidated the differential antiviral and immunoregulatory roles of SP-A variants in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Six genetically-modified mouse lines, expressing both hACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and individual SP-A variants: (hACE2/6A2 (6A2), hACE2/6A4 (6A4), hACE2/1A0 (1A0), and hACE2/1A3(1A3), one SP-A knockout (hACE2/SP-A KO (KO) and one hACE2/mouse SP-A (K18) mice, were challenged intranasally with 103 PFU SARS-CoV-2 or saline (Sham). Infected KO and 1A0 mice had more weight loss and mortality compared to other mouse lines. Relative to other infected mouse lines, a more severe ALI was observed in KO, 1A0, and 6A2 mice. Reduced viral titers were generally observed in the lungs of infected SP-A mice relative to KO mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an upregulation in genes that play central roles in immune responses such as MyD88, Stat3, IL-18, and Jak2 in the lungs of KO and 1A0 mice. However, Mapk1 was significantly downregulated in 6A2 versus 1A0 mice. Analysis of biological pathways identified those involved in lung host defense and innate immunity, including pathogen-induced cytokine, NOD1/2, and Trem1 signaling pathways. Consistent with the transcriptomic data, levels of cytokines and chemokines such as G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-1β were comparatively higher in the lungs and sera of KO and 1A0 mice with the highest mortality rate. These findings demonstrate that human SP-A variants differentially modulate SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and disease severity by differentially inhibiting viral infectivity and regulating immune-related gene expressions.">

        <tr id="Direct and indirect transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been attributed to virus survival in droplets, bioaerosols and on fomites including skin and surfaces. Survival of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) on the skin and virus transference following rounds of skin-to-skin contact were assessed on porcine skin as a surrogate for human skin. SARS-CoV-2 variants were detectable on skin by RT-qPCR after 72 h at biologically relevant temperatures (35.2 °C) with viral RNA (vRNA) detected after ten successive skin-to-skin contacts. Skin-to-skin virus transmission to establish infection in ferrets as a model for mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in mustelids and humans was also investigated and compared to intranasal ferret inoculation. Naïve ferrets exposed to Delta variant SARS-CoV-2 in a 'wet' or 'dry' form on porcine skin resulted in robust infection with shedding detectable for up to 14 days post-exposure, at comparable viral loads to ferrets inoculated intranasally. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to naïve ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets was achieved, with environmental contamination detected from ferret fur swabs and air samples. Genetic substitutions were identified in bioaerosol samples acquired following single contact passage in ferrets, including Spike, ORF1ab, and ORF3a protein sequences, suggesting a utility for monitoring host adaptation and virus evolution via air sampling. The longevity of SARS-CoV-2 variants survival directly on the skin and skin-to-skin transference, enabling subsequent infection via the skin to oro-nasal contact route, could represent a pathway for SARS-CoV-2 infection with implications to public and veterinary health.">

        <tr id="Introduction Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a global respiratory disease, which annually leads to 3-5 million cases of severe illness, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths. Additionally, during the past century, four global IAV pandemics have claimed millions of human lives. The epithelial lining of the trachea plays a vital role during IAV infection, both as point of viral entry and replication as well as in the antiviral immune response. Tracheal tissue is generally inaccessible from human patients, which makes animal models crucial for the study of the tracheal host immune response. Method In this study, pigs were inoculated with swine- or human-adapted H1N1 IAV to gain insight into how host adaptation of IAV shapes the innate immune response during infection. In-depth multi-omics analysis (global proteomics and RNA sequencing) of the host response in upper and lower tracheal tissue was conducted, and results were validated by microfluidic qPCR. Additionally, a subset of samples was selected for histopathological examination. Results A classical innate antiviral immune response was induced in both upper and lower trachea after infection with either swine- or human-adapted IAV with upregulation of genes and higher abundance of proteins associated with viral infection and recognition, accompanied by a significant induction of interferon stimulated genes with corresponding higher proteins concentrations. Infection with the swine-adapted virus induced a much stronger immune response compared to infection with a human-adapted IAV strain in the lower trachea, which could be a consequence of a higher viral load and a higher degree of inflammation. Discussion Central components of the JAK-STAT pathway, apoptosis, pyrimidine metabolism, and the cytoskeleton were significantly altered depending on infection with swine- or human-adapted virus and might be relevant mechanisms in relation to antiviral immunity against putative zoonotic IAV. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that during host adaptation, IAV evolve to modulate important host cell elements to favor viral infectivity and replication.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cutaneous mycobacterial infections cause substantial morbidity and are challenging to diagnose and treat. An improved understanding of the dermal immune response to mycobacteria may inspire new therapeutic approaches. We conducted a controlled human infection study with 10 participants who received 2 × 106 CFUs of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (Tice strain) intradermally and were randomized to receive isoniazid or no treatment. Peripheral blood was collected at multiple time points for flow cytometry, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and serum Ab assessments. Systemic immune responses were detected as early as 8 d postchallenge in this M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin–naive population. Injection-site skin biopsies were performed at days 3 and 15 postchallenge and underwent immune profiling using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq, as well as quantitative assessments of bacterial viability and burden. Molecular viability testing and standard culture results correlated well, although no differences were observed between treatment arms. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed various immune and nonimmune cell types in the skin, and communication between them was inferred by ligand-receptor gene expression. Day 3 communication was predominantly directed toward monocytes from keratinocyte, muscle, epithelial, and endothelial cells, largely via the migration inhibitory factor pathway and HLA-E–KLRK1 interaction. At day 15, communication was more balanced between cell types. These data reveal the potential role of nonimmune cells in the dermal immune response to mycobacteria and the utility of human challenge studies to augment our understanding of mycobacterial infections.">

        <tr id="Background. Currently, the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute damage to organs and systems caused by coronavirus infection have been studied quite fully, but the mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of long COVID have not yet been accurately described. The mechanisms of persistence of a number of symptoms in patients who have had COVID-19 and the role of systemic inflammation and endotoxemia markers in it remain a understudied aspect and a promising direction for further studying.The aim of the study. To assess the markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxin-releasing systems, intestinal permeability and endothelial dysfunction in patients with long COVID at the stage of health resort treatment.Methods. The study included 32 patients who had recovered from coronavirus infection and were undergoing health resort treatment in the pulmonology department of the I.M. Sechenov Academic Research Institute for Physical Therapy, Medical Climatology and Rehabilitation. We also selected a control group (n = 20). All patients underwent peripheral blood analysis to detect the levels of markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxin-releasing systems, intestinal permeability, endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstrictor agents: C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LPB), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), zonulin, bactericidal/ permeability-increasing protein (BPI), vasopressors of angiotensin 2 and endothelin (EDN1).Results. Patients who had recovered from coronavirus infection had a statistically significant increase in the levels of CRP (3.4 [2.56; 4.0] mg/l), LBP (18.46 [14.0; 25.5] ng/ml), tPA (0.07 [0.02; 0.32] ng/ml), angiotensin 2 (133.3 [63.0; 503.7] pg/ml) and a decrease in the level of BPI (1576 [276; 3588] pg/ml) (p < 0.05).Conclusion. A statistically significant increase in markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxinemia, and vasoconstrictor agents in patients with long COVID indicates an imbalance in endotoxin-binding and endotoxin-releasing systems in patients who have had coronavirus infection. Further study of the described markers is necessary to improve approaches to long-term personalized therapy for this category of patients.">

We found that the myeloid cell populations were significantly changed by SIVE. In SIVE microglia-like cells express high levels of chemoattractants capable of recruiting highly activated CAM-like cells to the site of infection/inflammation. A unique population of microglia-like cells was found in which the chromatin accessibility of genes diverged from their RNA expression. Additionally, we observed a dramatic shift of upstream gene regulators and their targets in brain myeloid cells during SIVE.

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, advanced age has emerged as a major predictor of disease severity. Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms explaining how old age constitutes a critical risk factor remains elusive. To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19. Author summary In this study, we investigated why older age is linked to more severe COVID-19 outcomes by comparing the progression of the disease in young (2 months) and elderly (15-22 months) K18(hACE2) mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. After exposing both groups to the virus, we assessed various factors such as viral loads, immune responses, and lipid profiles in the lungs at different time points. Our findings revealed that elderly mice struggled to clear the virus by day 7 post-infection, leading to higher mortality rates and poorer recovery compared to younger mice. Aged mice showed weaker immune responses, with reduced production of key antiviral proteins like IFNg and certain chemokines. Lipid analysis also highlighted differences in molecules involved in immune regulation and lung protection, such as decreased levels of pro-resolving lipids and increased lipids associated with lung injury. These results suggest that older mice have a compromised antiviral defense, which could inform new therapeutic approaches for elderly patients with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="While several viral infections have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the mechanism(s) through which they promote disease has remained almost entirely elusive. This study investigated the impact of common, acute viral infections prior to disease onset on ALS progression in the SOD1G93A mouse model. A single sublethal infection prior to onset of ALS clinical signs was associated with markedly accelerated ALS disease progression characterized by rapid loss of hindlimb function. Prior infection resulted in gliosis in the lumbar spine and upregulation of transcriptional pathways involved in inflammatory responses, metabolic dysregulation, and muscular dysfunction. Therapeutic suppression of gliosis with an anti-inflammatory small molecule, or administration of a direct-acting antiviral, was associated with significantly improved ALS clinical signs, akin to what was observed in uninfected animals. This study provides causal and mechanistic evidence that the immune response elicited by acute viral infections may be an important etiological factor that alters ALS disease trajectory, and provides insight into novel therapeutic and preventative strategies for ALS.

        <tr id="Although vaccines have reduced the burden of COVID-19, their efficacy in helminth infection–endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal roundworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in mice. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA-vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared with animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth-mediated suppression of spike protein–specific CD8+ T cell responses occurred independently of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling, whereas blockade of interleukin-10 (IL-10) rescued vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses. Together, these data show that, in mice, intestinal helminth infection impaired vaccine-induced T cell responses through an IL-10 pathway, which compromised protection against antigenically drifted SARS-CoV-2 variants. Intestinal helminth infection blunts T cell responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in mice. Editor’s summary Much of the global population lives in areas endemic to helminths, which are known to affect responses to vaccines. To discern how helminth infection affects responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, Desai et al. infected mice with the hookworm Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) during the course of a primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series. The authors found that Hpb infection compromised T cell, but not antibody, responses to SARS-CoV-2 in an IL-10–dependent manner. Although Hpb-infected K18-hACE2 mice were protected from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 challenge through their antibody responses, they were more susceptible to challenge with an Omicron variant, which can evade antibodies but is still susceptible to T cell responses. Together, these data highlight the need to keep helminth infections in mind during vaccine development and deployment. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus infected more than 775,686,716 humans and was responsible for the death of more than 7,054,093 individuals. COVID-19 has taught us that the development of vaccines, repurposing of drugs, and understanding the mechanism of a disease can be done within a short time. The COVID-19 proteomics and metabolomics has contributed to its diagnosis, understanding of its progression, host-virus interaction, disease mechanism, and also in the search of suitable anti-COVID therapeutics. Mass spectrometry based proteomics was used to find the potential biomarkers of different stages of COVID-19 including severe and nonsevere cases in the blood serum. Notably, protein-protein interaction techniques to understand host-virus interactions were also significantly useful. The single-cell proteomics studies were carried out to ascertain the changes in immune cell composition and its activation in mild COVID-19 patients versus severe COVID-19 patients using whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Modern technologies were helpful to deal with the pandemic; however, there is still scope for further development. Further, attempts were made to understand the protein-protein, metabolite-metabolite, and protein-metabolite interactomes, derived from proteins and metabolite fingerprints of COVID-19 patients by reanalysis of COVID-19 public mass spectrometry based proteomics and metabolomics studies. Further, some of these interactions were supported by the literature as validations in the COVID-19 studies.">

        <tr id="MPOX virus (MPXV), formerly known as monkeypox virus, led to a rapidly evolving pandemic starting May 2022, with over 90,000 cases reported beyond the African continent. This pandemic outbreak was driven by the MPXV variant Clade IIb. In addition, Clade I viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are drawing increased attention as cases constantly rise and Clade Ib, first identified in 2023, is now co-circulating with Clade Ia and seems to exhibit enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. While most infected individuals display a self-limiting disease with singular pox-like lesions, some endure systemic viral spread leading to whole-body rash with risks for necrosis, organ loss, and death. Intra-host dissemination and cellular tropism of MPXV are largely unexplored in humans. To establish a potential susceptibility of circulating immune cells to MPXV, we exposed human PBMCs from healthy donors ex vivo to a currently circulating MPXV clade IIb virus isolate in absence and presence of IFN-α2a. qPCR of DNA extracted from cell lysates, but less from supernatants, revealed increasing MPXV DNA quantities that peaked at five to six days post-exposure, suggesting susceptibility of PBMCs to infection. IFN-α2a pretreatment markedly reduced the quantity of MPXV DNA, suggesting that infection is sensitive to type I IFNs. Plaque assays from supernatants showed that infection gave rise to de novo production of infectious MPXV. In virus-inclusive scRNA-sequencing, monocytes, cycling NK cells and regulatory CD4+ T-cells scored positive for viral RNA, suggesting that these are the MPXV-susceptible cell types within the human PBMC population. Analysis of differentially expressed genes displayed a pronounced downregulation of expression pathways driving innate immunity in MPXV-infected cells, a well-established feature of poxviral infection. Pretreatment of PBMCs with current antivirals Cidofovir and Tecovirimat resulted in reduced amounts of viral antigen production and of released infectivity, suggesting suitability of the human PBMC infection model as a platform for evaluation of current and future antivirals and justifying trials to investigate Cidofovir and Tecovirimat as drugs reducing intra-patient viral spread. Together, our data suggest that human PBMCs are productively infected by MPXV which is accompanied by significant modulation of the cellular milieu. Our results have the potential to illuminate aspects of intra-host propagation of MPXV that may involve a lymphohematogenous route for replication and/or intra-host dissemination.">

        <tr id="Some respiratory viruses, such as Human Rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68), share the feature of hijacking host lipids in order to generate specialised replication organelles (ROs) with unique lipid compositions to enable viral replication. We have recently uncovered a novel non-canonical function of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, as a critical factor in the formation of ROs in response to HRV infection. The STING pathway is the main DNA virus sensing system of the innate immune system controlling the type I IFN machinery. Although it is well-characterised as part of the DNA sensor machinery, the STING function in RNA viral infections is largely unexplored. In the current study, we investigated whether other RO-forming RNA viruses, such as EV-D68 and SARS-CoV-2, can also utilise STING for their replication. Using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, we demonstrate that STING is hijacked by these viruses and is utilised as part of the viral replication machinery. STING also co-localises with glycolytic enzymes needed to fuel the energy for replication. The inhibition of STING leads to the modulation of glucose metabolism in EV-D68-infected cells, suggesting that it might also manipulate immunometabolism. Therefore, for RO-generating RNA viruses, STING seems to have non-canonical functions in membrane lipid re-modelling, and the formation of replication vesicles, as well as immunometabolism.">

        <tr id="Purpose. A virus, when it infects a host organism, multiplies its ribonucleic acid (RNA) to make it more harmful. We analyze if a view-based temporal template method, the motion history image (MHI) algorithm, may be of use to extract information on the progression of viral interactions over time. Methods. We employ an alternative online processing modality to comprehend and analyze the replication dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). The data are evaluated using the computation of a quantitative algorithm, the absolute value of differences (AVD), followed by the generation of temporal template map, the MHI of viral contact. Results. We show that the MHI identifies various stages to examine cultural characteristics and information on the progression of viral interactions over time. The results are more easily obtained compared to a visual inspection of the frames constituting the recordings. MHI also has the advantage of relying on a simple algorithm. The AVD index further provides deeper insights into the dynamics of the viral interaction over time, and its measurement suggests that SARS CoV-2 virus is becoming more widespread. This study shows that the replication process damages the host cell over time, in addition to causing SARS CoV-2 to proliferate. Conclusions. The MHI provides a framework for automated feature extraction from time series data. The combined approach results in decreased computational complexity and enables online assessment of the assay. Clinical and research studies can be conducted to evaluate MHI and AVD and their utility in aiding diagnostic analysis.">

        <tr id="The unprecedented research effort associated with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) included several extensive proteomic studies that identified host proteins that interact with individual viral gene products. However, in most cases, the consequences of those virus–host interactions for virus replication were not experimentally pursued, which is a necessary step in determining whether the interactions represent pro- or anti-viral events. One putative interaction commonly identified in multiple studies was between the host adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) subunit B1 (AP3B1) and the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E). AP3B1 is one subunit of AP-3 required for the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles (LROs), and its function impacts important disease processes including inflammation and vascular health. Thus, interactions between AP3B1 and SARS-CoV-2 might influence the clinical outcomes of infection. To determine if AP3B1 has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, we first confirmed the interaction in virus-infected cells using immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). AP3B1 is required by multiple viruses to aid in the replication cycle and therefore may be a therapeutic target. However, we found that the overexpression of AP3B1 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas the siRNA-mediated depletion of AP3B1 increased the release of infectious virus, suggesting an antiviral role for AP3B1. Together, our findings suggest that AP3B1 is an intrinsic barrier to SARS-CoV-2 replication through interactions with the viral E protein. Our work justifies further investigations of LRO trafficking in SARS-CoV-2 target cells and their role in viral pathogenesis.">

MOG-specific T cells then invade into the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neuronal demyelination. Microglia, innate immune cells in the CNS are known to regulate various neuronal diseases. However, the role of microglia in EAE has remained elusive. BRD4 is a BET protein expressed in microglia, whether BRD4 in microglia contributes to EAE has not been determined. We show that EAE pathology was markedly reduced with microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout (cKO). In these mice, microglia- T cell interactions were greatly reduced, leading to the lack of T cell reactivation. Microglia specific transcriptome data showed downregulation of genes required for interaction with and reactivation of T cells in Brd4 cKO samples. In summary, BRD4 plays a critical role in regulating microglia function in normal and EAE CNS. Summary This study demonstrates that in a EAE model, microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout mice were defective in expressing genes required for microglia- T cells interaction and those involved in neuroinflammation, and demyelination resulting in fewer CNS T cell invasion and display marked reduction in EAE pathology.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 include several comorbidities, but age was the most striking one since elderly people were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the reasons for this markedly unfavorable response in the elderly, immunosenescence and inflammaging appear as major drivers of this outcome. A finding that was also notable was that hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 have an accumulation of senescent T cells, suggesting that immunosenescence may be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present work was designed to examine whether these immunosenescence changes are characteristic of COVID-19 and whether it is dependent on disease severity using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our cross-sectional data show that COVID-19, but not other respiratory infections, rapidly increased cellular senescence and exhaustion in CD4 and CD8 T cells during early infection. In addition, longitudinal analyses with patients from Brazil and Portugal provided evidence of increased frequencies of senescent and exhausted T cells over a 7-d period in patients with mild/moderate and severe COVID-19. Altogether, the study suggests that accelerated immunosenescence in CD4 and especially CD8 T-cell compartments may represent a common and unique outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS), characterized by debilitating symptoms like persistent fatigue, cardiovascular symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction. Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: In this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n=204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Results: Plasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.">

        <tr id="Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis and meningitis are potential central nervous system (CNS) complications following primary VZV infection or reactivation. With Type-I interferon (IFN) signalling being an important first line cellular defence mechanism against VZV infection by the peripheral tissues, we here investigated the triggering of innate immune responses in a human neural-like environment. For this, we established and characterised 5-month matured hiPSC-derived neurospheroids (NSPHs) containing neurons and astrocytes. Subsequently, NSPHs were infected with reporter strains of VZV (VZVeGFP-ORF23) or Sendai virus (SeVeGFP), with the latter serving as an immune-activating positive control. Live cell and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated VZVeGFP-ORF23 infection throughout the NSPHs, while SeVeGFP infection was limited to the outer NSPH border. Next, NanoString digital transcriptomics revealed that SeVeGFP-infected NSPHs activated a clear Type-I IFN response, while this was not the case in VZVeGFP-ORF23-infected NSPHs. Moreover, the latter displayed a strong suppression of genes related to IFN signalling and antigen presentation, as further demonstrated by suppression of IL-6 and CXCL10 production, failure to upregulate Type-I IFN activated anti-viral proteins (Mx1, IFIT2 and ISG15), as well as reduced expression of CD74, a key-protein in the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway. Finally, even though VZVeGFP-ORF23-infection seems to be immunologically ignored in NSPHs, its presence does result in the formation of stress granules upon long-term infection, as well as disruption of cellular integrity within the infected NSPHs. Concluding, in this study we demonstrate that 5-month matured hiPSC-derived NSPHs display functional innate immune reactivity towards SeV infection, and have the capacity to recapitulate the strong immune evasive behaviour towards VZV.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants harboring mutations in the structural protein, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, have raised concern about potential immune escape. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in infection and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies. The mutations that occur in the structural proteins, especially in the spike protein, lead to changes in the virus attributes of transmissibility, an increase in disease severity, a notable reduction in neutralizing antibodies generated and thus a decreased response to vaccines and therapy. The observed multiple mutations in the RBD of the spike protein showed immune escape because it increases the affinity of spike protein binding with the ACE-2 receptor of host cells and increases resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections from the infected tissues and clearing them from circulation. Cytotoxic T cells efficiently recognized the infected cells and killed them by releasing soluble mediator's perforin and granzymes. However, the overwhelming response of T cells and, subsequently, the overproduction of inflammatory mediators during severe infections with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to poor outcomes. This review article summarizes the impact of mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations of RBD, on immunogenicity, immune escape and vaccine-induced immunity, which could contribute to future studies focusing on vaccine design and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune dysregulation and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia have been implicated in fatal COVID-19 disease. However, how these two factors interact to shape disease outcomes is unclear.


METHODS
We carried out viral and immunological phenotyping on a prospective cohort of 280 patients with COVID-19 presenting to acute care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts and Genoa, Italy between June 1, 2020 and February 8, 2022. Disease severity, mortality, plasma viremia, and immune dysregulation were assessed. A mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection was used to analyze the therapeutic potential of Notch4 and pyroptosis inhibition in disease outcome.


RESULTS
Stratifying patients based on %Notch4+ Treg cells and/or the presence of plasma viremia identified four subgroups with different clinical trajectories and immune phenotypes. Patients with both high %Notch4+ Treg cells and viremia suffered the most disease severity and 90-day mortality compared to the other groups even after adjusting for baseline comorbidities. Increased Notch4 and plasma viremia impacted different arms of the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased Notch4 was associated with decreased Treg cell amphiregulin expression and suppressive function whereas plasma viremia was associated with increased monocyte cell pyroptosis. Combinatorial therapies using Notch4 blockade and pyroptosis inhibition induced stepwise protection against mortality in a mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection.


CONCLUSIONS
The clinical trajectory and survival outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is predicated on two cardinal factors in disease pathogenesis: viremia and Notch4+ Treg cells. Intervention strategies aimed at resetting the immune dysregulation in COVID-19 by antagonizing Notch4 and pyroptosis may be effective in severe cases of viral lung infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Extracellular Traps (ETs) are fibers composed of chromatin and cytoplasmic proteins, which can trap and kill pathogens by the phenomenon called ETosis. They are released by neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, and can be found in semen. The aim of this presentation is to evidence of the indirect effect of SARS-CoV-2 in semen by ETs. Patients and methods: Experimental design: retrospective descriptive observational study. Semen samples from two groups were studied following WHO guidelines: 1) SARS-CoV-2 infected donors (n: 5; at 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after PCR diagnosis); 2) COVID-19 positive patients assisted in our laboratory between 2021 and 2022 (n: 70). They were observed in fresh and in Papanicolaou-stained smears by CASA and light microscopy; the presence of macrophages, spermiophages, ETs and hyperviscosity were recorded while neutrophilic concentration was calculated. Two control groups were designed: a) Patients belonging to group 2, studied before de pandemia (n: 13); b) Culture-negative semen samples (n: 28). Results: In the first group, ETs were observed in all the samples, while only 18% had leucospermia. Macrophages, spermiophages, and hyperviscosity were recorded in 68%, 27%, and 36% of the studied cases respectively. In the second group, ETs were present 100% in the acute phase (< 90 days after diagnosis) and decreased to 71% in the later stage (90 to 270 days). The trapped sperm were non-progressive motile or immotile alive or dead. No traps were found in either control group. Conclusion: In our study ETs were the most sensitive seminal marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Disease severity is influenced by an exacerbated immune response, characterized by high pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Inhibition of AKT can potentially suppress pathological inflammation, cytokine storm and platelet activation associated with COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to investigate the rs2494746 and rs1130214 variants in the AKT1 gene associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes.Peripheral blood samples and sociodemographic data from 508 individuals with COVID-19, measuring plasma cytokine concentrations using ELISA and genotyped the AKT1 variants.The rs2494746-C allele was associated with severity, ICU admission, and death from COVID-19. The C allele at rs1130214 was linked to increased TNF and D-dimer levels. Moreover, both variants exhibited an increased cumulative risk of disease severity, ICU admission, and mortality caused by COVID-19. In the predictive analysis, the rs2494746 obtained an accuracy of 71%, suggesting a high probability of the test determining the severity of the disease.Our findings contribute to understanding the influence of the AKT1 gene variants on the immunological damage in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the critical need to integrate immunomics within the One Health framework to effectively address zoonotic diseases across humans, animals, and environments. Employing advanced high-throughput technologies, this interdisciplinary approach reveals the complex immunological interactions among these systems, enhancing our understanding of immune responses and yielding vital insights into the mechanisms that influence viral spread and host susceptibility. Significant advancements in immunomics have accelerated vaccine development, improved viral mutation tracking, and broadened our comprehension of immune pathways in zoonotic transmissions. This review highlights the role of animals, not merely as carriers or reservoirs, but as essential elements of ecological networks that profoundly influence viral epidemiology. Furthermore, we explore how environmental factors shape immune response patterns across species, influencing viral persistence and spillover risks. Moreover, case studies demonstrating the integration of immunogenomic data within the One Health framework for COVID-19 are discussed, outlining its implications for future research. However, linking humans, animals, and the environment through immunogenomics remains challenging, including the complex management of vast amounts of data and issues of scalability. Despite challenges, integrating immunomics data within the One Health framework significantly enhances our strategies and responses to zoonotic diseases and pandemic threats, marking a crucial direction for future public health breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains endemic worldwide ∼5 years since the first documented case. Severe COVID-19 is widely considered to be caused by a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 within the respiratory tract. Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged 4-6 month old C57BL/6 mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice 4 days post infection and before death were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in the lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), causes post-acute infection syndrome in a surprisingly large number of cases worldwide. This condition, also known as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, is characterized by extremely complex symptoms and pathology. There is a growing consensus that this condition is a consequence of virus-induced immune activation and the inflammatory cascade, with its prolonged duration caused by a persistent virus reservoir.In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response against the spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins, as well as the levels of spike-specific IgG antibodies in 51 healthcare workers, categorized into long COVID or convalescent control groups based on the presence or absence of post-acute symptoms. Additionally, we compared the levels of autoantibodies previously identified during acute or critical COVID-19, including anti-dsDNA, anti-cardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO). Furthermore, we analyzed the antibody levels targeting six nuclear antigens within the ENA-6 S panel, as positivity for certain anti-nuclear antibodies has recently been shown to associate not only with acute COVID-19 but also with long COVID. Finally, we examined the frequency of diabetes in both groups. Our investigations were conducted at an average of 18.2 months (convalescent control group) and 23.1 months (long COVID group) after confirmed acute COVID-19 infection, and an average of 21 months after booster vaccination.Our results showed significant differences between the two groups regarding the occurrence of acute infection relative to administering the individual vaccine doses, the frequency of acute symptoms, and the T cell response against all structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A statistical association was observed between the incidence of long COVID symptoms and highly elevated anti-TPO antibodies based on Pearson's chi-squared test. Although patients with long COVID showed moderately elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG serum antibody levels compared to control participants, and further differences were found regarding the positivity for anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, and HbA1c levels between the two groups, these differences were not statistically significant.This study highlights the need for close monitoring of long COVID development in patients with elevated anti-TPO titers, which can be indicated by strongly elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response and moderately raised anti-spike IgG levels even long after the acute infection. However, our results do not exclude the possibility of new-onset thyroid autoimmunity after COVID-19, and further investigations are required to clarify the etiological link between highly elevated anti-TPO titers and long COVID.">

        <tr id="We previously demonstrated that the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients were filled with a clear hydrogel consisting of hyaluronan (HA). In this translational study, we investigated the role of HA at all stages of COVID-19 disease to map the consequences of elevated HA on morbidity and identify the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced HA production. A reduced alveolar surface area was observed in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, as visualized by a 3D rendering of lung morphology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. We confirmed the presence of HA in lung biopsies and found large quantities of proinflammatory fragmented HA. The association of systemic HA in blood plasma and disease severity was assessed in patients with mild (WHO Clinical Progression Scale, WHO-CPS, 1-5) and severe COVID-19 (WHO-CPS, 6-9) during the acute and convalescent phases and related to lung function. We found that systemic levels of HA were high during acute COVID-19 disease, remained elevated during convalescence, and were associated with a reduced diffusion capacity. In vitro 3D-lung models, differentiated from primary human bronchial epithelial cells, were used to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HA metabolism, and transcriptomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of HA synthases and hyaluronidases, both contributing to increased HA in apical secretions. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment reduced the inflammation and downregulated HA synthases. Our findings demonstrate that HA plays a role in COVID-19 morbidity and that sustained elevated HA concentrations may contribute to long-term respiratory impairment.IMPORTANCEThis study provides insights into the role of hyaluronan (HA) in the severity and long-term impact of COVID-19 on lung function. Through extensive morphological examination of lung tissues and a multicenter study, we identified that HA levels are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, correlating with a reduced lung diffusion capacity during convalescence. Using a 3D-lung model, we further uncovered how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a dysregulated HA metabolism, leading to increased HA production. Our findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting HA metabolism could offer new therapeutic avenues for managing COVID-19, particularly to prevent long-term lung impairment. Additionally, HA holds potential as a biomarker for predicting disease severity, which could guide personalized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Optic neuritis (ON), one of the clinical manifestations of the human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS), was also reported in patients with COVID-19 infection, highlighting one potential neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2. However, the mechanism of ON in these patients is poorly understood.


EVIDENCE ACQUISITION
Insight may be gained by studying the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), a β-coronavirus that belongs to the same family as SARS-CoV-2.


RESULTS
Mouse hepatitis virus-A59, or its isogenic spike protein recombinant strains, inoculation in mice provides an important experimental model to understand underpinning mechanisms of neuroinflammatory demyelination in association with acute stage optic nerve inflammation and chronic stage optic nerve demyelination concurrent with axonal loss. Spike is a surface protein that mediates viral binding and entry into host cells, as well as cell-cell fusion and viral spread. Studies have implicated spike-mediated mechanisms of virus-induced neuroinflammatory demyelination by comparing naturally occurring demyelinating (DM) and nondemyelinating (NDM) MHV strains.


CONCLUSIONS
Here, we summarize findings in MHV-induced experimental ON and myelitis, using natural DM and NDM strains as well as engineered recombinant strains of MHV to understand the role of spike protein in inducing ON and demyelinating disease pathology. Potential parallels in human coronavirus-mediated ON and demyelination, and insight into potential therapeutic strategies, are discussed.">

        <tr id="The incidence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased dramatically in recent years, affecting millions of people worldwide. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients is respiratory illness. However, the disease can also significantly impact the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. ACE-2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a crucial role in regulating various pathological processes. The interaction of the virus with ACE-2 in the myocardium can lead to direct heart damage. Several mechanisms may contribute to myocardial damage in COVID-19 patients, including systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon-mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response, T-cell-mediated damage, coronary plaque instability, and hypoxia. There has been concern that ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 by upregulating ACE-2 expression. However, it may be advisable to continue medications for patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders. The precise mechanisms of cardiomyocyte injury in COVID-19 are not fully understood, but necroptosis appears to play a significant role. Current treatments for cardiac damage in COVID-19 patients include IL-6 blockers and antiplatelet therapy. Ponatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed using computational and structural approaches, has shown the potential to affect cell death through its impact on tyrosine kinase activity. By reviewing studies related to ponatinib's effects on necroptosis and cell death, we propose a novel approach to potentially reduce the cardiotoxic effects of COVID-19 on cardiomyocytes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac injury in COVID-19 and to develop targeted therapies to protect the heart from the devastating effects of this disease.">

        <tr id="Neutrophilia occurs in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and is predictive of poor outcomes. Here, we link heterogenous neutrophil populations to disease severity in COVID-19. We identified neutrophils with features of cellular aging and immunosuppressive capacity in mild COVID-19 and features of neutrophil immaturity and activation in severe disease. The low-density neutrophil (LDN) number in circulating blood correlated with COVID-19 severity. Many of the divergent neutrophil phenotypes in COVID-19 were overrepresented in the LDN fraction and were less detectable in normal-density neutrophils. Functionally, neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 displayed defects in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species production. Soluble factors secreted by neutrophils from these patients inhibited T cell proliferation. Neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 had increased expression of arginase-1 protein, a feature that was retained in convalescent patients. Despite this increase in intracellular expression, there was a reduction in arginase-1 release by neutrophils into serum and culture supernatants. Furthermore, neutrophil-mediated T cell suppression was independent of arginase-1. Our results indicate the presence of dysfunctional, activated, and immature neutrophils in severe COVID-19.">

Given that the activity of neutrophils has not been described in these patients, we aimed to investigate the function of neutrophils at ICU admission and on Day 7 (D7) post admission. Neutrophil maturation and several functional indicators were investigated. We detected a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species production at D7, but we did not observe any other significant alterations in neutrophil function. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage obtained from patients displayed no inhibitory effect on the function of neutrophils from healthy donors. These findings indicate that patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS do not acquire neutrophil dysfunction within the first week of their stay, which suggests that nosocomial infections among these patients are not due to acquired neutrophil dysfunctions.">

        <tr id="Respiratory fungal infections pose a significant threat to human health. Animal models do not fully recapitulate human disease, necessitating advanced models to study human-fungal pathogen interactions. In this study, we utilized primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) to recapitulate the lung environment in vitro and investigate cellular responses to two diverse, clinically significant fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. To understand the mechanisms of early pathogenesis for both fungi, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of infected hAECs. Analysis revealed that both fungi induced cellular stress and cytokine production. However, the cell subtypes affected and specific pathways differed between fungi, with A. fumigatus and C. posadasii triggering protein-folding-related stress in ciliated cells and hypoxia responses in secretory cells, respectively. This study represents one of the first reports of single-cell transcriptional analysis of hAECs infected with either A. fumigatus or C. posadasii, providing a vital dataset to dissect the mechanism of disease and potentially identify targetable pathways. Importance Fungal infections in the lungs are dreaded complications for those with compromised immune systems and have limited treatment strategies available. These options are restricted further by the increased prevalence of treatment-resistant fungi. Many studies focus on how our immune systems respond to these pathogens, yet airway epithelial cells remain an understudied component of fungal infections in the lungs. Here, the authors provide a transcriptional analysis of primary human airway epithelial cells stimulated by two distinct fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. These data will enable further mechanistic studies of the contribution of the airway epithelium to initial host responses and represent a powerful new resource for investigators.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is characterized by a broad range of symptoms and disease trajectories. Understanding the correlation between clinical biomarkers and lung pathology during acute COVID-19 is necessary to understand its diverse pathogenesis and inform more effective treatments. Here, we present an integrated analysis of longitudinal clinical parameters, peripheral blood markers, and lung pathology in 142 Brazilian patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We identified core clinical and peripheral blood signatures differentiating disease progression between patients who recovered from severe disease compared with those who succumbed to the disease. Signatures were heterogeneous among fatal cases yet clustered into two patient groups: “early death” (<15 days until death) and “late death” (>15 days). Progression to early death was characterized systemically and in lung histopathological samples by rapid endothelial and myeloid activation and the presence of thrombi associated with SARS-CoV-2+ macrophages. In contrast, progression to late death was associated with fibrosis, apoptosis, and SARS-CoV-2+ epithelial cells in postmortem lung tissue. In late death cases, cytotoxicity, interferon, and T helper 17 (TH17) signatures were only detectable in the peripheral blood after 2 weeks of hospitalization. Progression to recovery was associated with higher lymphocyte counts, TH2 responses, and anti-inflammatory–mediated responses. By integrating antemortem longitudinal blood signatures and spatial single-cell lung signatures from postmortem lung samples, we defined clinical parameters that could be used to help predict COVID-19 outcomes. A single-cell lung atlas integrated with clinical and blood signatures can predict disease trajectories in COVID-19 progression. Editor’s summary A major challenge early during the COVID-19 pandemic was the inability to determine when a patient was going to recover or succumb to disease. Although vaccines, antivirals, and other therapeutics have limited the fatalities caused by COVID-19, the ability to predict disease progression remains important because it could help determine the best therapeutic approach for each patient. Here, Da Silva Filho et al. integrated antemortem peripheral blood analysis and clinical data with postmortem analysis of lung tissues to define signatures of recovery, early death, and late death from COVID-19. They then used these integrated signatures to identify peripheral blood and clinical parameters that could predict a patient’s trajectory. These data could be useful for anticipating a patient’s clinical course and for identifying personalized therapeutic approaches. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), often preceded by acute lung injury (ALI), is characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory fluid in the lung alveoli, leaky alveolar epithelium and endothelium, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This progression from ALI to ARDS is a major contributor to the high mortality observed in COVID-19 patients. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to lung ACE2 and, in addition to facilitating viral cell entry, it plays an important role in the development of ALI and ARDS, especially in the later phases of COVID-19 as well as long COVID. Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 4A3 is a key mediator of ARDS pathology. This study tested the hypothesis that targeting PTP4A3 would prevent COVID-19 associated ALI. Intratracheal administration of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Subunit 1 to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 elicited pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leaky alveoli, overexpression of cytokines, structural lung injury and lung dysfunction; all these symptoms were ameliorated by the selective, allosteric inhibitor of PTP4A3, KVX-053. These findings provide the first evidence supporting a role for PTP4A3 in the development of SARS-CoV-2- mediated ALI.

        <tr id="Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a neurotropic member of the genus Orthoflavivirus (former Flavivirus) and is of significant health concern in Europe and Asia. TBEV pathogenesis may occur directly via virus-induced damage to neurons or through immunopathology due to excessive inflammation. While primary cells isolated from the host can be used to study the immune response to TBEV, it is still unclear how well these reflect the immune response elicited in vivo. Here, we compared the transcriptional response to TBEV and the less pathogenic tick-borne flavivirus, Langat virus (LGTV), in primary monocultures of neurons, astrocytes and microglia in vitro, with the transcriptional response in vivo captured by single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of a whole mouse cortex. We detected similar transcriptional changes induced by both LGTV and TBEV infection in vitro, with the lower response to LGTV likely resulting from slower viral kinetics. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a stronger transcriptional response in vivo than in vitro for astrocytes and microglia, with a limited overlap mainly dominated by interferon signaling. Together, this adds to our understanding of neurotropic flavivirus pathogenesis and the strengths and limitations of available model systems.">

We identified peripheral MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations indicative of an enhanced migratory, proinflammatory, and activated CD8+ T cell phenotype, which was also evident in cotwins with SCNI and in an independent validation cohort of people with MS. Together, our in-depth single-cell analysis indicates a disease-driving proinflammatory role of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and identifies potential immunological and metabolic therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages of the disease.

        <tr id="Background Viral respiratory infections are a significant global health burden. Human immune responses to infections caused by respiratory viruses are complex and dependent on the length of time the host has been infected. Human viral challenge studies provide a useful opportunity to understand the timing of human immune responses as samples can be obtained pre-inoculation and post-inoculation by defined virus inocula. Transcriptomic data is available from a large amount of publicly available viral challenge studies and genome-wide transcriptomic data is primarily derived from bulk samples containing mixed cell subpopulations. Traditional bulk transcriptomic analysis methods often utilize deconvolution techniques to study changes in cell proportions of major immune cell types. Methods and Principal Findings In this study, we digitally sorted the cellular diversity of 31 blood immune cell types over time in human challenge studies after inoculation by H3N2 influenza virus H1N1 influenza virus, and RSV using xCell, a digital cell separation method, on human bulk transcriptional repository data. We identified common inoculation-induced changes in cell subpopulations across studies of the three viruses with time kinetics. We observed a consistent elevation of myeloid cells and their subtypes post-inoculation across various viral inoculations. Lymphocytes and their subpopulations were reduced in symptomatic and infected (Sx/Inf) participants compared to asymptomatic and uninfected (Asx/Uninf) participants. H3N2 evoked the earliest transcriptional immune responses, followed by H1N1, RSV infection elicited a delayed transcriptional response compared to both influenza viruses likely due to slower replication kinetics. Our analysis also revealed unique immune cell composition changes caused by specific viruses. We found that pre-existing baseline memory T cells were associated with resistance to influenza viral infection and that the key cell type is effector memory (Tem) CD8 T cells. Conclusion These findings identify specific target cell subpopulations which respond to respiratory virus inoculation over time, shedding light on mechanisms for eliciting a robust baseline level of immune memory against multiple viral strains. These studies highlight potential immune cell responses that can be utilized to enhance vaccine design.">

        <tr id="A severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifests as systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement is called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). This review examines the possible relationship between gut barrier integrity, the microbiome, dysregulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling, and MIS-C. Clinical and biochemical features of MIS-C are comparable to those of other hyper-inflammatory syndromes, suggesting a dysregulated immune response. One possible explanation for the systemic inflammation seen in MIS-C patients is the SARS-CoV-2-induced dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathway. In addition, new data suggest a reciprocal link between gut barrier integrity and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits bacteriophage-like behavior, highlighting the role of bacteria as a reservoir for the virus and emphasizing the importance of understanding the bacteriophagic mechanism of the virus in fecal–oral transmission. The increased translocation of viral products and bacterial toxins may result from disrupting the intestinal barrier and cause systemic inflammation. On the other hand, systemic inflammation can weaken the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which feeds back into the loop of immunological dysregulation. In the context of MIS-C, understanding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection, IL-6, and gut barrier integrity may shed light on the etiology of the disease and guide treatment options. Since children with gut dysbiosis may be more susceptible to MIS-C, it is critical to reinforce their microbiome through probiotics supplementation, and plant-fiber-rich diets (prebiotics). Early antibiotic treatment and the use of zonulin antagonists should also be considered.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 remains a significant threat, particularly to vulnerable populations. The emergence of new variants necessitates the development of treatments and vaccines that induce both humoral and cellular immunity. This study aimed to identify potentially immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides and to explore the intricate host–pathogen interactions involving peripheral immune responses, memory profiles, and various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Using in silico and experimental methods, we identified several CD8-restricted SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are either poorly studied or have previously unreported immunogenicity: fifteen from the Spike and three each from non-structural proteins Nsp1-2-3-16. A Spike peptide, LA-9, demonstrated a 57% response rate in ELISpot assays using PBMCs from 14 HLA-A*02:01 positive, vaccinated, and mild-COVID-19 recovered subjects, indicating its potential for diagnostics, research, and multi-epitope vaccine platforms. We also found that younger individuals, with fewer vaccine doses and longer intervals since infection, showed lower anti-Spike (ELISA) and anti-Wuhan neutralizing antibodies (pseudovirus assay), higher naïve T cells, and lower central memory, effector memory, and CD4hiCD8low T cells (flow cytometry) compared to older subjects. In our cohort, a higher prevalence of Vδ2-γδ and DN T cells, and fewer naïve CD8 T cells, seemed to correlate with strong cellular and lower anti-NP antibody responses and to associate with Omicron infection, absence of confusional state, and habitual sporting activity.">

We meticulously describe the cardiovascular outcomes in five patients, encompassing a range of severe conditions such as sudden cardiac death during exercise, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, acute inferior myocardial infarction, and acute myocarditis. All five patients were diagnosed with myocarditis, confirmed through endomyocardial biopsy and histochemical staining, which identified inflammatory cell infiltration in their heart tissue. Crucially, electron microscopy revealed widespread mitochondrial vacuolations and the presence of myofilament degradation within the cardiomyocytes of these patients. These findings were mirrored in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, suggesting a potential underlying cellular mechanism for the cardiac effects associated with Long COVID. Our report sheds light on the cardiovascular implications of Long COVID and underscores the importance of further research to understand its cellular underpinnings.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality. One Sentence Summary: TRPV1+ neurons facilitate host survival from influenza A virus infection by controlling myeloid cell responses and immunopathology.">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism and mechanisms implicated in cardiac damage in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was completely restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible. Author Summary Mosquito-borne viruses, such as those within the alphavirus genus, are an ongoing concern to human health globally. While we have recently begun to explore the mechanisms of CHIKV-induced pathology in the heart, little is known about other arboviruses and alphaviruses related to CHIKV. Here, we identified that multiple cardiac cell types are susceptible to infection by several arboviruses important to public health. Specifically, we noted differences in how two related viruses, CHIKV and MAYV, infect endothelial cells from multiple origins. This work highlights the potential for other emerging arboviruses, in addition to CHIKV, to directly infect cardiac tissue. Moreover, it emphasizes the ability for MAYV, an emerging virus that is less studied, to infect various endothelial cell types to high titers, suggesting the need for further research on MAYV pathogenesis. Finally, this research identifies differences in infection between individual strains of CHIKV, suggesting a finely tuned mechanism of restriction in endothelial cells that can be further explored, as well as the need to study use different viral strains for future alphavirus research.">

        <tr id="In central nervous system (CNS) diseases characterized by late-onset neurodegeneration, the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

Many pneumonia outbreaks have occurred in local areas and even in the world. Since the end of 2019, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has once again attracted the world's attention to viral pneumonia. At present, a large number of basic research, drug development and clinical trials are being carried out for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. However, patients are generally given symptomatic and supportive treatment, antiviral therapy, immunotherapy, glucocorticoid therapy and respiratory support. Therefore, finding new and effective treatment methods based on the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still the current practical demand and research focus. This review focuses on the occurrence and development of CS and the immunopathological damage caused by CS in viral pneumonia, especially in severe pneumonia, and summarizes the potential means of treating CS through IL-related pathways. Research found that different viruses cause CS, cytokines involved in the type and severity of differences, therefore, should also be targeted in the treatment strategy. In addition, in addition to focusing on the treatment of CS, in order to better study the pathophysiological mechanism of virus-induced CS and screen intervention drugs efficiently, how to safely and effectively establish cell and animal models of CS and improve the scientific evaluation system are also key issues worthy of attention.">

        <tr id="Long COVID is a complex condition where symptoms persist for more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and affects an estimated 5-30% of individuals. While the pathobiology of long COVID is still evolving, persistent inflammation has emerged as an important feature of this condition. However, it is unclear if immune responses from COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 re-infection exacerbate or mirror the initial inflammatory responses. To address this question, we quantified 182 inflammatory and neurology-related proteins in plasma using multiplexed affinity proteomics. Plasma samples were collected 6-9 months after first infection, but before COVID-19 vaccination from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 (n=21) or from individuals with long COVID (n=12). This was benchmarked against plasma from unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals (n=24). In addition to this cross-sectional analysis, we performed longitudinal analysis in a subset of individuals (n=34), where paired samples collected 2-4 weeks after a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and after SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection were available. Boruta feature selection and lasso regression models identified a distinct plasma profile in long COVID individuals, characterised by elevated IL-20, HAGH, NAAA, CLEC10A, LXN, and MCP-1 and reduced TRAIL, G-CSF, NBL1, and CCL23 protein concentrations. Notably, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that neither COVID-19 booster vaccination nor breakthrough infection replicated inflammatory and neurology-related plasma protein profiles observed after primary infection suggesting an altered immune response outcome in individuals with long COVID upon re-exposure.">

        <tr id="Long COVID, or Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), was characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive impairments. These symptoms, emerging one to 2 months post-infection and persisting for several months, cannot be attributed to other diagnoses. The pathophysiology of long COVID remained elusive; however, emerging studies suggested multiple potential mechanisms, including the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus, persistent SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs, neuroinflammation, and vascular damage, which may contribute to its development. Long COVID affected multiple organ systems, including respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems, leading to a range of functional impairments. Additionally, it showed a profound impact on mental health, manifesting as anxiety and depression, which significantly degraded the quality of life. The absence of definitive treatments underscored the importance of prevention. Recent evidence indicated that early antiviral intervention—particularly with small-molecule drugs such as Metformin, Ensitrelvir, Molnupiravir, and Nirmatrelvir—may effectively reduce the incidence of long COVID. This underscored the promising role of small-molecule compounds in mitigating long-term COVID-19 consequences, offering a novel preventive strategy against long COVID and its extensive impacts on patients.">

        <tr id="Long-lasting COVID-19 (long COVID) diseases constitute a real life-changing burden for many patients around the globe and, overall, can be considered societal and economic issues. They include a variety of symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of smell (anosmia), and neurological–cognitive sequelae, such as memory loss, anxiety, brain fog, acute encephalitis, and stroke, collectively called long neuro-COVID-19 (long neuro-COVID). They also include cardiopulmonary sequelae, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary damage, fibrosis, gastrointestinal dysregulation, renal failure, and vascular endothelial dysregulation, and the onset of new diabetes, with each symptom usually being treated individually. The main unmet challenge is to understand the mechanisms of the pathophysiologic sequelae, in particular the neurological symptoms. This mini-review presents the main mechanistic hypotheses considered to explain the multiple long neuro-COVID symptoms, namely immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation, persistent viral reservoirs, vascular and endothelial dysfunction, and the disruption of the neurotransmitter signaling along various paths. We suggest that the nucleoprotein N of SARS-CoV-2 constitutes a “hub” between the virus and the host inflammation, immunity, and neurotransmission.">

        <tr id="Rationale The lung is a unique immunological niche with diverse immune cell types. The effects of stimulation through innate and adaptive immune receptors on human lung immune cells has largely been extrapolated from studies of blood immune cells. While multiple immune cell types and many genes have been implicated as contributing to asthma, the dynamics of these in human lung immune cells following activation will yield insights into asthma pathogenesis and lung immunity more broadly. Methods and Measurements Human lung immune cells from 6 donors were isolated. Mixed leukocytes were treated separately with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), F(ab’)2-anti-human-IgM/IgG + IL4 and anti-CD3/CD28 for 4 and 18 hours and underwent single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Lung immune cell types were annotated, and gene expression compared across conditions. Genes at prior asthma-associated genetic loci were characterized across cell types, treatments and timepoints. Expression of non-classical class II genes associated with asthma, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2, and their protein products was characterized with immunohistochemistry. Main Results We characterized gene expression in 116,697 lung immune cells. Cell-, treatment-, and timepoint-specific effects on gene expression were detected in all lung immune cell populations. Correlation of gene expression between lung and blood lymphocyte populations decreased following stimulation. Among the genes that were differentially expressed, 97 receptor:ligand pairs had changes with treatments. 96.0% of genes at asthma risk loci demonstrated differential expression in at least one cell type and at least one treatment. B cells were the cell type with the highest expression of HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 which increased with anti-IgM/IgG treatment and the HLA-DQβ2 protein was identified in lung B cells from a donor with asthma. Conclusions Human lung immune activation elicits a broad range of cellular responses that deviate from those of blood immune cells and are relevant to asthma. Lung B cells expressing HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 appear to be involved in a novel antigen presentation pathway that contributes to asthma risk.">

        <tr id="Aging is physiologically associated with a decline in the function of the immune system and subsequent susceptibility to infections. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key element in the activation of cellular immunity, plays an important role in defense against virus infections. Decreased levels of IFN-γ in the elderly may explain their increased risk for viral infectious diseases such as COVID-19. There is accumulating evidence that ascorbic acid (vitamin C [VitC]) and α-tocopherol together help improve the function of the immune system in the elderly, control infections, and decrease the treatment duration. A SARS-CoV-2 strain was isolated from a patient and then cultured in the Vero cell line. The isolated and propagated virus was then inactivated using formalin and purified by the column chromatography. The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was formulated in the Alum adjuvant combined with VitC or α-tocopherol and/or both of them. The vaccines were injected twice to young and aged C57BL/6 mice. Two weeks later, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-2 cytokines were assessed using ELISA Kits. Specific IgG and IgG1/IgG2a were assessed by an in-house ELISA. In addition, the expression of PD1 and TERT genes in the spleen tissue of the mice was measured using real-time PCR. IL-4 and IFN-γ cytokines showed a significant increase in both aged and young mice compared with the Alum-based vaccine. In addition, our results exhibited a significant decrease and increase in specific total IgG and the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, respectively. Furthermore, the vaccine formulated in α-tocopherol + VitC led to decreased PD1 and increased TERT gene expression levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that α-tocopherol + VitC formulated in the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine led to a shift toward Th1, which may be due to their effect on the physiology of cells, especially aged ones and changing their phenotype toward young cells.">

        <tr id="Neutralizing antibody responses correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet higher neutralizing responses associate with more severe disease. Whether people without severe disease can also develop strong neutralizing responses to infection, and the pathways involved, is less clear. We performed a proteomic analysis on sera from 71 individuals infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, enrolled during the first South African infection wave. We determined disease severity by whether participants required supplemental oxygen and measured neutralizing antibody levels at convalescence. High neutralizing antibodies were associated with high disease severity, yet 40% of participants with lower disease severity had neutralizing antibody levels comparable to those with severe disease. We found 130 differentially expressed proteins between high and low neutralizers and 40 between people with high versus low disease severity. Five proteins overlapped, including furin, a protease which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. High neutralizers with non-severe disease had similar levels of differentially expressed neutralization response proteins to high neutralizers with severe disease, yet similar levels of differentially expressed disease severity proteins to participants with non-severe disease. Furthermore, we could reasonably predict who developed a strong neutralizing response based on a single protein, HSPA8, involved in clathrin pit uncoating. These results indicate that a strong antibody response does not always require severe disease and may involve different pathways.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, can be reconstituted by surrogate cells - a process termed “microglia replacement.” To expand the microglia replacement toolkit, we here introduce estrogen-regulated (ER) homeobox B8 (Hoxb8) conditionally immortalized macrophages, a cell model for generation of immune cells from murine bone marrow, as a versatile model for microglia replacement. We find that ER-Hoxb8 macrophages are highly comparable to primary bone marrow-derived (BMD) macrophages in vitro, and, when transplanted into a microglia-free brain, engraft the parenchyma and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Furthermore, ER-Hoxb8 progenitors are readily transducible by virus and easily stored as stable, genetically manipulated cell lines. As a demonstration of this system’s power for studying the effects of disease mutations on microglia in vivo, we created stable, Adar1-mutated ER-Hoxb8 lines using CRISPR-Cas9 to study the intrinsic contribution of macrophages to Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS), an inherited interferonopathy that primarily affects the brain and immune system. We find that Adar1 knockout elicited interferon secretion and impaired macrophage production in vitro, while preventing brain macrophage engraftment in vivo - phenotypes that can be rescued with concurrent mutation of Ifih1 (MDA5) in vitro, but not in vivo. Lastly, we extended these findings by generating ER-Hoxb8 progenitors from mice harboring a patient-specific Adar1 mutation (D1113H). We demonstrated the ability of microglia-specific D1113H mutation to drive interferon production in vivo, suggesting microglia drive AGS neuropathology. In sum, we introduce the ER-Hoxb8 approach to model microglia replacement and use it to clarify macrophage contributions to AGS.">

Emerging evidence implicates Cathepsin L (CTSL) in diabetic complications, including nephropathy and retinopathy. Our previous research identified CTSL as a pivotal protease promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate elevated blood CTSL levels in individuals with diabetes, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia correlates positively with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients, while acute hyperglycemia augments CTSL activity in healthy individuals. In vitro studies reveal high glucose, but not insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells, with CTSL knockout cells displaying reduced susceptibility. Utilizing lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, alongside Leprdb/dbmice and Leprdb/+mice, we illustrate increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation in diabetic comorbidities and complications.">

        <tr id="Most COVID-19 patients have a positive prognosis, but patients with additional underlying diseases are more likely to have severe illness and increased fatality rates. Numerous studies indicate that cancer patients are more prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19 or even dying. In the recent transcriptome investigations, it is demonstrated that the fructose metabolism is altered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, cancer cells can use fructose as an extra source of energy for growth and metastasis. Furthermore, enhanced living conditions have resulted in a notable rise in fructose consumption in individuals’ daily dietary habits. We therefore hypothesize that the poor prognosis of cancer patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 may therefore be mediated through fructose metabolism. Using CRC cases from four distinct cohorts, we built and validated a predictive model based on SARS-CoV-2 producing fructose metabolic anomalies by coupling Cox univariate regression and lasso regression feature selection algorithms to identify hallmark genes in colorectal cancer. We also developed a composite prognostic nomogram to improve clinical practice by integrating the characteristics of aberrant fructose metabolism produced by this novel coronavirus with age and tumor stage. To obtain the genes with the greatest potential prognostic values, LASSO regression analysis was performed, In the TCGA training cohort, patients were randomly separated into training and validation sets in the ratio of 4: 1, and the best risk score value for each sample was acquired by lasso regression analysis for further analysis, and the fifteen genes CLEC4A, FDFT1, CTNNB1, GPI, PMM2, PTPRD, IL7, ALDH3B1, AASS, AOC3, SEPINE1, PFKFB1, FTCD, TIMP1 and GATM were finally selected. In order to validate the model’s accuracy, ROC curve analysis was performed on an external dataset, and the results indicated that the model had a high predictive power for the prognosis prediction of patients. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the future targeted regulation of fructose metabolism in colorectal cancer patients, while simultaneously optimizing dietary guidance and therapeutic care for colorectal cancer patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="The pathophysiological mechanisms of the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) remain unclear. Sex differences not only exist in the disease severity of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but also in the risk of suffering from PASC. Women have a higher risk of suffering from PASC and a longer time to resolution than men. To explore the possible immune mechanisms of PASC among non-elderly females, we mined single-cell transcriptome data from peripheral blood samples of non-elderly female patients with PASC and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with age- and gender-matched non-PASC and healthy controls available from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. By comparing the differences, we found that a CD14+ monocyte subset characterized by higher expression of signal transducers and activators of transcription 2 (STAT2) (CD14+STAT2high) was notably increased in the PASC patients compared with the non-PASC individuals. The transcriptional factor (TF) activity analysis revealed that STAT2 and IRF9 were the key TFs determining the function of CD14+STAT2high monocytes. STAT2 and IRF9 are TFs exclusively involving type I and III interferon (IFN) signaling pathways, resulting in uncontrolled IFN-I signaling activation and type I interferonopathy. Furthermore, increased expression of common interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) has also been identified in most monocyte subsets among the non-elderly female PASC patients, including IFI6, IFITM3, IFI44L, IFI44, EPSTI1, ISG15, and MX1. This study reveals a featured CD14+STAT2high monocyte associated with uncontrolled IFN-I signaling activation, which is indicative of a possible type I interferonopathy in the non-elderly female patients with PASC.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by chronic inflammation and damage to the central nervous system, and substantial characterization of molecular signatures of glial and immune cells in the disease has been conducted. However, comparatively less well characterized is the molecular signature of pathologically inflamed neurons. Here, we accessed multi-omic high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic data to investigate the molecular signature of neurons from progressive MS patients and from mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results indicate a shared and consistent neuronal gene expression signature in MS and EAE samples including a notable upregulation of immune system related genes and processes. Analysis of immune-enriched pathways in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and motor neurons from mice subjected to EAE revealed enrichment for the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway and interferon response genes in both types of neurons, and ATAC-seq analysis confirmed the accessibility of these genes. Parallel analyses of neurons from MS patients identified a signature of 48 commonly upregulated immune genes in neurons. Prediction of transcriptional regulators of these genes identified key upstream regulators including signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon response factor 5 (IRF5), highly involved in immune-related processes, with significant gene expression changes in both RGCs and motor neurons. Protein-protein interaction analyses among the transcriptional regulators unveiled intricate interactions among transcription factors, especially from the IRF and STAT families, suggesting their importance in regulating immune gene expression in inflamed neurons. Small molecule inhibition of IRF5 in inflamed neurons in vitro promoted cell survival and reduced the expression of the immune gene signature, supporting the biological relevance of IRF5 in mediating the neuronal inflammatory response. Together, this study identifies regulated immune processes in neurons from EAE mice and from MS patient samples suggesting potential roles for neuronal immune molecules in disease progression, as revealed by transcriptomic, epigenomic, and experimental approaches. Further, the results strongly implicate active interferon signaling in neurons driving immune related changes in gene expression through IRF5 and STAT1 transcription factor activity, potentially impacting downstream neuronal survival through IRF5 activity.">

        <tr id="Immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet the demands associated with immune responses. The effects of aging on these pathways and on the metabolic phenotype of the immune cells participating in antibody responses to vaccines are still largely unknown. Here we used a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 that utilizes the cellular heat shock chaperone glycoprotein 96 (gp96), engineered to co-express SARS-CoV-2 Spike (spike) protein (gp96-Ig-S). Results show that this vaccine induces comparable B cell primary responses in young and old mice at later time points, but a significantly lesser secondary response in old as compared to young mice, with the antibodies generated in the secondary response being also of lower avidity. This occurs because aging changes the B cell metabolic phenotype and induces hyper-metabolic B cells that are associated with higher intrinsic inflammation and decreased protective antibody responses. However, the gp96-Ig-S vaccine was found to be effective in significantly reducing the metabolic/inflammatory status of B cells from old mice, suggesting the possibility that targeting metabolic pathways may improve immune function in old mice that do not respond adequately to the vaccine.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives: The study aims to explore the potential for transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2, focusing on its pathophysiology, placental defense mechanisms, and the clinical implications for maternal and neonatal health. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive review of the current literature was conducted, analyzing studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, the expression of key viral receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in placental cells, and the immune responses involved in placental defense. The review also examined the clinical outcomes related to maternal and neonatal health, including adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. Results: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the placenta supports the biological plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 transplacental transmission. Histopathological findings from the infected placentas reveal inflammation, vascular changes, and the evidence of viral particles in placental tissues. Clinical reports indicate an increased risk of preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and neonatal infection in pregnancies affected by COVID-19. However, the frequency and mechanisms of vertical transmission remain variable across studies, highlighting the need for standardized research protocols. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 can potentially infect placental cells, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. While evidence of transplacental transmission has been documented, the risk and mechanisms are not fully understood. Ongoing research is essential to clarify these aspects and inform obstetric care practices to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is one of the most prevalent respiratory pathogens in horses with a high impact on animal health worldwide. Entry of the virus into epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and rapid local viral replication is followed by infection of local lymphoid tissues leading to cell-associated viremia and disease progression. Pre-existing mucosal immunity has previously been shown to reduce viral shedding and prevent viremia, consequently limiting severe disease manifestations. Here, nasopharyngeal transcriptomic profiling was used to identify differentially expressed genes following EHV-1 challenge in horses with different EHV-1 immune statuses. Immune horses (n = 4) did neither develop clinical disease nor viremia and did not shed virus after experimental infection, while non-immune horses (n = 4) did all the above. RNA sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal samples pre- and 24 hours post-infection (24hpi). At 24hpi, 109 and 44 genes were upregulated in immune horses and non-immune horses, respectively, and three genes were explored in further detail. Antileukoproteinase (SLPI) gene expression increased 2.1-fold within 24 hours in immune horses in concert with protein secretion. Interferon (IFN)-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) and 3 (IFIT3) were upregulated in non-immune horses, corresponding with nasal IFN-α secretion and viral replication. By contrast, neither IFIT expression nor IFN-α secretion was induced by EHV-1 infection of immune horses. Transcriptomic profiling offered a tool to identify, for the first time, the role of SLPI in innate immunity against EHV-1, and further emphasized the central role of the type I IFN response in the anti-viral defense of non-immune horses. IMPORTANCE Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) remains a considerable concern in the equine industry, with yearly outbreaks resulting in morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. In addition to its importance in equine health, EHV-1 is a respiratory pathogen and an alphaherpesvirus, and it may serve as a model for other viruses with similar pathogenicity or phylogeny. Large animal models allow the collection of high-volume samples longitudinally, permitting in-depth investigation of immunological processes. This study was performed on bio-banked nasopharyngeal samples from an EHV-1 infection experiment, where clinical outcomes had previously been determined. Matched nucleic acid and protein samples throughout infection permitted longitudinal quantification of the protein or related proteins of selected differentially expressed genes detected during the transcriptomic screen. The results of this manuscript identified novel innate immune pathways of the upper respiratory tract during the first 24 hours of EHV-1 infection, offering a first look at the components of early mucosal immunity that are indicative of protection.">

        <tr id="Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis and HIV-1 co-infection worsens the already poor prognosis. How Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the influence of HIV-1 on pathogenesis remains unclear. Using human pericytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia alone; and combined in an in vitro BBB we investigated Mtb +/− HIV-1 co-infection on central nervous system cell entry and function. Mtb infected and multiplied in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. The permeability of the BBB increased resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects included increased markers of cellular stress, ROS release, the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes, and increased secretion of neuroexcitotoxic glutamate. Distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators were observed. These data indicate Mtb can translocate the BBB directly to initiate meningitis.">

        <tr id="The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and enduring impact, resulting in substantial loss of life. The scientific community has responded unprecedentedly by investigating various aspects of the crisis, particularly focusing on the acute phase of COVID-19. The roles of the viral load, cytokines, and chemokines during the acute phase and in the context of patients who experienced enduring symptoms upon infection, so called Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 or PASC, have been studied extensively. Here, in this review, we offer a virologist’s perspective on PASC, highlighting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, cytokines, and chemokines in different organs of patients across the full clinical spectrum of acute-phase disease. We underline that the probability of severe or critical disease progression correlates with increased viral load levels detected in the upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT), and plasma. Acute-phase viremia is a clear, although not unambiguous, predictor of PASC development. Moreover, both the quantity and diversity of functions of cytokines and chemokines increase with acute-phase disease severity. Specific cytokines remain or become elevated in the PASC phase, although the driving factor of ongoing inflammation found in patients with PASC remains to be investigated. The key findings highlighted in this review contribute to a further understanding of PASC and their differences and overlap with acute disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes a persistent infection in sensory ganglia. The infection manifests itself as genital herpes but in rare cases it can cause meningitis. In this study, we used a murine model of HSV-2 meningitis to show that Fas and FasL are induced within the CNS upon HSV-2 infection, both on resident microglia and astrocytes and on infiltrating monocytes and lymphocytes. Mice lacking Fas or FasL had a more severe disease development with significantly higher morbidity, mortality, and an overall higher CNS viral load. In parallel, these Fas/FasL-deficient mice showed a severely impaired infection-induced CNS inflammatory response with lower levels of infiltrating CD4+ T-cells, lower levels of Th1 cytokines and chemokines, and a shift in the balance between M1 and M2 microglia/monocytes. In vitro, we confirmed that Fas and FasL is required for the induction of leucocyte apoptosis, but also show that the Fas/FasL pathway is required for adequate cytokine and chemokine production by glial cells. In summary, our data show that the Fas/FasL cell death receptor pathway is an important defense mechanism in the spinal cord as it down-regulates HSV-2-induced inflammation while at the same time promoting adequate anti-viral immune responses against infection.">

        <tr id="The development of the human immune system lasts for several years after birth. The impact of this maturation phase on the quality of adaptive immunity and the acquisition of immunological memory after infection at a young age remains incompletely defined. Here, using an antigen-reactive T cell (ARTE) assay and multidimensional flow cytometry, we profiled circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–reactive CD3+CD4+CD154+ T cells in children and adults before infection, during infection, and 11 months after infection, stratifying children into separate age groups and adults according to disease severity. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, children younger than 5 years old displayed a lower antiviral CD4+ T cell response, whereas children older than 5 years and adults with mild disease had, quantitatively and phenotypically, comparable virus-reactive CD4+ T cell responses. Adults with severe disease mounted a response characterized by higher frequencies of virus-reactive proinflammatory and cytotoxic T cells. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, preschool-age children not only maintained neutralizing SARS-CoV-2–reactive antibodies postinfection comparable to adults but also had phenotypically distinct memory T cells displaying high inflammatory features and properties associated with migration toward inflamed sites. Moreover, preschool-age children had markedly fewer circulating virus-reactive memory B cells compared with the other cohorts. Collectively, our results reveal unique facets of antiviral immunity in humans at a young age and indicate that the maturation of adaptive responses against SARS-CoV-2 toward an adult-like profile occurs in a progressive manner. Preschool-age children mount a different adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 than adults. Editor’s summary The immune system continues to develop throughout childhood, and it is established that children have distinct immune responses to vaccines and infections as compared with adults. Here, Manfroi et al. characterized the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children. The authors found that preschool-age children had a different adaptive immune response, with a lower frequency of antiviral CD4+ T cells, compared with older children and adults; this younger cohort also developed phenotypically distinct memory T and B cell responses after recovery compared with the other cohorts. This study highlights that responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in young children are unique and reflect the ongoing maturation of the immune system into adulthood. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="Background: Studies have reported that 5hmC features in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could serve as early warning biomarkers for the occurrence and progression of COVID-19, as well as myocardial injury. However, its roles in the occurrence and progression of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) following COVID-19 infection has not been fully studied. Methods: Firstly, we used the 5hmC-Seal technique to obtain genome-wide 5hmC profiles from plasma cfDNA of 24 ACS2N patients (individuals experiencing ACS onset within 2 months after COVID-19 infection), 28 ACS2W patients (individuals experiencing ACS onset beyond 2 months after COVID-19 infection), and 16 ACS patients (patients with ACS without COVID-19 infection). Secondly, we performed GO, KEGG analysis on the differentially expressed genes and identified a series of immune and inflammation related genes. Thirdly, the distribution of immune cells in different groups of patients was studied by immune infiltration analysis. Finally, we performed PPI network analysis on these genes to identify potential key target genes. Results: In this study, we firstly found that there was a significant difference in 5hmC levels between ACS2N patients and ACS patients, while the difference between ACS2W and ACS was not significant. Secondly, it was found that neutrophils were abnormally activated in the ACS2N group. Finally, a target gene phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) was found to be highly expressed in the ACS2N group by PPI network analysis of the differential genes and validated with external datasets. Conclusions: Our study suggested that 5hmC markers extracted from plasma cfDNA could differentiate between ACS2N and ACS patients. In addition, we observed that neutrophils exhibited abnormal activation in ACS2N patients. Further analysis showed that COVID-19 infection may affect the occurrence and development of ACS by abnormally up-regulating PDE4D gene expression.">

        <tr id="Although the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), primarily manifests as severe respiratory distress, its impact on the cardiovascular system is also notable. Studies reveal that COVID-19 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID-19 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely under-reviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID-19 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains an international health problem caused by the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of May 2024, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths globally. Despite current vaccination programs, infections are still rapidly increasing, mainly due to the appearance and spread of new variants, variations in immunization rates, and limitations of current vaccines in preventing transmission. This underscores the need for pan-variant antivirals and treatments. The interferon (IFN) system is a critical element of the innate immune response and serves as a frontline defense against viruses. It induces a generalized antiviral state by transiently upregulating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To gain a deeper comprehension of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, its connection to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and the potential therapeutic implications, this review provides a detailed overview of fundamental aspects of the diverse ISGs identified for their antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. It emphasizes the importance of these proteins in controlling viral replication and spread. Furthermore, we explore methodological approaches for the identification of ISGs and conduct a comparative analysis with other viruses. Deciphering the roles of ISGs and their interactions with viral pathogens can help identify novel targets for antiviral therapies and enhance our preparedness to confront current and future viral threats.">

        <tr id="Mitochondria play pivotal roles in sustaining various biological functions including energy metabolism, cellular signaling transduction, and innate immune responses. Viruses exploit cellular metabolic synthesis to facilitate viral replication, potentially disrupting mitochondrial functions and subsequently eliciting a cascade of proinflammatory responses in host cells. Additionally, the disruption of mitochondrial membranes is involved in immune regulation. During viral infections, mitochondria orchestrate innate immune responses through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of mitochondrial DNA, which serves as an effective defense mechanism against virus invasion. The targeting of mitochondrial damage may represent a novel approach to antiviral intervention. This review summarizes the regulatory mechanism underlying proinflammatory response induced by mitochondrial damage during viral infections, providing new insights for antiviral strategies.">

        <tr id="Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common major complication of preterm birth. Supplemental oxygen administration, while lifesaving in the neonatal period, remains a key determinant of BPD pathophysiology. Exposure of the immature lung to increased levels of oxygen elicits an inflammatory response resulting in abnormal lung development. However, not every premature infant is equally sensitive to develop BPD. Using genetically diverse mouse strains, we show that the innate immune response activated in the lungs of mice sensitive to hyperoxia that develop BPD-like lung injury differs from mice resilient to disease. Specifically, we identified a selective upregulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) on lung macrophages and monocytes in the hyperoxia-sensitive C57BL/6J mouse strain. We show that loss of function of TREM2 signaling in myeloid cells resulted in a dramatically improved phenotype after neonatal hyperoxia exposure characterized by a dampened immune response, preserved alveolar structure, and preserved cell proliferative potential supporting normal lung development. At the molecular level, inhibition of TREM2 signaling dampened the magnitude of p53 activation and resulted in cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. These findings show that TREM2 is a critical regulator of the pathogenic innate immune response to hyperoxia and highlight its importance as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating injury in the hyperoxia-exposed developing lung.">

AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of trained immunity by reprogramming hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow generating trained innate cells with enhanced responsiveness. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung via neutrophils and IFNγ signalling, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (LPS) or viral (polyI:C) challenges. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.">

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often causes coagulation disorders that affect highly vascularized organs, such as the lungs and kidneys.

Objective
The objective of this study was to report the histopathological findings of variations in the fibrin pattern of pulmonary and renal microthrombi in patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
Minimally invasive autopsies were performed on 40 patients to collect lung (n=40) and kidney (n=16) tissue samples. Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining techniques were used for histopathological analyses. Premortem laboratory data were obtained from the patients' electronic medical records.

Results
The lung tissue showed a patchy pattern, characterized by areas of both minimal and severe damage. The most significant histopathological finding was the detection of thrombi with fibrin structures organized into discrete star-shaped units, which were more frequently observed in areas with severe lung injury than in those with minimal lung injury (p = 0.012). Star-shaped fibrin structures were also observed in the renal glomerular capillaries. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of platelets and the procoagulant proteins von Willebrand factor (VWF) and Factor VIII within the star-shaped fibrin thrombi. Patients with star-shaped fibrin thrombi had higher levels of the systemic inflammatory indicators C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).

Conclusion
Our observations suggest that the inflammatory microenvironment resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to the formation of star-shaped fibrin units in the pulmonary and renal microthrombi.">

        <tr id="IL-26 is a key mediator of pulmonary host defense given its abundant expression in human airways and its established antibacterial properties. Moreover, recent studies indicate that IL-26 can also inhibit viral replication. Along these lines, we have previously reported an increase in the plasma concentration of IL-26 among patients with acute COVID-19 that is linked to harmful hyperinflammation. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether this systemic increase in IL-26 relates to disease severity, sex, comorbidities, viral load, or the innate immune response in acute COVID-19.IL-26 was quantified using ELISA in plasma samples from a large cohort of well-characterized patients with acute COVID-19 (n=178) and healthy controls (n=30). The plasma concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike protein, as well as those of IFN-α2a, IFN-β, and IFN-γ, were determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The concentration of double-stranded DNA was determined using fluorometry.The plasma concentration of IL-26 was increased in patients with severe/critical COVID-19, particularly among males and patients with comorbid obstructive lung disease. Moreover, the concentration of IL-26 displayed positive correlations with length of hospital stay, as well as with systemic markers of viral load, antiviral immunity, and extracellular DNA.Systemic IL-26 is involved in severe COVID-19, especially in males and patients with comorbid obstructive lung disease.

        <tr id="Background/Rationale We investigated the effect of pre-existing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human coronaviruses on infection outcomes in Omicron BA1/2 exposed household members from January to March 2022. Methods Data from a prospective household study in the Netherlands were used including 63 households with 195 household members exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA1/2 index case. The protocol included repeated nose-throat swab and saliva RT-PCR testing, paired serology, and self-reported daily symptom scoring by household members. Infection outcomes included the occurrence of secondary infections, symptom severity, and CT-value trajectories. We studied the effect of baseline binding antibody levels for SARS-CoVs and seasonal coronaviruses (hCoV) NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43 spike protein, on SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Results 132 of 195 (68%) exposed household members developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among exposed household members, higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 and beta hCoV antibodies (HKU1 and OC43) at baseline, were associated with a reduced risk of secondary infection (adjusted Odds ratio 0.61; 95% Confidence interval 0.44-0.84 and aOR 0.72; 95%CI 0.56-0.92, respectively). No significant differences between antibody levels and symptom burden or CT-value trajectories were observed. Conclusions Our study suggests that prior SARS-CoV-2 and beta hCoV antibodies provide some protection against Omicron BA.1/BA.2 infection, while effects on symptom burden or CT-value could not be demonstrated. The results highlight the relatively limited, but not negligible role of cross-protective antibodies, especially when facing immune escape variants of SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Background: A complement imbalance in lung alveolar tissue can play a deteriorating role in COVID-19, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CD55 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that inhibits the activation of the complement system at the intermediate cascade level, blocking the activity of the C3 convertase. Objective: In our study, lung specimens from COVID-19 and ARDS-positive COVID+/ARDS+ patients were compared with COVID-19 and ARDS-negative COVID–/ARDS– as well as COVID–/ARDS+ patients. Methods: Histochemical staining and immunolabeling of CD55 protein were performed. Results: The COVID–/ARDS– specimen showed higher expression and homogeneous distribution of glycosaminoglycans as well as compactly arranged elastic and collagen fibers of the alveolar walls in comparison to ARDS-affected lungs. In addition, COVID–/ARDS– lung tissues revealed stronger and homogenously distributed CD55 expression on the alveolar walls in comparison to the disrupted COVID–/ARDS+ lung tissues. Conclusions: Even though the collapse of the alveolar linings and the accumulation of cellular components in the alveolar spaces were characteristic of COVID+/ARDS+ lung tissues, evaluating CD55 expression could be relevant to understand its relation to the disease. Furthermore, targeting CD55 upregulation as a potential therapy could be an option for post-infectious complications of COVID-19 and other inflammatory lung diseases in the future.">

        <tr id="As obligate parasites, viruses need to hijack resources from infected cells to complete their lifecycle. The interaction between the virus and host determines the viral infection process, including viral propagation and the disease’s outcome. Understanding the interaction between the virus and host factors is a basis for unraveling the intricate biological processes in the infected cells and thereby developing more efficient and targeted antivirals. Among the various fundamental virus–host interactions, autophagy plays vital and also complicated roles by directly engaging in the viral lifecycle and functioning as an anti- and/or pro-viral factor. Autophagy thus becomes a promising target against virus infection. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an accumulation of studies aiming to investigate the roles of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection by using different models and from distinct angles, providing valuable information for systematically and comprehensively dissecting the interplay between autophagy and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we summarize the advancements in the studies of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and autophagy, as well as detailed molecular mechanisms. We also update the current knowledge on the pharmacological strategies used to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication through remodeling autophagy. These extensive studies on SARS-CoV-2 and autophagy can advance our understanding of virus–autophagy interaction and provide insights into developing efficient antiviral therapeutics by regulating autophagy.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques.

For the first time, the authors show in‐vivo turnover of human brain border macrophages. The findings have implications for the understanding of brain border immunity and potential macrophage targeting therapies. keypoints Human border region macrophages are distinct from microglia. These distinct phenotypes are established early during embryonal development ‐ Brain border macrophages are partially replaced by bone marrow‐derived myeloid cells. The transcriptional phenotypes of glioblastoma‐associated macrophage are determined by the anatomical region.">

        <tr id="Age-related susceptibility to sepsis and endotoxemia is poorly defined, although hyperactivation of the immune system and the expansion of the visceral adipose as an immunological reservoir are underlying features. Macrophages from older organisms exhibit substantial changes, including chronic NLRP3 inflammasome activation, genomic remodeling and a dysfunctional, amplified inflammatory response upon new exposure to pathogen. However, the mechanisms by which old macrophages maintain their inflammatory phenotype during endotoxemia remains elusive. We previously identified Gdf3, a TGFβ superfamily cytokine, as a top-regulated gene by age and the NLRP3 inflammasome in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Here, we demonstrate that endotoxemia increases inflammatory (CD11c+) ATMs in a Gdf3- dependent manner in old mice. Lifelong systemic or myeloid-specific deletion of Gdf3 leads to reduced endotoxemia- induced inflammation, with decreased CD11c+ ATMs and inflammatory cytokines, and protection from hypothermia. Moreover, acute blockade of Gdf3 using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, phenocopies old mice with lifelong Gdf3-deficiency. We show that GDF3 promotes the inflammatory phenotype in ATMs by phosphorylating SMAD2/3. Mechanistically, the differential chromatin landscape of ATMs from old mice with or without myeloid-driven Gdf3 indicates that GDF3- SMAD2/3 signaling axis shifts the chromatin accessibility of ATMs towards an inflammatory state during aging. Furthermore, pharmaceutical inhibition of SMAD3 with a specific inhibitor of SMAD3 (SIS3) mimics Gdf3 deletion. SIS3 reduces endotoxemia-mediated inflammation with fewer CD11c+ ATMs and less severe hypothermia in old, but not young mice, as well as reduced mortality. In human adipose tissue, age positively correlates with GDF3 level, while inflammation correlates with pSMAD2/3 level. Overall, these results highlight the importance of GDF3-SMAD2/3 axis in driving inflammation in older organisms and identify this signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating endotoxemia-related inflammation in the aged.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated severity have been linked to uncontrolled inflammation and may be associated with changes in the microbiome of mucosal sites including the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity. These sites play an important role in host-microbe homeostasis, and disruption of epithelial barrier integrity during COVID-19 may potentially lead to exacerbated inflammation and immune dysfunction. Outcomes in COVID-19 are highly disparate, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal, and the impact of microbial dysbiosis on disease severity is unclear. Here, we obtained plasma, rectal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasal swabs from 86 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 12 healthy volunteers. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the microbial communities in the mucosal swabs and measured concentrations of circulating cytokines, markers of gut barrier integrity, and fatty acids in the plasma samples. We compared these plasma concentrations and microbiomes between healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients, some of whom had unfortunately died by the end of the study enrollment, and performed a correlation analysis between plasma variables and bacterial abundances. Rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients had reduced abundances of several commensal bacteria including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increased abundance of the opportunistic pathogens Eggerthella lenta and Hungatella hathewayi. Furthermore, the oral pathogen Scardovia wiggsiae was more abundant in the oropharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients who died. The abundance of both H. hathewayi and S. wiggsiae correlated with circulating inflammatory markers including IL-6, highlighting the possible role of the microbiome in COVID-19 severity and providing potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19.IMPORTANCEOutcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are highly disparate and are associated with uncontrolled inflammation; however, the individual factors that lead to this uncontrolled inflammation are not fully understood. Here, we report that severe COVID-19 is associated with systemic inflammation, microbial translocation, and microbial dysbiosis. The rectal and oropharyngeal microbiomes of COVID-19 patients were characterized by a decreased abundance of commensal bacteria and an increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens, which positively correlated with markers of inflammation and microbial translocation. These microbial perturbations may, therefore, contribute to disease severity in COVID-19 and highlight the potential for microbiome-based interventions in improving COVID-19 outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) remain a significant global cause of infectious disease-related mortality. Accurate discrimination between acute bacterial and viral LRTIs is crucial for optimal patient care, prevention of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, and resource allocation. Plasma samples from LRTI patients with bacterial (n = 36), viral (n = 27; excluding SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV-2 (n = 22), and mixed bacterial–viral (n = 38) etiology were analyzed for protein profiling. Whole-blood RNA samples from a subset of patients (bacterial, n = 8; viral, n = 8; and SARS-CoV-2, n = 8) were analyzed for transcriptional profiling. Lasso regression modeling identified a seven-protein signature (CRP, IL4, IL9, IP10, MIP1α, MIP1β, and TNFα) that discriminated between patients with bacterial (n = 36) vs viral (n = 27) infections with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. When comparing patients with bacterial and mixed bacterial–viral infections (antibiotics clinically justified; n = 74) vs patients with viral and SARS-CoV-2 infections (antibiotics clinically not justified; n = 49), a 10-protein signature (CRP, bFGF, eotaxin, IFNγ, IL1β, IL7, IP10, MIP1α, MIP1β, and TNFα) with an AUC of 0.94 was identified. The transcriptional profiling analysis identified 232 differentially expressed genes distinguishing bacterial (n = 8) from viral and SARS-CoV-2 (n = 16) etiology. Protein–protein interaction enrichment analysis identified 20 genes that could be useful in the differentiation between bacterial and viral infections. Finally, we examined the performance of selected published gene signatures for bacterial–viral differentiation in our gene set, yielding promising results. Further validation of both protein and gene signatures in diverse clinical settings is warranted to establish their potential to guide the treatment of acute LRTIs. IMPORTANCE Accurate differentiation between bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) is vital for effective patient care and resource allocation. This study investigated specific protein signatures and gene expression patterns in plasma and blood samples from LRTI patients that distinguished bacterial and viral infections. The identified signatures can inform the design of point-of-care tests that can aid healthcare providers in making informed decisions about antibiotic prescriptions in order to reduce unnecessary use, thereby contributing to reduced side effects and antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the potential for faster and more accurate diagnoses for improved patient management in acute LRTIs is compelling.">

        <tr id="In multiple sclerosis (MS), the leptomeninges (LM) are populated with immune cell aggregates that correlate with disease progression. The impact of LM inflammation on the adjacent dura is largely unknown. Using a mouse model of MS that induces brain LM inflammation and age-dependent disease progression, we found that encephalitogenic T cells and B220high B cells accumulate substantially in the brain LM and parenchyma of both young and aged mice, while the adjacent dura remains relatively inert. We also observed a population of anti-CD20 resistant B220low B cells in the dura and bone marrow that virtually disappear at disease onset and accumulate in the brain of young mice concomitant with disease remission. In contrast, aged mice show a paucity of brain-resident B220low B cells at the expense of class-switched B220high B cells concomitant with severe, chronic disease. In summary, dynamic changes in brain, LM and dural B cells are associated with age-dependent disease severity in an animal model of progressive MS.

        <tr id="Enteroviruses are a genus of small RNA viruses that are responsible for approximately one billion global infections annually. These infections range in severity from the common cold and flu-like symptoms to more severe diseases, such as viral myocarditis, pancreatitis, and neurological disorders, that continue to pose a global health challenge with limited therapeutic strategies currently available. In the current study, we sought to understand the interaction between coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which is a model enterovirus, and macrophage cells, as there is limited understanding of how this virus interacts with macrophage innate immune cells. Our study demonstrated that CVB3 can robustly activate macrophages without apparent viral replication in these cells. We also showed that myeloid cells lacked the viral entry receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, the expression of exogenous CAR in RAW264.7 macrophages was unable to overcome the viral replication deficit. Interestingly, the CAR expression was associated with altered inflammatory responses during prolonged infection. Additionally, we identified the autophagy protein LC3 as a novel stimulus for macrophage activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CVB3-induced macrophage activation and its implications for viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Lung tumor-promoting environmental exposures and γherpesvirus infections are associated with Type 17 inflammation. To test the effect of γherpesvirus infection in promoting lung tumorigenesis, we infected mutant K-Ras-expressing (K-RasLA1) mice with the murine γherpesvirus MHV68 via oropharyngeal aspiration. After 7 weeks, the infected mice displayed a more than 2-fold increase in lung tumors relative to their K-RasLA1 uninfected littermates. Assessment of cytokines in the lung revealed that expression of Type 17 cytokines (Il-6, Cxcl1, Csf3) peaked at day 7 post-infection. These observations correlated with the post-infection appearance of known immune mediators of tumor promotion via IL-17A in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice. Surprisingly, Cd84, an immune cell marker mRNA, did not increase in MHV68-infected wild-type mice lacking lung tumors. Csf3 and Cxcl1 protein levels increased more in the lungs of infected K-RasLA1 mice relative to infected wild-type littermates. Flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses indicated that the infected K-RasLA1 mice had increased Ly6Gdim/Ly6Chi immune cells in the lung relative to levels seen in uninfected control K-RasLA1 mice. Selective methylation of adenosines (m6A modification) in immune-cell-enriched mRNAs appeared to correlate with inflammatory infiltrates in the lung. These observations implicate γherpesvirus infection in lung tumor promotion and selective accumulation of immune cells in the lung that appears to be associated with m6A modification of mRNAs in those cells.">

        <tr id="Astroviruses are a common cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans and have been recognized to cause fatal cases of encephalitis. A major barrier to the study of human-infecting astroviruses is the lack of an in vivo model, as previous attempts failed to identify a suitable host that supports viral replication. We describe a novel murine model of infection using astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1), an astrovirus with high seroprevalence in humans that is a causative agent of encephalitis. VA1 RNA levels peak in heart tissue at day 7 post-inoculation. The cardiotropism was observed in multiple different murine genetic backgrounds evidenced by high VA1 RNA loads in heart tissue of A/J, C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, Balb/c, and J:ARC mice. Infectious VA1 particles could be recovered from heart tissue 3 and 5 days post-inoculation. Intracellular viral capsid was present in tissue sections based on immunofluorescent staining and viral RNA was detected in cardiac myocytes, endocardium, and endothelial cells based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. Histologically, we identified inflammatory infiltrates consistent with myocarditis in some mice, with viral RNA co-localizing with the infiltrates. These foci contained CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages. Viral RNA levels increased by > 10-fold in heart tissue or serum samples from Rag1 or Stat1 knockout mice, demonstrating the role of both adaptive and innate immunity in the response to VA1 infection. Based on the in vivo tropisms, we also tested cardiac-derived primary cells and determined that VA1 can replicate in human cardiac microvascular and coronary artery endothelial cells, suggesting a novel cardiovascular tropism in human cells. This novel in vivo model of a human-infecting astrovirus enables further characterization of viral pathogenesis and reveals a new cardiovascular tropism of astroviruses. Author Summary Astroviruses typically cause viral diarrhea in humans but can also cause serious infections of the brain. Previously, the methods available to study how these viruses lead to invasive infections were limited. Here, we describe the first system to study human-infecting astroviruses using mice. We demonstrate that mice are susceptible to astrovirus VA1, a strain that commonly infects humans and has been linked to fatal brain infections. The virus infected heart tissue and was associated with inflammation. When mice with impaired immune systems were infected with VA1, they were found to have higher amounts of virus in their hearts and blood. Linking back to human health, we also found that VA1 can infect cells derived from human blood vessels of the heart. This model will enable us to better understand how astroviruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection. Our findings also suggest that astroviruses could be linked to cardiovascular diseases, including in humans. In the future, we can develop interventions that will prevent and treat astrovirus infections in humans.">

        <tr id="Immune profiling of Nipah virus (NiV) infection survivors is essential for advancing our understanding of NiV pathogenesis, improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and guiding public health efforts to prevent future outbreaks. There is currently limited data available on the immune response to NiV infection. We aimed to elucidate the specific immune mechanisms involved in protection against NiV infection by analyzing the immune profiles of survivors of the Nipah outbreak in Kerala, India 2023. Immune cell populations were quantified and compared between survivors (up to 4 months post onset day of illness) and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore associations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes. Immune signatures common to all three cases were: a heretofore undescribed persistent lymphopenia including the CD4+ Treg compartment with the relative expansion of memory Tregs; trends indicative of global leukopenic modulation were observed in monocytes and granulocytes including an expansion of putatively immunosuppressive low-density granulocytes described recently in the context of severe COVID-19; altered mucosal homing with respect to integrin beta-7 (ITGB7) expressing subsets; increased mobilization of activated T-cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and plasmablasts in the early phase of infection. Comparative analysis based on clinical presentation and outcome yielded lower initial viremia, increased activated T-cell responses, expanded plasmablasts, and restoration of ITGB7 expressing CD8+ T-cells as possible protective signatures. This longitudinal study delineates putative protective signatures associated with milder NiV disease. It emphasizes the need for the development of immunotherapeutic interventions such as monoclonal antibodies to blunt early viremia and ameliorate pathogenesis.">

By employing a holistic approach involving the analysis of white blood cell transcriptomes, targeted lipidomics, cytokine and immune cell profiling, across the spectrum of disease severity groups, including mild non-hospitalized patients and healthy individuals, we now show that LM networks are profoundly altered in COVID-19, correlate with inflammatory patterns, and stratify patients according to disease severity. Central to this are CYP450-derived LMs such as 20-HETE, lipid peroxidation metabolites such as iPF2a-VI, and lipoxygenase-derived LMs such as 12-HETE, all of which are major vasoactive mediators of inflammation. Among them, 20-HETE appears to be a promising prognostic biomarker for ICU admission and a potential therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 disease. Our study thus underscores the significance of LM networks in COVID-19 pathophysiology and sheds light into the broader mechanisms driving viral pneumonia in humans.">

        <tr id="Patients with respiratory viral infections have altered immune responses, which may predispose them to cardiovascular complications. In the face of the pandemic of a new kind of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is a resurgence of interest in the early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of patients who are at risk. COVID-19 often manifests as viral pneumonia, although extrapulmonary manifestations are also common. Acute cardiac damage associated with elevated highsensitivity troponin levels crucially contributes to mortality in severe COVID-19. The present review clinically compares cardiovascular complications between COVID-19 and other respiratory infections caused by singlestranded RNA viruses, namely influenza, SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Estimating the death rate from RVIs has been a subject of intense research, but the mortality from cardiovascular complications in these infections is less understood and calls for further research.">

        <tr id="IL-23 signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases, yet the cellular targets and signaling pathways affected by this cytokine remain poorly understood. We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

Such interactions have not been easy to characterize in vivo, particularly for infections of the central nervous system (CNS). We developed a dual-labeling virus with the capability of distinguishing abortive or productive viral replication in vivo. We used this virus to examine the response of different CNS cell types to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. Additionally, we were able to uncover early host responses and assess their impact on primary infection. Investigation of other virus–host interactions can use this dual labeling strategy to better track the dynamics and specificity of virus–host interactions.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors are frequently observed to present persistent symptoms constituting what has been called “post-acute COVID-19 syndrome” (PACS) or “long COVID-19”. Some clinical risk factors have been identified to be associated with PACS development; however, specific mechanisms responsible for PACS pathology remain unknown. This study investigates clinical, immunological, and metabolomic risk factors associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) in 51 patients, assessed 7–19 months after acute infection. Among the participants, 62.7% were male and 37.2% were female, with an average age of 47.8 years. At the follow-up, 37.2% met the criteria for PACS, revealing significant differences in immunological and metabolomic profiles at the time of acute infection. Patients with PACS were characterized by elevated levels of mature low-density granulocytes (LDGs), interleukin-8 (IL-8), pyruvate, pseudouridine, and cystine. Baseline multivariate analysis showed increased pyruvate and decreased alpha tocopherol levels. At follow-up, there was a decrease in absolute B lymphocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid levels. These findings suggest that specific immunological and metabolomic markers during acute infection can help identify patients at higher risk of developing persistent PACS.">

        <tr id="Epithelial injury calls for a regenerative response from a coordinated network of epithelial stem cells and immune cells. Defining this network is key to preserving the repair process for acute resolution, but also for preventing a remodeling process with chronic dysfunction. We recently identified an immune niche for basal-epithelial stem cells using mouse models of injury after respiratory viral infection. Niche function depended on an early sentinel population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) that provided ligand GPNMB to basal-ESC receptor CD44 for reprogramming towards chronic lung disease. These same cell and molecular control points worked directly in mouse and human basal-ESC organoids, but the findings were not yet validated in vivo in human disease. Further, persistence of GPNMB expression in moDCs and M2-macrophages in mouse models suggested utility as a long-term disease biomarker in humans. Here we show increased expression of GPNMB localized to moDC-macrophage populations in lung tissue samples from long-term Covid, asthma, and COPD. The findings thereby provide initial evidence of a persistent and correctable pathway from acute injury to chronic disease with implications for cellular reprogramming and inflammatory memory.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease and is widespread over the world. This disease shows a 5.1% mortality. The understanding of the disease has expanded rapidly in many areas, including virological, epidemiological, clinical, and management dimensions. To better understand the inflammatory and immune profiles that impact the pathogenesis and development of severe COVID-19 symptoms, further studies are essential. This research aims to explore the inflammatory and adaptive immune responses associated with COVID-19, considering factors such as genetic diversity and environmental exposure among Saudi patients. The goal is to determine if patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit different disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: This case-control study includes 115 participants (healthy and with COVID-19 infection), 55 of which had confirmed cases of COVID-19 in intensive care units (ICUs) at different hospitals in Makkah City, Saudi Arabia. Whole blood samples were collected from June to September 2021 for cellular analyses, and inflammation marker data were collected from hospital records. The expression of activation markers on B (CD27 and CD38) and T cells (CD27 and HLA-DR) was obtained using the flow cytometry technique. Also, serum was collected for cytokine measurements, including IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF- α. Results: The results indicated that lymphopenia and excessive T cell activation were more prevalent in severe cases than in healthy individuals. Furthermore, the results revealed that severe COVID-19 patients had an increased frequency of CD19+ B cells, with changes in B cell subsets. The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers with pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers in severe COVID-19 cases, which could be targeted for therapeutic interventions. This might be a valuable approach for the diagnosis and treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are also associated with blood neutrophilia. The mechanistic relevance of this to symptoms or behavior is unclear. We used cytometry, immunohistochemistry, whole tissue clearing, and single-cell sequencing to characterize the meningeal immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice. We find that chronic, but not acute, stress causes meningeal neutrophil accumulation, and CSD increases neutrophil trafficking in vascular channels emanating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggested CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils. Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protected against the anhedonic and anxiogenic effects of CSD stress, potentially through reduced infiltration of IFNAR+ neutrophils into the meninges from skull BM. Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders. One sentence summary Type I interferon sensing neutrophils accumulate in meninges of psychosocially stressed mice via skull bone marrow channels and are associated with the negative behavioral sequelae of stress; blockade of this pathway inhibits neutrophil trafficking and improves behavioral outcomes.">

        <tr id="Introduction After mild COVID-19 that does not require hospitalization, some individuals develop persistent symptoms that may worsen over time, producing a multisystemic condition termed Post-COVID condition (PCC). Among other disorders, PCC is characterized by persistent changes in the immune system that may not be solved several months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods People with PCC were recruited to determine the distribution and functionality of CD4+ T helper (Th) subsets in comparison with individuals with mild, severe, and critical presentations of acute COVID-19 to evaluate their contribution as risk or protective factors for PCC. Results People with PCC showed low levels of Th1 cells, similar to individuals with severe and critical COVID-19, although these cells presented a higher capacity to express IFNγ in response to stimulation. Th2/Th1 correlation was negative in individuals with acute forms of COVID-19, but there was no significant Th2/Th1 correlation in people with PCC. Th2 cells from people with PCC presented high capacity to express IL-4 and IL-13, which are related to low ventilation and death associated with COVID-19. Levels of proinflammatory Th9 and Th17 subsets were significantly higher in people with PCC in comparison with acute COVID-19, being Th1/Th9 correlation negative in these individuals, which probably contributed to a more pro-inflammatory than antiviral scenario. Th17 cells from approximately 50% of individuals with PCC had no capacity to express IL-17A and IL-22, similar to individuals with critical COVID-19, which would prevent clearing extracellular pathogens. Th2/Th17 correlation was positive in people with PCC, which in the absence of negative Th1/Th2 correlation could also contribute to the proinflammatory state. Finally, Th22 cells from most individuals with PCC had no capacity to express IL-13 or IL-22, which could increase tendency to reinfections due to impaired epithelial regeneration. Discussion People with PCC showed skewed polarization of CD4+ Th subsets with altered functionality that was more similar to individuals with severe and critical presentations of acute COVID-19 than to people who fully recovered from mild disease. New strategies aimed at reprogramming the immune response and redirecting CD4+ Th cell polarization may be necessary to reduce the proinflammatory environment characteristic of PCC.">

Injury to the wall includes infection/inflammation and/or injury to the resident cells of the wall. We postulate that in COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus directly infects the alveolar type II cell or directly or indirectly infects/injures the pericyte, promoting inflammation and interaction with endothelial cells, thereby causing a cascade of events leading to our observation that thrombosis occurred within the walls of the pulmonary vessels and not in the lumen of the vascular circulation.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a deadly pulmonary disease with impaired immunological response that causes significant tissue damage and organ failure. Postmortem examination of the lung is a useful tool for understanding the immunopathogenesis of this virus. Lung autopsy samples from seven dead SARS-CoV-2 patients were obtained and evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin stain to analyze the histopathological changes in those samples, on the other hand, Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used for detection of CD21, CD1a, CR1 (CD35), CD68, Myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD15, CD56, CD3, CD20, CD4, and CD8 cells markers. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse alveolar damage with extensive parenchymal architecture distortion, intravascular fibrin clot, deposition of collagen fibers, vascular congestions and blood vessels containing thrombi, pneumocyte type II with inflammatory cell infiltration. The IHC staining for the innate immune cells such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells, Macrophages, and neutrophils showed a strong positive staining, while CD56 Natural killer (NK) cells showed negative staining. On the other hand, the specific immune cells including; CD20 B cells, CD3 T cells, and CD4 helper T cells, showed positive staining while CD8 Cytotoxic T cells showed negative staining. The lung autopsy samples from patients with COVID-19 confirmed the presence of APCs through the positive staining of CD21, CD1a, CD35, CD68, MPO, and CD15 expressed the virus recognition, proinflammatory cytokine production, and adaptive immune cells activation through CD3, CD4, and CD20 positive staining and the role of APCs in the severity of pulmonary infection and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection however the absence of the CD56 NK and CD8 cytotoxic T explains the worse infection status for the patients.">

        <tr id="Signatures of neurodegeneration in clinical samples from a subject with multiple sclerosis (MS) acutely infected with HIV were investigated with single-cell transcriptomics using 10X Chromium technology. Sequencing was carried out on NovaSeq-TM, and the analysis was performed with Cell Ranger software (v 7.1.0) associated with a specifically established bioinformatic pipeline. A total of 1446 single-cell transcriptomes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 4647 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained. In the CSF, many T-cell lymphocytes with an enriched amount of plasma cells and plasmacytoid dendritic (pDC) cells, as compared to the PBMCs, were detected. An unsupervised cluster analysis, putting together our patient transcriptomes with those of a publicly available MS scRNA-seq dataset, showed up-regulated microglial neurodegenerative gene expression in four clusters, two of which included our subject’s transcriptomes. A few HIV-1 transcripts were found only in the CD4 central memory T-cells of the CSF compartment, mapping to the gag-pol, vpu, and env regions. Our data, which describe the signs of neurodegenerative gene expression in a very peculiar clinical situation, did not distinguish the cause between multiple sclerosis and HIV infection, but they can give a glimpse of the high degree of resolution that may be obtained by the single-cell transcriptomic approach.">

        <tr id="Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pleiotropic cytokine, able to promote both myelopoiesis and activation of immune cells. Particularly in the lung, GM-CSF plays an important homeostatic role in the development and maintenance of alveolar macrophages, and is therefore considered to play a role in respiratory virus infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, although the benefits of GM-CSF treatment in clinical studies remain inconclusive. To address this, we tested inhaled GM-CSF treatment in the Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM) mouse model. Our findings show that local GM-CSF therapy during PVM disease increased local neutrophilia and monocyte-derived cell influx, but diminished CD8+ T cells responses. Despite this, the observed effects on T cells and myeloid cells did not result in an altered clinical outcome during PVM infection. We conclude that inhaled GM-CSF therapy cannot be considered as a universal protective therapy in respiratory virus infections.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is a significant global health concern due to its association with neurodevelopmental disorders such as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). This study aimed to compare the replication kinetics, viral persistence, cytopathogenic effects, and immune gene expression in human microglia cells (CHME-3) infected with an Asian lineage ZIKV (PRVABC59, referred to as ZIKV-PRV) and an African lineage ZIKV (IBH30656, referred to as ZIKV-IBH). We found that ZIKV-PRV replicated more efficiently and persisted longer while inducing lower levels of cell death and inflammatory gene activation compared with ZIKV-IBH. These findings suggest that the enhanced replication and persistence of ZIKV-PRV, along with its ability to evade innate immune responses, may underlie its increased neuropathogenic potential, especially in the context of CZS. In contrast, ZIKV-IBH, with its stronger immune gene activation and higher cytopathogenicity, may lead to more acute infections with faster viral clearance, thereby reducing the likelihood of chronic central nervous system (CNS) infection. This study provides crucial insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving the differential pathogenicity of ZIKV lineages and highlights the need for further research to pinpoint the viral factors responsible for these distinct clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Mitochondria are vital for most cells' functions. Viruses hijack mitochondria machinery for misappropriation of energy supply or to bypass defense mechanisms. Many of these mitochondrial dysfunctions persist after recovery from treated or untreated viral infections, particularly when mitochondrial DNA is permanently damaged. Quantitative defects and structural rearrangements of mitochondrial DNA accumulate in post-mitotic tissues as recently reported long after SARS-CoV-2 or HIV infection, or following antiviral therapy. These observations are consistent with the "hit-and-run" concept proposed decades ago to explain viro-induced cell transformation and it could apply to delayed post-viral onsets of symptoms and advocate for complementary supportive care. Thus, according to this concept, following exposure to viruses or antiviral agents, mitochondrial damage could evolve into an autonomous clinical condition. It also establishes a pathogenic link between communicable and non-communicable chronic diseases.">

        <tr id="Frequent recent spillovers of subtype H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus into poultry and mammals, especially dairy cattle, including several human cases, increased concerns over a possible future pandemic. Here, we performed an analysis of epitope data curated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). We found that the patterns of immunodominance of seasonal influenza viruses circulating in humans and H5N1 are similar. We further conclude that a significant fraction of the T cell epitopes is conserved at a level associated with cross-reactivity between avian and seasonal sequences, and we further experimentally demonstrate extensive cross-reactivity in the most dominant T cell epitopes curated in the IEDB. Based on these observations, and the overall similarity of the neuraminidase (NA) N1 subtype encoded in both HPAI and seasonal H1N1 influenza virus as well as cross-reactive group 1 HA stalk-reactive antibodies, we expect that a degree of pre-existing immunity is present in the general human population that could blunt the severity of human H5N1 infections.">

Primarily caused by viruses infecting the lower respiratory tract, symptoms include cough, congestion, and low-grade fever, potentially leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccines are biopharmaceutical formulations that employ mRNA molecules to induce specific immune responses, facilitating the expression of viral or bacterial antigens and promoting immunization against infectious diseases. Notably, this technology had significant relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic, as these formulations helped to limit SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Importantly, mRNA vaccines promise to be implemented as new alternatives for fighting other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, human respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus.

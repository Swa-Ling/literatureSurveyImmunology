        <tr id="The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has threatened human health worldwide. Among protective immune reactions, T cell responses are diverse among individuals, which is related to the differences in severity. A T cell subset, regulatory T (Treg) cells, is crucial for limiting excessive immune responses. If SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs are developed during infection, they may counteract anti-viral immunity and cause severe symptom. To address this possibility, we conducted single-cell TCR-RNA-sequencing of PBMCs from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Among thirteen donors, one with severe symptom had substantially more FOXP3-expressing Treg clonotypes activated in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virion or other major antigen proteins. To define the reactivity of these Treg clonotypes, fifteen highly expanded Treg clonotypes were reconstituted into reporter cells and stimulated with 27 distinct peptide pools that cover all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However, none of these clonotypes react to any SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Instead, the reporter cells expressing one TCR clonotype (23599) were activated in the presence of EBV-transformed B cells without adding exogenous antigens. Furthermore, 23599 TCR-expressing cells were activated by non-transformed naïve syngenic B cells in DQA1*03:03-DQB1*04:01-dependent manner, suggesting that clonotype 23599 may be autoreactive. This Treg clonotype, 23599, was also detected in a public TCR database, and significantly expanded in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not the dominant antigen inducing Treg during infection.">

        <tr id="Severity of COVID-19 is affected by multiple factors; however, it is not understood how the inflammatory milieu of the lung at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure affects the control of viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that immune events in the mouse lung closely preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection affect viral control and identify innate immune pathways that limit viral replication. Pulmonary inflammatory stimuli including resolved, antecedent respiratory infections with Staphylococcus aureus or influenza, ongoing pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, ovalbumin/alum-induced asthma, or airway administration of TLR ligands and recombinant cytokines all establish an antiviral state in the lung that restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to antiviral type I interferons, TNFα and IL-1 potently precondition the lung for enhanced viral control. Our work shows that SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from an immunologically quiescent lung microenvironment and suggests that heterogeneity in pulmonary inflammation preceding SARS-CoV-2 exposure may contribute to variability in disease outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is accompanied by elevated liver enzymes, and patients with pre‐existing liver conditions experience more severe disease. While it was known that SARS‐CoV‐2 infects human hepatocytes, our study determines the mechanism of infection, demonstrates viral replication and spread, and highlights direct hepatocyte damage. Viral replication was readily detectable upon infection of primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells with the ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2, Delta, and Omicron variants. Hepatocytes express the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor ACE2 and the host cell protease TMPRSS2, and knocking down ACE2 and TMPRSS2 impaired SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Progeny viruses released from infected hepatocytes showed the typical coronavirus morphology by electron microscopy and proved infectious when transferred to fresh cells, indicating that hepatocytes can contribute to virus spread. Importantly, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection rapidly induced hepatocyte death in a replication‐dependent fashion, with the Omicron variant showing faster onset but less extensive cell death. C57BL/6 wild‐type mice infected with a mouse‐adapted SARS‐CoV‐2 strain showed high levels of viral RNA in liver and lung tissues. ALT peaked when viral RNA was cleared from the liver. Liver histology revealed profound tissue damage and immune cell infiltration, indicating that direct cytopathic effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 and immune‐mediated killing of infected hepatocytes contribute to liver pathology.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains endemic worldwide. Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B and T lymphocytes in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has presented formidable challenges to global health since its emergence in late 2019. While primarily known for respiratory symptoms, it can also affect the ocular surface. This review summarizes the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on ocular surface immunity and inflammation, focusing on infection mechanisms, immune responses, and clinical manifestations. Ocular symptoms, though uncommon, include conjunctivitis, dry eye, and blurred vision. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in ocular surface epithelial cells, facilitating viral entry, replication, and local dissemination. The innate immune responses involving corneal epithelial cells and immune cells are discussed, alongside mechanisms of antigen presentation and adaptive immunity. The review also examines the roles of cytokines and chemokines in mediating ocular surface inflammation and explores the impact of cytokine storms and chronic inflammation on ocular health. Additionally, the interplay between systemic and ocular immune responses is highlighted, analyzing how systemic COVID-19 inflammation influences ocular surface health. These insights underscore the broader implications of COVID-19 beyond localized ocular infection. By consolidating current findings, this review aims to guide preventive and therapeutic strategies while identifying directions for future research to mitigate the ocular consequences of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of COVID-19, led to an ongoing pandemic with devastating consequences for the global economy and human health. With the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, multidisciplinary initiatives were launched to explore new diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccination strategies. From this perspective, proteomics could help to understand the mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify new therapeutic options. A TMT-based quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis was performed to study the proteome remodeling of human lung alveolar cells expressing human ACE2 (A549-ACE2) after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Detectability and the prognostic value of selected proteins was analyzed by targeted PRM. A total of 6802 proteins and 6428 phospho-sites were identified in A549-ACE2 cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The differential proteins here identified revealed that A549-ACE2 cells undergo a time-dependent regulation of essential processes, delineating the precise intervention of the cellular machinery by the viral proteins. From this mechanistic background and by applying machine learning modeling, 29 differential proteins were selected and detected in the serum of COVID-19 patients, 14 of which showed promising prognostic capacity. Targeting these proteins and the protein kinases responsible for the reported phosphorylation changes may provide efficient alternative strategies for the clinical management of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Few pathogens have historically been subjected to as intense scientific and clinical scrutiny as SARS-CoV-2. The genetic, immunological, and environmental factors influencing disease severity and post-infection clinical outcomes, known as correlates of immunity, remain largely undefined. Clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to those with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms. While most infected individuals return to their former health and fitness within a few weeks, some develop debilitating chronic symptoms, referred to as long-COVID. Autoimmune responses have been proposed as one of the factors influencing long-COVID and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between viral infections and autoimmune pathologies is not new. Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, among others, have been shown to induce the production of autoantibodies and the onset of autoimmune conditions. Given the extensive literature on SARS-CoV-2, here we review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmune pathologies, with a focus on autoantibodies. We closely examine mechanisms driving autoantibody production, particularly their connection with disease severity and long-COVID.">

Coronavirus interactions with host innate immune antiviral responses are an important determinant of disease outcome. This review compares the host's innate response to different human coronaviruses. Host antiviral defenses discussed in this review include frontline defenses against respiratory viruses in the nasal epithelium, early sensing of viral infection by innate immune effectors, double-stranded RNA and stress-induced antiviral pathways, and viral antagonism of innate immune responses conferred by conserved coronavirus nonstructural proteins and genus-specific accessory proteins. The common cold coronaviruses HCoV-229E and -NL63 induce robust interferon signaling and related innate immune pathways, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 induce intermediate levels of activation, and MERS-CoV shuts down these pathways almost completely.">

        <tr id="An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in over 7 million confirmed deaths. In addition to severe respiratory and systematic symptoms, several comorbidities increase the risk of fatal outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing conditions in patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. Recent clinical studies have reported the reactivation of human herpesviruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), in severe COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. To support these clinical observations, we established a KSHV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection system in A549-hACE2 cells. Our findings indicate that co-infection with live SARS-CoV-2 sharply induces KSHV lytic reactivation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in global cellular gene expression in KSHV-infected A549-hACE2 cells, both with and without SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. These data provide a molecular basis for understanding whether patients with pre-existing oncogenic herpesvirus infections are at increased risk for more severe COVID-19 or for developing virus-associated cancers even after full recovery from COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Introduction The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, notably delta and omicron, has significantly accelerated the global pandemic, worsening conditions worldwide. However, there is a lack of research concerning the molecular mechanisms related to immune responses and metabolism induced by these variants. Methods Here, metabolomics combined with transcriptomics was performed to elucidate the immunometabolic changes in the lung of hamsters infected with delta and omicron variants. Results Both variants caused acute inflammation and lung pathology in intranasally infected hamsters. Principal component analysis uncovered the delta variant significantly altered lung metabolite levels between the pre- and post-infection states. Additionally, metabolic pathways determined by assessment of metabolites and genes in lung revealed significant alterations in arginine biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism upon infection with both variants and closely linked to inflammatory cytokines, indicating immune activation and oxidative stress in response to both variants. These metabolic changes were also evident in the serum, validating the presence of systemic alterations corresponding to those identified in lung. Notably, the delta variant induced a more robust metabolic regulation than the omicron variant. Discussion The study suggests that multi-omics is a valuable approach for understanding immunometabolic responses to infectious diseases, and providing insights for effective treatment strategies.">

In the majority of patients (73%), we found antibodies against the Spike protein above the thresh-old of positivity. Likewise, patients showed a promising cellular response: the upregulated production of INFγ, TNFα and CXCL10 by T cells did not differ from the response of healthy controls.

        <tr id="It has been reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can result in long-term neurological symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, however the specific mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Initially, we confirmed a reduction in the level of synaptic proteins in SH-SY5Y neurons following SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 Nsps are crucial for the efficient replication of the virus and play important roles in the interaction between virus and host cell. Nsps screening experiments implied that Nsp7 is able to reduce the level of synapsin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Nsp7 in SH-SY5Y cells and mouse primary neurons demonstrated that Nsp7 could decrease the levels of synaptic proteins without affecting neuronal viability. Moreover, C57BL/6 mice receiving AAV-GFP-Nsp7 injections into the ventral hippocampus displayed impaired memory ability, along with reduced dendritic spine density and synaptic protein levels. Mechanistic investigations suggested that Nsp7-induced mitochondrial damage led to ROS production and ATP levels decreasing in neurons. Additional experiments employing the ROS inhibitor NAC demonstrated that Nsp7 suppressed the expression of synaptic proteins via ROS inducing, implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in synaptic plasticity impairment and subsequent cognitive dysfunction. Our findings underscore the crucial role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7 in cognitive dysfunction, which is potentially mediated through impaired synaptic plasticity via mitochondrial damage. This study enhances our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying central nervous system-related symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background To date, it is still not clear why during the COVID-19 pandemic children generally developed no or milder symptoms compared to adults. As innate immune responses are crucial in the early defense against pathogens, we aimed at profiling these responses from both adults and children with a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In the first months of the pandemic, PBMCs and serum were collected from peripheral blood of adults and children at different time points after testing SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive (PCR+). The levels of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific IgG were measured in serum. The cells were cultured for 24 hours in medium only, with heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (iSARS-CoV-2) or toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. The levels of secreted cytokines/chemokines as well as monocyte phenotype were determined. Results Few days after testing PCR+, PBMCs from PCR+ children secreted higher levels of cytokines/chemokines compared to PCR+ adults, after these cells were incubated either in medium only or after stimulation with iSARS-CoV-2 or TLR ligands. Furthermore, PBMCs from children stimulated with iSARS-CoV-2 secreted significantly higher levels of IL-10 and GM-CSF compared to PBMCs from control children. In contrast, PBMCs from the PCR+ adults secreted lower levels of IL-8 compared to adult controls. Phenotypic analysis of monocytes indicates a smaller proportion non-classical monocytes for adults compared to children. The distinct cytokine profiles, symptom severity, and the proportion of non-classical monocytes correlated to each other. The levels of Spike-specific IgG overtime did not significantly differ between children and adults. Conclusions Within the first week after testing PCR+, children showed a stronger inflammatory innate immune profile and experienced less severe symptoms compared to adults. Our data implies correlations between the secretion of cytokines/chemokines, proportion of non-classical monocytes, and symptoms severity. These findings enhance our understanding of the distinct pediatric and adult innate immune profile after SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes to the knowledge necessary to improve future prevention strategies.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, presents ongoing challenges to global public health. SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by rapidly evolving mutations, especially in (but not limited to) the spike protein, complicating predictions about its evolutionary trajectory. These mutations have significantly affected transmissibility, immune evasion, and vaccine efficacy, leading to multiple pandemic waves with over half a billion cases and seven million deaths globally. Despite several strategies, from rapid vaccine development and administration to the design and availability of antivirals, including monoclonal antibodies, already having been employed, the persistent circulation of the virus and the emergence of new variants continue to result in high case numbers and fatalities. In the past four years, immense research efforts have contributed much to our understanding of the viral pathogenesis mechanism, the COVID-19 syndrome, and the host–microbe interactions, leading to the development of effective vaccines, diagnostic tools, and treatments. The focus of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the functional impact of mutations on diagnosis, treatments, and vaccine effectiveness. We further discuss vaccine safety in pregnancy and the implications of hybrid immunity on long-term protection against infection, as well as the latest developments on a pan-coronavirus vaccine and nasal formulations, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance, research, and adaptive public health strategies in response to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution race.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to numerous cases of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), worldwide. This co-infection has increased patient mortality due to the lack of efficient bi-targeted drugs. Cambogin, a bioactive natural product, has been shown to effectively induce regression of KSHV-latently infected tumours in xenograft mice models; however, its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Here, we report that Cambogin targets 46 host genes commonly affected by both SARS-CoV-2 and KSHV infections, as identified through bioinformatics analysis. These genes are related with 14 key upstream signalling pathways, particularly those involved in inflammation regulation, protein phosphorylation, metabolic processes, and cellular stress response. Within the transcriptional factor (TF)-miRNA co-regulatory network, ten out of 46 hub-target genes are closely linked to Cambogin and KSHV/SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, Cambogin not only efficiently blocks the replication and virion production of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo by reducing the expression of EGFR and Cyclin A2, but also simultaneously inhibits both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the growth of KSHV-induced tumours in vivo using a murine xenograft model. These findings provide an alternative strategy for the potential use of Cambogin in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients, particularly those with KSHV co-infection.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 posed unprecedented global health challenges of massive proportions. The persistent effects of COVID-19 have become a subject of significant concern amongst the medical and scientific community. This article aims to explore the probability of a link between the COVID-19 infection and the risk of lung cancer development. First, this article reports that SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammatory response and cellular stress, potentially leading to tumorigenesis through common pathways between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer. These pathways include the JAK/STAT3 pathway which is activated after the initiation of cytokine storm following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This pathway is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and immune homeostasis. The JAK/STAT3 pathway is also hyperactivated in lung cancer which serves as a link thereof. It predisposes patients to lung cancer through myriad molecular mechanisms such as DNA damage, genomic instability, and cell cycle dysregulation. Another probable pathway to tumorigenesis is based on the possibility of an oncogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 through hijacking the p53 protein, leading to cell oxidative stress and interfering with the DNA repair mechanisms. Finally, this article highlights the overexpression of the SLC22A18 gene in lung cancer. This gene can be overexpressed by the ZEB1 transcription factor, which was found to be highly expressed during COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, particularly low-density neutrophils (LDNs), are believed to contribute to acute COVID-19 severity. Here, we showed that neutrophilia can be detected acutely and even months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and mice, while neutrophil depletion reduced disease severity in mice. A key factor in neutrophilia and severe disease in infected mice was traced to the chemokine CXCL12 secreted by bone marrow cells and unexpectedly, endothelial cells. CXCL12 levels were negatively correlated with LDN numbers in longitudinal analyses of patient blood samples. CXCL12 blockade in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice increased blood/lung neutrophil numbers thereby accelerating disease progression without changing lung virus titers. The exaggerated mortality caused by CXCL12 blockade can be reversed by neutrophil depletion. In addition, blocking interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) reduced CXCL12 levels, suggesting a signal transduction from virus-mediated ACE2 ligation to increased CXCL12 secretion. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of CXCL12 in diminishing neutrophilia, including low density neutrophilia, and its deleterious effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results also support the involvement of SARS-CoV-2-endothelial cell interactions in viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Understanding the early interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human airway epithelial cells is essential for unraveling viral replication and spread mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the early dynamics of airway epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection using well-differentiated human nasal and tracheal epithelial cell cultures by incorporating three publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We identified a previously uncharacterized cell population, termed virus-rich intermediate (VRI) cells, representing an intermediate differentiation stage between basal and ciliated cells. These VRI cells exhibited high viral loads at all infection time points, strong interferon and inflammatory responses, increased mRNA expression of microvilli-related genes (PAK1, PAK4, VIL1), and suppression of apoptosis markers (BAX, CASP3) alongside increased anti-apoptotic gene expression (BCL2). Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that VRI cells send signals to basal cells via receptor-ligand pathways such as EPHA and VEGF, likely promoting basal cell differentiation and proliferation through MAPK signaling. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes VRI cells as a primary site for replication and spread, leveraging these cells’ unique differentiation state to evade host cell death and facilitate viral propagation. This study provides insights into the early cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights potential therapeutic targets to limit viral spread.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the worst pandemics in human history. The causative virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can invade host cells in multiple organs by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II expressed on the cell surface. Once inside the host cell, viral replication takes place, leading to cellular disruption and the release of signal molecules that are recognised by the innate immune system. Innate immunity activation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and primes the adaptive immune system. The proinflammatory environment defends against further viral entry and replication. SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to lead to myocardial injury through several mechanisms. Firstly, direct viral-mediated cellular invasion of cardiomyocytes has been shown in in vitro and histological studies, which is related to cellular injury. Secondly, the proinflammatory state during COVID-19 can lead to myocardial injury and the release of protein remnants of the cardiac contractile machinery. Thirdly, the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is associated with thromboembolism of coronary arteries and/or other vascular systems. COVID-19 patients can also develop heart failure; however, the underlying mechanism is much less well-characterised than for myocardial injury. Several questions remain regarding COVID-19-related heart failure, including its potential reversibility, the role of anti-viral medications in its prevention, and the mechanisms underlying heart failure pathogenesis in long COVID-19. Further work is required to improve our understanding of the mechanism of cardiac sequelae in COVID-19, which may enable us to target SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients against longer-lasting cardiovascular complications.">

VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the respiratory system and other organ systems. Tissue injuries resulting from viral infection and host hyperinflammatory responses may lead to moderate to severe pneumonia, systemic complications, and even death. While anti-inflammatory agents have been used to treat patients with severe COVID-19, their therapeutic effects are limited. GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) is a pro-inflammatory receptor expressed on vascular endothelial cells, regulating leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a GPR4 antagonist, NE-52-QQ57, in the SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Our results demonstrated that GPR4 antagonist treatment increased the survival rate in this severe COVID-19 mouse model. The inflammatory response, characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was reduced in the GPR4 antagonist group compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, both SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and infectious viral titers in the mouse lung were decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive mouse brains was also decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, the GPR4 antagonist inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero E6 cells. Together, these results suggest that GPR4 antagonism may be explored as a novel approach for the treatment of COVID-19 and other similar viral diseases.">

Beyond its primary respiratory impact, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in various extra-pulmonary complications. Research studies reveal that the virus affects multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system (CNS), largely due to the widespread expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. Clinical evidence shows that the virus can induce diabetes by disrupting pancreatic and liver functions as well as cause acute kidney injury. Additionally, neurological complications, including cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation, have been observed in a significant number of COVID-19 patients. This review discusses the mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 to acute kidney injury, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), emphasizing its effects on pancreatic beta cells, insulin resistance, and the regulation of gluconeogenesis. We also explore how SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological complications, detailing the intricate pathways of neuro-invasion and the potential to trigger conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). By elucidating the metabolic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, this review underscores the imperative for continued research and the development of effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term and short-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background: Investigation of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants and COVID-19 vaccination on inflammatory and immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited in South Asia. Objectives: We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 vaccination and waves of COVID-19 on inflammatory and immunological biomarkers among COVID-19 patients in India. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of vitamin D and zinc during COVID-19 infection in India (N=181). Blood samples and data regarding vaccination doses were collected. The second (Delta) or third (Omicron) wave was determined by date of enrolment. Mixed effects linear regression with robust standard errors was used to examine associations between COVID-19 vaccination dose or wave at enrolment and C-Reactive Protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM). Results: Compared to no vaccination, full vaccination was associated with lower LDH (P<0.001), D-dimer (P=0.521) and Ang-2 (P=0.046), and higher IgG levels (P<0.001). Partial vaccination was associated with lower IL-6 (P=0.040) and higher IgG (P<0.001). Enrolment during the third wave was associated with lower IL-6 (P<0.001), CRP (P=0.056), IgM (P=0.013), and IgG (P<0.001), but higher D-dimer levels (P<0.001). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination status and SARS-CoV-2 variant influence the inflammatory and immunologic response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the severity of clinical presentation.

        <tr id="Diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) represent two public health emergencies. In severe disease, both pathogens may share a biological niche in the lower respiratory tract. There is significant potential for SARS-CoV-2 and M.tb infections to be co-present within individuals and enhance or moderate the respective outcomes of either infection. Here, we investigated how whole blood samples, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, from individuals hospitalised with acute COVID-19 disease respond to mycobacterial challenge. To do this, samples were assessed by ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assays, immune cell phenotyping by mass cytometry, and whole blood cytokine responses to mycobacterial antigens assessed by flow cytometry. These studies identified a subgroup of COVID-19 patients whose blood had an enhanced capacity to inhibit mycobacterial growth. The ability to control mycobacterial growth was associated with the presence of a non M.tb-specific CD28+ CD8+ T cell population, with a particular activation status and migratory phenotype. This work improves our understanding of factors involved in mycobacterial control, and may contribute to the design of novel therapies for TB.">

        <tr id="Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is an uncontrolled plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow, leading to immune dysregulation with impaired humoral immune responses. Conversely, cellular-based responses play a vital role in MM patients. However, the extent and duration of cellular-induced protection remain unclear to date. Here, immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) like Lenalidomide (Lena) become interesting, as they may have stimulatory effects on T-cell functioning. Methods In this study we investigated immune responses elicited by COVID-19 vaccine or infection comparing 43 healthy volunteers (avg. 35y, 72.1% female, 81.4% previously COVID-19 infected), with 41 MM patients under Lena maintenance therapy (avg. 63.8y, 51.2% female, 61% previously COVID-19 infected). Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), spike-RBD, and nucleocapsid (N) were measured via ELISA in subjects’ plasma. Freshly isolated PBMCs, incubated with SARS-CoV-2 peptides (N, S), activation induced marker (AIM) assays and flow cytometry, allowed us to assess cellular responses (CD8+ T, T(F)H: CD4+ T (follicular) helper). Results Whereas healthy controls showed significant better humoral responses (N IgA p<0.001), T cell responses were robust in the MM group (higher S-act. TH, p<0.001). Stratified by COVID-19 status, the MM group showed higher N-act. TH (p=0.03). These results were unchanged comparing a Lena intake with Lena break around vaccination. Discussion Taken together, MM patients under Lena therapy exhibit weakened antibody production but present a robust T cell response following SARS-COV-2 infection or vaccination. Our results highlight the importance of vaccination in this subgroup and moreover, argue against a Lena intake break around the time of vaccination.">

Thus, warranting further studies in experimental animal models to understand how modulation of Cx43 expression can influence MS pathology. Intracranial infection with murine-β-coronavirus Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) in mice results in acute pathology characterized by high viral titers, glial activation in the brain and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination, effectively mimicking key pathological hallmarks of MS and serving as a robust model to investigate its viral etiology. MHV-A59 infection leads to a pronounced downregulation of Cx43 during the acute phase, emphasizing its critical role in virus-induced CNS pathology. In this study, we investigated the potential of in vivo 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) administration in modulating Cx43 expression in this MHV-induced model and its consequence on chronic virus-induced demyelination. Our results reveal that 4-PBA treatment reduced acute MHV-A59 infectivity and viral spread in the brain while modulating the glial cell response, mounting host immunity. Treatment with 4-PBA effectively preserved the expression of both Cx43 and Cx47 in infected CNS cells, counteracting their infection-induced downregulation. Furthermore, MHV-A59 infection downregulated the expression of ER-resident thioredoxin family protein (ERp29), a well-known molecular chaperone of Cx43, which was rescued by 4-PBA treatment. We further validated if such downregulation of ERp29 is also evident in MS demyelinating plaques. In human MS patient-derived brain tissue, reduced Cx43 and ERp29 staining was observed in demyelinating plaques. Our studies revealed that 4-PBA treatment not only limits viral replication and spread throughout the brain but also protects the mice against severe chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination. These findings suggest that targeting Cx43 with 4-PBA holds significant therapeutic potential for addressing virus-induced neuroinflammatory demyelination and MS by preserving gap junction intercellular communication.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 and other pandemic viruses continue being important for public health and the global economy. Therefore, it is essential to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19 more deeply, particularly its association with inflammatory and antiviral processes. In this study, we used the RNA-seq technique to analyze mRNA and non-coding RNA profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals after SARS-CoV-2 in vitro exposure, to identify pathways related to immune response and the regulatory post-transcriptional mechanisms triggered that can serve as possible complementary therapeutic targets. Our analyses show that SARS-CoV-2 induced a significant regulation in the expression of 790 genes in PBMCs, of which 733 correspond to mRNAs and 57 to non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The immune response, antiviral response, signaling, cell proliferation and metabolism are the main biological processes involved. Among these, the inflammatory response groups the majority of regulated genes with an increase in the expression of chemokines involved in the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and T-cells. Additionally, it was observed that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 induces the expression of genes related to the IL-27 pathway but not of IFN-I or IFN-III, indicating the induction of ISGs through this pathway rather than the IFN genes. Moreover, several lncRNA and RNA binding proteins that can act in the cis-regulation of genes of the IL-27 pathway were identified. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can regulate the expression of multiple genes in PBMCs, mainly related to the inflammatory and antiviral response. Among these, lncRNAs establish an important mechanism in regulating the immune response to the virus. They could contribute to developing severe forms of COVID-19, constituting a possible therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Clinical outcomes resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to the development of mild to severe respiratory illness, and in some instances, chronic lingering disease and mortality. The underlying biological mechanisms driving this wide spectrum of pathogenicity among certain individuals and demographics remain elusive. Autoantibodies have emerged as potential contributors to the severity of COVID-19. Although preliminary reports have suggested the induction of antibodies targeting Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II (ACE2) post-infection, this assertion lacks confirmation in large-scale studies. In this study, our objective is to comprehensively characterize and quantify the prevalence and expression levels of autoantibodies directed against ACE2 in a sizable cohort (n = 434). Our findings reveal that ACE2-reactive IgM antibodies are the most prevalent, with an overall seroprevalence of 18.8%, followed by IgG at 10.3% and IgA at 6.3%. Longitudinal analysis of individuals with multiple blood draws showed stable ACE2 IgG and IgA levels over time. Upon stratifying individuals based on molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 or serological evidence of past infection, no significant differences were observed between groups. Functional assessment of ACE2 autoantibodies demonstrated that they are non-neutralizing and failed to inhibit spike-ACE2 interaction or affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Our results highlight that ACE2 autoantibodies are prevalent in the general population and were not induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort. Notably, we found no substantiated evidence supporting a direct role for ACE2 autoantibodies in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Basal ganglia disease has been reported as a post-infection sequela of several viruses, with documentation of this phenomenon from the H1N1 Spanish flu to the recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.">

        <tr id="Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new viral variants has challenged public health efforts, often evading antibody responses generated by infections and vaccinations. This immune escape has led to waves of breakthrough infections, raising questions about the efficacy and durability of immune protection. Here we focus on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron spike mutations on ACE-2 receptor binding, protein stability, and immune response evasion. Delta and Omicron variants had 3–5 times higher binding affinities to ACE-2 than the ancestral strain (KDwt = 23.4 nM, KDDelta = 8.08 nM, KDBA.1 = 4.77 nM, KDBA.2 = 4.47 nM). The pattern recognition molecule mannose-binding lectin (MBL) has been shown to recognize the spike protein. Here we found that MBL binding remained largely unchanged across the variants, even after introducing mutations at single glycan sites. Although MBL binding decreased post-vaccination, it increased by 2.6-fold upon IgG depletion, suggesting a compensatory or redundant role in immune recognition. Notably, we identified two glycan sites (N717 and N801) as potentially essential for the structural integrity of the spike protein. We also evaluated the antibody and T cell responses. Neutralization by serum immunoglobulins was predominantly mediated by IgG rather than IgA and was markedly impaired against the Delta (5.8-fold decrease) and Omicron variants BA.1 (17.4-fold) and BA.2 (14.2-fold). T cell responses, initially conserved, waned rapidly within 3 months post-Omicron infection. Our data suggests that immune imprinting may have hindered antibody and T cell responses toward the variants. Overall, despite decreased antibody neutralization, MBL recognition and T cell responses were generally unaffected by the variants. These findings extend our understanding of the complex interplay between viral adaptation and immune response, underscoring the importance of considering MBL interactions, immune imprinting, and viral evolution dynamics in developing new vaccine and treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="The intricate immunological functions of human skin involve the interplay between multiple different cell types as well as dynamic trafficking of leukocytes in and out the tissue, both of which are extremely challenging to replicate in vitro. To enable in vitro investigation of human skin immunology, we developed a microfluidic human skin equivalent (HSE) that supports the delivery of circulating immune cells via a vascular microchannel embedded within the dermis of a full-thickness construct. We demonstrated that stimulation of keratinocyte inflammation with lipopolysaccharide and nigericin promoted rapid monocyte recruitment out of the vascular channel and into the epidermal layer within 24 hours, followed by a second wave of monocyte migration into the dermis over a period of six days. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the tissue-resident and recruited cell populations revealed dynamic and cell-specific patterns of gene expression that were characteristic of acute activation and resolution of an inflammatory immune response. Moreover, comparison of the gene signatures of the monocyte-derived cells to in vivo populations provided molecular level validation of the model and indicated a differentiation trajectory of the monocytes through to mature dermal macrophages. To extend the microfluidic platform to additional applications, we also modelled age-associated immune dysfunction by the inclusion of senescent fibroblasts, which promoted increased monocyte recruitment into the HSE, replicating previous in vivo human studies. Thus, the microfluidic HSE presented here replicates key aspects of dynamic inflammatory immune responses within the skin and represents a tractable experimental tool for interrogating mechanisms of human skin immunology.">

        <tr id="In the past decade, a major goal in biomedical research has been to understand why individuals differ in disease susceptibility, disease dynamics, and progression. In many pathologies, this variability stems from evolved immune mechanisms that resist inflammatory stress from various diseases that have been encountered throughout life. These may provide advantages against other diseases, reduce comorbidities, and enhance longevity. This study evaluates prior immunity as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, crucial for understanding plasmatic signaling cascades in different disease stages and their impact on disease progression. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, primarily affects the respiratory system and presents a wide range of symptoms, posing significant challenges to medicine. This study systematically analyzed prior immunity and inflammation in two independent cohorts of infected patients. A serological profile is determined by protein microarrays, which identify IgM and IgG responses against 37 prevalent microbial pathogens and provide a comprehensive plasma analysis of 21 acute-phase proteins. Our results reveal distinct serological profiles correlating with disease severity, indicating that immune system dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is linked to existing immunity. These findings highlight the relevance of prior immunity for monitoring disease progression, particularly in infections and vaccine failure, and underscore the importance of functional proteomics in determining prognostic biomarkers.">

Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid.

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly impacted global health, emphasizing the need to understand its pathogenicity and virulence mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the alveolar epithelial barrier and exacerbates airway inflammation, leading to acute respiratory failure, but the molecular details remain unclear. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurological symptoms, potentially due to its weakly understood ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The viral multifunctional Envelope (E) protein is crucial for its virulence, playing a key role in virus assembly, budding, and release. The E protein contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) that interacts with host PDZ domain-containing proteins, potentially affecting host signaling pathways and contributing to pathogenicity. This study focuses on the E protein PBM and its role in virulence, disrupting respiratory epithelial barriers and exacerbating airway inflammation. We generated recombinant mutant viruses lacking the PBM and conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments to elucidate its impact on viral fitness, pathogenicity, and effects on the epithelial integrity. In vitro, the viral mutants showed delayed replication and reduced cytopathic effects. In vivo, experiments with hamsters revealed that PBM-deficient viruses caused less weight loss, lower viral loads, and reduced inflammation, indicating decreased pathogenicity. Histological analyses confirmed less airway damage in these hamsters compared to those infected with the wild-type virus. Additionally, PBM-deficient viruses had impaired interactions with tight junction proteins like ZO-1, a PDZ-containing protein, crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Our findings also demonstrate that the PBM does not play a significant role in neuroinvasion during the acute phase of infection, as evidenced by comparable viral RNA loads across brain regions in infected hamsters, regardless of PBM presence. Histopathological and transcriptomic analyses further support this observation, suggesting that the PBM primarily affects specific epithelial barriers. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis on lung and brainstem from infected hamsters reveals that the PBM modulates inflammatory and immune responses, with a stronger impact in lung tissue than in the brainstem. PBM-deficient viruses induce lower levels of inflammation and cytokine expression, suggesting PBM’s specific role in enhancing viral pathogenicity through the activation of pathways such as NF-κB and TNF. Thus, the E protein PBM plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2’s fitness, virulence, and pathogenicity, through the disruption of cell junctions and inflammation, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Introduction Upon infection, T cell-driven B cell responses in GC reactions induce memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells that secrete protective antibodies. How formation of specifically long-lived plasma cells is regulated via the interplay between specific B and CD4+ T cells is not well understood. Generally, antibody levels decline over time after clearance of the primary infection. Method In this study, convalescent individuals with stable RBD antibody levels (n=14, “sustainers”) were compared with donors (n=13) with the greatest antibody decline from a cohort of 132. To investigate the role of the cellular immune compartment in the maintenance of antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific responses at 4 to 6 weeks post-mild COVID-19 infection were characterized using deep immune profiling. Results Both groups had similar frequencies of total SARS-CoV-2-specific B and CD4+ T cells. Sustainers had fewer Spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells early after infection and increased neutralizing capacity of RBD antibodies over time, unlike the declining group. However, declining IgG titers correlated with lower frequency of Spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Conclusion These data suggest that “sustainers” have unique dynamics of GC reactions, yield different outputs of terminally differentiating cells, and improve the quality of protective antibodies over time. This study helps identify factors controlling formation of long-lived PC and sustained antibody responses.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to a global health crisis, prompting extensive research into its pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions. One area of increasing interest is the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the complement system, a crucial component of innate immunity. This review explores the intricate relationship between COVID-19 and the complement system, shedding light on how the virus exploits and manipulates the complement components to induce inflammatory responses leading to coagulopathies. The activation of the complement pathway simultaneously activates the coagulation cascade due to the presence of common substrates of mannan-binding serine proteases of the lectin complement system in the coagulation pathway. This cross-talk between the components of the complement and coagulation system further aggravates the dysregulation of immune responses, contributing to the cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 cases. A comprehensive understanding of this crosstalk is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe disease. Understandings into the molecular mechanisms governing this interaction may pave the way for the development of novel antiviral diagnostics and therapies based on immunomodulatory interventions, offering better management for such cases.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is adapting to continuous presence in humans. Transitions to endemic infection patterns are associated with changes in the spike (S) proteins that direct virus-cell entry. These changes generate antigenic drift and thereby allow virus maintenance in the face of prevalent human antiviral antibodies. These changes also fine tune virus-cell entry dynamics in ways that optimize transmission and infection into human cells. Focusing on the latter aspect, we evaluated the effects of several S protein substitutions on virus-cell membrane fusion, an essential final step in enveloped virus-cell entry. Membrane fusion is executed by integral-membrane “S2” domains, yet we found that substitutions in peripheral “S1” domains altered late-stage fusion dynamics, consistent with S1-S2 heterodimers cooperating throughout cell entry. A specific H655Y change in S1 stabilized a fusion-intermediate S protein conformation and thereby delayed membrane fusion. The H655Y change also sensitized viruses to neutralization by S2-targeting fusion-inhibitory peptides and stem-helix antibodies. The antibodies did not interfere with early fusion-activating steps; rather they targeted the latest stages of S2-directed membrane fusion in a novel neutralization mechanism. These findings demonstrate that single amino acid substitutions in the S proteins both reset viral entry—fusion kinetics and increase sensitivity to antibody neutralization. The results exemplify how selective forces driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and antibody evasion operate together to shape SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly impacted global health, affecting not only the immediate morbidity and mortality rates but also long-term health outcomes across various populations. Although the acute effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system have initially been the primary focus, it is increasingly evident that the virus can have significant impacts on multiple physiological systems, including the nervous and immune systems. The pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between viral infection, immune aging, and brain health, that can potentially accelerate neuroimmune aging and contribute to the persistence of long COVID conditions. By inducing chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and neuroinflammation, COVID-19 may exacerbate the processes of neuroimmune aging, leading to increased risks of cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases, and impaired immune function. Key factors include chronic immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the disruption of cellular processes. These overlapping mechanisms between aging and COVID-19 illustrate how the virus can induce and accelerate aging-related processes, leading to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases and other age-related conditions. This mini-review examines key features and possible mechanisms of COVID-19-induced neuroimmune aging that may contribute to the persistence and severity of long COVID. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective interventions. Anti-inflammatory therapies, neuroprotective agents, immunomodulatory treatments, and lifestyle interventions all hold potential for mitigating the long-term effects of the virus. By addressing these challenges, we can improve health outcomes and quality of life for millions affected by the pandemic.">

The development of antiviral drugs for COVID-19 has been hampered by the requirement of a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory for experiments related to SARS-CoV-2, and by the lack of easy and precise methods for quantification of infection. Here, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 viral vector composed of all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins constitutively expressed in lentivirally transduced cells, combined with an RNA replicon deleted for SARS-CoV-2 structural protein genes S, M and E, and expressing a luciferase-GFP fusion protein. We show that, after concentrating viral stocks by ultracentrifugation, the SARS-CoV-2 viral vector is able to infect two human cell lines expressing receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Both luciferase activity and GFP fluorescence were detected, and transduction was remdesivir-sensitive. We also show that this vector is inhibited by three type I interferons (IFN-I) subtypes. Although improvements are needed to increase infectious titers, this vector system may prove useful for antiviral drug screening and SARS-CoV-2-related investigations.">

        <tr id="Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, major events with immune-modulating effects at population-level included COVID-19 infection, lockdowns, and mass vaccinations campaigns. As immune responses influence many immune-mediated diseases, population scale immunological changes may have broad consequences. Methods We investigated the impact of lockdowns, COVID-19 infection and vaccinations on immune responses in the 2000HIV study including 1895 asymptomatic virally-suppressed people living with HIV recruited between October 2019 and October 2021. Their inflammatory profile was assessed by targeted plasma proteomics, immune responsiveness by cytokine production capacity of circulating immune cells, and epigenetic profile by genome-wide DNA methylation of immune cells. Results Past mild COVID-19 infection had limited long-term immune effects. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccines and especially lockdowns significantly altered both the epigenetic profile in immune cells at DNA methylation level and immune responses. Lockdowns resulted in a strong overall exaggerated immune responsiveness, while COVID-19 vaccines moderately dampened immune responses. Lockdown-associated immune responsiveness alterations were confirmed in 30 healthy volunteers from the 200FG cohort that, like the 2000HIV study, is part of the Human Functional Genomics Project. Discussion Our data suggest that lockdowns have unforeseen immunological effects. Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines have immunological effects beyond anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and studies of their impact on non-COVID-19 immune-mediated pathology are warranted.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes the extremely infectious sickness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Globally, COVID-19 (simply, COVID) has had a terrible impact, killing more than 6 million people. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly around the globe since the first instance of this respiratory viral infection was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on 31 December 2019. Keeping given epidemiological estimates, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Post-COVID is a clinical condition characterized by the development of totally new COVID-19 symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-affected patients have been reporting a range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities which include myocardial inflammation, myocardial infarction, right ventricular dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, coronary artery atherosclerosis, focal myocardial fibrosis, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, viral myocarditis, postural orthostatic tachycardia symptom (POTS), aortic and arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, and arrhythmias. Cardiopulmonary symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, hypotension, and POTS are common and associated with significant disability and heightened anxiety. Additionally, the risk of CV side effects has also been reported with currently available COVID-19 vaccines. Pathophysiological mechanisms for post-COVID cardiac complications are still poorly understood. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiac diseases which are abundant in those at risk of severe disease. This review discusses the definition of post-COVID complications, pathophysiological mechanisms of underlying acute and chronic CV injury, and their impact post-COVID-19 on multiorgan health.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease marked by the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies and a lack of tolerance to nuclear self-antigens. Hypocomple-mentemia, or an abnormal blood complement deficit, is a reliable predictor of infection in SLE patients. Moreover, it has been found that immunoglobulin (Ig), particularly IgG and IgM, is lowered in SLE patients, which may be a factor in their heightened susceptibility to infection. Bloodstream autoantibodies, lymphopenia, aberrant T cells, proinflammatory cytokines, and impaired regulatory systems all lead to an immune response that is aberrant in lupus patients. SLE patients exhibit impaired CD8 T cell responses, including abnormal phagocytosis and chemotaxis. Recent study has shown that COVID-19 infections significantly boost type I inter-feron responses. Patients with SLE and Covid-19 infection typically get immune-suppressing drugs viz corticosteroids, Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK), and tocilizumab, which improve their immune systems and diminution susceptible to Covid-19 infections.">

        <tr id="Genome-wide association studies performed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have uncovered various loci significantly associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity. However, the underlying cis-regulatory genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their impact on clinical phenotypes remain enigmatic. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underscore the importance of expanding the study of regulatory variation to relevant cell types and disease contexts and argue for the existence of extensive gene-environment effects among patients responding to an infection.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 (LC) is a poorly understood, multifactorial condition that persists for at least three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the wide range of associated symptoms—including fatigue, brain fog, and respiratory issues—remain unclear. However, emerging evidence suggests that the reactivation of latent viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus, may significantly contribute to the complexity of LC. These latent viruses can be reactivated by SARS-CoV-2, contributing to a chronic inflammatory state that prolongs symptomatology. This review confirms the potential involvement of latent viral infections in LC and examines whether these infections play an independent role or act synergistically with other factors. In addition, recent studies have highlighted viral persistence and immune dysregulation as key elements in LC. Our findings suggest that preventative strategies, including vaccination and antiviral treatments during the acute phase of COVID-19, show potential in reducing LC risk by preventing viral reactivation. However, tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting these latent infections are urgently needed. Identifying biomarkers of viral reactivation, particularly for high-risk populations, could be considered another effective strategy to mitigate LC severity. Further research is crucial to better understand the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and latent infections, and to improve the prevention and treatment of LC.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is characterized by systemic pro-inflammatory shifts with the development of serious alterations in the functioning of the immune system. Investigations of the gene expression changes accompanying the infection state provide insight into the molecular and cellular processes depending on the sickness severity and virus variants. Severe Delta COVID-19 has been characterized by the appearance of a monocyte subset enriched for proinflammatory gene expression signatures and a shift in ligand–receptor interactions. We profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of 140,000 nuclei in PBMC samples from healthy individuals or individuals with COVID-19. We investigated cis-regulatory elements and identified the core transcription factors governing gene expression in immune cells during COVID-19 infection. In severe cases, we discovered that regulome and chromatin co-accessibility modules were significantly altered across many cell types. Moreover, cases with the Delta variant were accompanied by a specific monocyte subtype discovered using scATAC-seq data. Our analysis showed that immune cells of individuals with severe Delta COVID-19 underwent significant remodeling of the chromatin accessibility landscape and development of the proinflammatory expression pattern. Using a gene regulatory network modeling approach, we investigated the core transcription factors governing the cell state and identified the most pronounced chromatin changes in CD14+ monocytes from individuals with severe Delta COVID-19. Together, our results provide novel insights into cis-regulatory module organization and its impact on gene activity in immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and risk of long COVID has been associated with the depletion or over-abundance of specific taxa within the gut microbiome. However, the microbial mechanisms mediating these effects are not yet known. We hypothesized that altered microbial production of tryptophan and its downstream derivatives might contribute to inappropriate immune responses to viral infection. In patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 172), serum levels of tryptophan and indole-3-propionate (IPA) negatively correlated with serum levels of many proinflammatory mediators (including C-reactive protein and Serum amyloid A), while C-glycosyltryptophan (C-Trp), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were positively correlated with levels of acute phase proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, alarmins and chemokines. A similar pattern was observed in long COVID patients (n = 20) where tryptophan and IPA were negatively associated with a large number of serum cytokines, while C-Trp and IAA were positively associated with circulating cytokine levels. Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota showed the relative abundance of genes encoding the microbial enzymes required for tryptophan production (e.g. anthranilate synthase) and microbial tryptophan metabolism was significantly lower in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 380) compared to healthy controls (n = 270). Microbial tryptophan metabolites reduced innate cell proinflammatory responses to cytosolic DNA sensor Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 and TLR-4 stimulation in vitro, while IL-10 secretion was enhanced. Microbial tryptophan metabolites also modified ex vivo human lymphocyte responses by limiting the production of TH1 and TH17 associated cytokines, while enhancing secretion of IL-22. These data suggest that lower levels of tryptophan production and tryptophan metabolism by gut microbes may increase the risk of severe and chronic outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to impaired innate and adaptive responses to infection. Screening patients for lower-level microbiome capacity for tryptophan metabolism may help identify at-risk individuals.">

        <tr id="During the past decade (and beyond), neurologists have become aware of the emergence, persistence, and consequences of some familiar and new infections affecting the nervous system. Even among the familiar CNS infections, such as herpes virus, polyoma virus/JC, influenza, arbovirus, and hepatitis, challenges remain in developing effective antiviral treatments and treatments of postinfection sequelae. With the changing environment and increased global travel, arthropod vectors that mediate zoonotic disease transmission have spread unfamiliar viruses such as West Nile virus, dengue, chikungunya, equine encephalitis, and Zika, among others. Although the global health impact of these diseases has not risen to that of COVID-19 and HIV, it is likely to dramatically increase with continued spread of transmission vectors and the emergence of new zoonotic animal-to-human diseases mediated by those transmission vectors. Furthermore, specific virus-targeting treatments or effective vaccines for arboviral infections are not yet available, and this represents a major challenge in limiting the morbidity of these infections. By contrast, HIV-1, a disease that originated by direct transmission from nonhuman primates to humans (as early as the 1930s), after many years of intense study, is now targeted by highly specific and effective antiviral drugs that can limit the spread of infection and extend human life and health in all populations. Even with these dramatic therapeutic effects of suppressing HIV replication, neurologic dysfunction (primarily cognitive impairment) affects significant numbers of persons living with HIV. This emphasizes not only the importance of treating the underlying infection but also developing treatments for legacy effects of the initial infection even after antiviral therapy. Notably, the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was met with rapid implementation of highly effective and specific antiviral therapies. This resulted in early and dramatic lowering of the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, the postinfectious complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection (long COVID) are now among the more costly consequences of emerging zoonotic infections worldwide. Developing new antiviral therapies that can penetrate the CNS, vaccines, and therapies that target host immune responses and metabolic dysfunction will be necessary for management of infectious and postinfectious complications of established and emerging infections.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to an unprecedented global health crisis. While primarily recognized for its respiratory implications, the virus has shown a significant affinity for the nervous system, resulting in a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations. This literature review explores the intersection of neurology and virology, focusing on the acute and long-term neurological effects of COVID-19.
Methods: A comprehensive review of current literature was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Relevant studies were selected based on their focus on the pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and long-term neurological outcomes of COVID-19. Special attention was given to peer-reviewed articles, meta-analyses, and clinical case reports published between 2019 and 2024.
Results: The review identifies multiple mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 invades the nervous system, including direct viral entry and systemic inflammation. Acute neurological manifestations include encephalitis, stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, while long-term sequelae encompass cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, and psychiatric disorders. The findings underscore the complexity of COVID-19’s impact on the nervous system, with both immediate and enduring effects.
Conclusion: Neuro-COVID represents a significant and evolving challenge in the context of the pandemic. Understanding the neurological implications of COVID-19 is crucial for improving patient outcomes and guiding future research. This review underscores the need for heightened clinical awareness and a multidisciplinary approach to effectively address the complex neuro-COVID spectrum.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids. SUMMARY The neurotropic Usutu virus can cause encephalitis driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment, microglia activation and blood-brain barrier disruption, all of which are inhibited by glucocorticoid treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a significant global public health challenge. While respiratory symptoms dominate, the virus's impact on other systems, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), has gained increasing attention. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates tropism for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, expressed in the olfactory epithelium, lungs, endothelium, kidneys, enterocytes, and neurons, contributing to neurological manifestations observed during the acute phase of the disease.  
Materials and Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. Keywords included: COVID-19, Post Acute COVID-19 Syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 Virus, Neurological Manifestations, and Central Nervous System Viral Diseases. A total of 58 articles were selected for analysis based on relevance and quality of evidence regarding neurological symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19.  
Basic Results: The acute phase of COVID-19 frequently involves neurological symptoms such as frontal and holocranial headaches, dizziness, gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, and alterations in consciousness. Severe complications, though less common, include encephalitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and myelitis. These conditions often present as altered mental status, seizures, aphasia, headaches, or focal deficits, contributing substantially to patient morbidity and mortality.  
Conclusions: Neurological symptoms and complications constitute a significant aspect of COVID-19, highlighting the virus's potential to affect the CNS. While severe complications are rare, their profound impact on prognosis underscores the importance of early recognition and management. Further research is essential to understand the pathophysiology and optimise therapeutic approaches for affected patients. ">

        <tr id="Aberrant and sustained activation of microglia is implicated in the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether intrinsic alterations in microglial function impact the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. We conducted transcriptomic and functional analyses of microglia-like cells (iMGLs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MS (pwMS) to answer this question. We generated iPSCs from six pwMS showing increased microglial activity via translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging. We demonstrated that the differentiated iMGL transcriptional profile resembled the microglial signature found in MS lesions. Importantly, compared with healthy controls, MS iMGLs presented cell-autonomous differences in their regulation of inflammation, both in the basal state and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide challenge. Through transcriptomic profiling, we showed that MS iMGLs display increased expression of genes known to be upregulated in MS microglia. Furthermore, upregulated genes in MS iMGLs were associated with immune receptor activation, antigen presentation, and the complement system, with known MS implications. Finally, functional analyses indicated that the transcriptional changes in MS iMGLs corresponded with alterations in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased phagocytosis. Together, our results provide evidence of putative cell-autonomous microglial activation in pwMS and identify transcriptomic and functional changes that recapitulate the phenotypes observed in vivo in microglia from pwMS. These findings indicate that MS disease-specific iPSCs are valuable tools for studying disease-specific microglial activation in vitro and highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets in MS.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Emerging research indicates that autophagy, a cellular degradation process, may be triggered by certain immune responses, including those by vaccines. This study aims to examine whether the SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines, known to induce robust immune activation, can trigger autophagic pathways that facilitate the degradation of amyloid‐beta (Aβ), a pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). By applying deep learning techniques to analyze complex immunological and neurological data, this study explores a potentially innovative therapeutic strategy for AD. Method In this study, we conducted a focused cohort involving 1,200 early to mid‐stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients who received the SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine, along with 1,200 matched controls who did not receive vaccination. Over a period of 24 months, we gathered and analyzed extensive datasets, which included genomic information related to autophagy‐related genes, longitudinal blood biomarker profiles emphasizing autophagy and amyloid‐beta (Aβ) markers, and detailed brain imaging data for quantifying Aβ deposition and brain morphology changes. Our analysis utilized deep learning models, specifically designed to process sequential and spatial data, to identify patterns that correlate vaccine response with changes in autophagic activity and Aβ levels. Result Preliminary analysis revealed that vaccinated AD patients exhibited a 24% increase in markers of autophagic activity (95% CI: 20%‐28%, p<0.001) and a corresponding 22% reduction in soluble Aβ levels (95% CI: 18%‐26%, p<0.001) compared to baseline and control groups. Cognitive assessments showed a deceleration in cognitive decline in the vaccinated group, with a statistically significant difference in the annual decrease in MMSE scores by 1.1 points (95% CI: 0.7‐1.5, p<0.001) relative to unvaccinated patients. Deep learning models identified a predictive interaction between specific autophagy‐related genetic variants and vaccine response, indicating higher efficacy in certain subgroups. Conclusion The study suggests that SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination may improve autophagy in Alzheimer’s brains, aiding in amyloid‐beta breakdown. This has implications for treating Alzheimer’s and potentially other neurological conditions with vaccines or immunotherapies targeting autophagy.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a significant threat to global public health. Immunopathological damage plays a role in driving pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure in severe COVID-19. Therefore, dissecting the pulmonary immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to understand disease pathogenesis and identify immune pathways targetable by therapeutic intervention. Considering that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 enhances COVID-19 disease severity, therapeutic targeting of upstream signals that drive type 2 immunity may confer further protection. In this study, we investigate the role of the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis, a potent inducer of type 2 immunity in the lung, in a mouse model of COVID-19. Upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10, ST2-/- mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (69.2% vs 13.3% survival; P = 0.0005), as compared to wild-type mice. In a complementary pharmacologic approach, IL-33/ST2 signaling was inhibited using HpBARI_Hom2, a helminth derived protein that binds to mouse ST2 and blocks IL-33 signaling. In SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (60% vs 10% survival; P = 0.0035), as compared to inert control-treated mice. These data demonstrate that loss of IL-33/ST2 signaling confers protection during acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, implicating the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis as an enhancer of COVID-19 disease severity. The protection conferred by pharmacologic blockade of IL-33/ST2 signaling was independent of viral control, as HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had no reduction in viral titers. This finding suggests an immunopathogenic role for IL-33/ST2 signaling. One potential mechanism through which IL-33/ST2 signaling may drive severe disease is through enhancement of type 2 immune pathways including IL-5 production, as pulmonary IL-5 concentrations were found to depend on IL-33/ST2 signaling in acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as a global pandemic pathogen with high mortality. While treatments have been developed to reduce morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, more antivirals with broad-spectrum activities are still needed. Here, we identified lonafarnib (LNF), a Food and Drug Administration–approved inhibitor of cellular farnesyltransferase (FTase), as an effective anti–SARS-CoV-2 agent. LNF inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and acted synergistically with known anti-SARS antivirals. LNF was equally active against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants. Mechanistic studies suggested that LNF targeted multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Using other structurally diverse FTase inhibitors and a LNF-resistant FTase mutant, we demonstrated a key role of FTase in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. To demonstrate in vivo efficacy, we infected SARS-CoV-2–susceptible humanized mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and treated them with LNF. LNF at a clinically relevant dose suppressed the viral titer in the respiratory tract and improved pulmonary pathology and clinical parameters. Our study demonstrated that LNF, an approved oral drug with excellent human safety data, is a promising antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that warrants further clinical assessment for treatment of COVID-19 and potentially other viral infections.">

        <tr id="Monocytes are essential for replenishing homeostatic macrophages in the intestine. However, they also accumulate in significant numbers when intestinal homeostasis is disrupted in diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The molecular pathways governing monocyte behaviour across these different contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of monocytes that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs). These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate increased expression of IBD susceptibility genes. By performing cross-species analysis, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis in mice. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete precursor in the bone marrow (BM) and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans. Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production. Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health.">

        <tr id="AdCLD-CoV19-1, a chimeric adenovirus-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine, was previously reported to elicit robust antibody responses in mice and non-human primates after a single dose. In this study, we conducted a systems serology analysis to investigate changes in humoral immune responses induced by varying doses of the AdCLD-CoV19-1 vaccine in a phase I clinical trial. Serum samples from participants receiving either a low or a high dose of the vaccine were analyzed for antibody features against prototype SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) domains (full-length S, S1, S2, and receptor binding domain), as well as Fc receptor binding and effector functions. While both low- and high-dose vaccines induced robust humoral immune responses following vaccination, the quality of antibody features differed between the dose groups. Notably, while no significant difference was observed between the groups in the induction of most S1-specific antibody features, the high-dose group exhibited higher levels of antibodies and a stronger Fc receptor binding response specific to the S2 antigen. Moreover, univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the high-dose vaccine induced higher levels of S2-specific antibodies binding to FcγR2A and FcγR3B, closely associated with antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP). Further analysis using the Omicron BA.2 variant demonstrated that the high-dose group maintained significantly higher levels of IgG and FcγR3B binding to the S2 antigen and exhibited a significantly higher ADNP response for the S2 antigen compared with the low-dose group. These findings underscore the importance of considering diverse humoral immune responses when evaluating vaccine efficacy and provide insights for optimizing adenovirus vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses.IMPORTANCEOptimization of vaccine dose is crucial for eliciting effective immune responses. In addition to neutralizing antibodies, non-neutralizing antibodies that mediate Fc-dependent effector functions play a key role in protection against various infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019. Using a systems serology approach, we demonstrated significant dose-dependent differences in the humoral immune responses induced by the AdCLD-CoV19-1 chimeric adenovirus-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine, particularly against the SARS-CoV-2 spike 2 domain. These findings highlight the importance of assessing not only neutralizing antibody titers but also the quality and functionality of antibody responses when evaluating vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Many common symptoms in post-acute sequelae following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) overlap with those of multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined symptoms and performance of the PASC score, developed in the general population, in MS based on infection history.


METHODS
We surveyed North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry participants regarding infections and categorized participants based on infection history. Symptoms experienced before, during, and after infection were used to identify persistent new symptoms. PASC was defined as a score ⩾ 12 based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study RECOVER.


RESULTS
Of 4787 participants surveyed, 2927 were included: 294 (10%) having recent COVID-19; 853 (29.1%) recent non-COVID-19 infection; 246 (8.4%) recent COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infection; 1534 (52.4%) uninfected, defined as never having COVID-19 nor any infection within the past 6 months. Compared to those uninfected, infection groups reported at least a two-fold increase in fever, cough, loss of smell/taste, and shortness of breath. Based on persistent new symptoms, PASC was identified in only 1.5% of participants with COVID-19.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests lower than expected prevalence of PASC in MS and a complex association between infections and development of new persistent symptoms following infections. The similar proportions classified with PASC across infection groups shows that symptoms of PASC are common and complicate assessment of PASC in MS.">

Macrophage inflammatory responses impact COVID-19 severity; however, it is unclear whether macrophages are infected by SARS-CoV-2. We sought to identify mechanisms regulating macrophage expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and to determine if macrophages are susceptible to productive infection. We developed a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mouse whereby hACE2 cDNA was cloned into the mouse ACE2 locus under control of the native promoter. We validated susceptibility of hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to wild-type mice and an established K18-hACE2 model of acute fulminating disease. Intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 led to pulmonary consolidations with cellular infiltrate, edema, and hemorrhage, consistent with pneumonia, yet unlike the K18-hACE2 model, hACE2 mice survived and maintained stable weight. Infected hACE2 mice also exhibited a unique plasma chemokine, cytokine, and growth factor inflammatory signature relative to K18-hACE2 mice. Infected hACE2 mice demonstrated evidence of viral replication in infiltrating lung macrophages, and infection of macrophages in vitro revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of altered RNA and ribosomal processing machinery as well as activated cellular antiviral defense. Macrophage IL-1β-driven NF-κB transcription of ACE2 was an important mechanism of dynamic ACE2 upregulation, promoting macrophage susceptibility to infection. Experimental models of COVID-19 that make use of native hACE2 expression will allow for mechanistic insight into factors that can either promote host resilience or increase susceptibility to worsening severity of infection.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is central to temporal lobe epilepsy, yet the specific role of myeloid cells remains unclear. In status epilepticus (SE) models, circulating monocytes have been reported to infiltrate the brain, though distinguishing them from microglia remains challenging. Using a rat model, we traced infiltrating monocytes post-SE, to investigate their persistence, phenotypic evolution during epileptogenesis and contribution to neuroinflammation. By tracking phagocyted fluorescent nanoparticles and using CD68 immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that monocytes entered the brain in significant numbers 24 hours post-SE, after the inflammatory peak occurred (7h post-SE). Tracked up to 7 weeks, these cells adopted a microglia-like phenotype, contributed to the microglial scar and sustained low-grade inflammation during the chronic phase of epilepsy solely through their presence, as their expression of pro-inflammatory markers resembled that of non-activated microglia. Importantly, monocytes initially and transiently supported an anti-inflammatory response providing a unique opportunity to modulate neuroinflammation and potentially disrupt epilepsy progression, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Introduction Long COVID is a debilitating condition that lasts for more than three months post-infection by SARS–CoV–2. On average, one in ten individuals infected with SARS CoV- 2 develops Long COVID worldwide. A knowledge gap exists in our understanding of the mechanisms, genetic risk factors, and biomarkers that could be associated with Long COVID. Methods In this pilot study we used RNA-Seq to quantify the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from COVID-recovered individuals, seven with and seven without Long COVID symptoms (age- and sex-matched individuals), on average 6 months after infection. Results Seventy genes were identified as significantly up- or down-regulated in Long COVID samples, and the vast majority were downregulated. The most significantly up- or downregulated genes fell into two main categories, either associated with cell survival or with inflammation. This included genes such as ICOS (FDR p = 0.024) and S1PR1 (FDR p = 0.019) that were both up-regulated, indicating that a pro-inflammatory state is sustained in Long COVID PBMCs compared with COVID recovered PBMCs. Functional enrichment analysis identified that immune-related functions were expectedly predominant among the up- or down-regulated genes. The most frequently downregulated genes in significantly altered functional categories were two leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptors LILRB1 (FDR p = 0.005) and LILRB2 (FDR p = 0.027). PCA analysis demonstrated that LILRB1 and LILRB2 expression discriminated all of the Long COVID samples from COVID recovered samples. Discussion Downregulation of these inhibitory receptors similarly indicates a sustained pro-inflammatory state in Long COVID PBMCs. LILRB1 and LILRB2 should be validated as prospective biomarkers of Long COVID in larger cohorts, over time and against clinically overlapping conditions.">

Most individuals with acute COVID-19 developed SARS2-specific T cell responses within 6 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Early CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were polyfunctional, and both strongly associated with reduced upper respiratory tract SARS2 viral RNA, independent of neutralizing antibody titers.

However, gain-of-function mutations of NLRC4 are linked to severe autoinflammatory diseases, including autoinflammation with infantile enterocolitis (AIFEC). Existing mouse models do not adequately replicate the chronic, unprovoked inflammation observed in AIFEC patients. In this study, we developed a loxP-flanked NLRC4 V341A knock-in (KI) mouse model. Our global NLRC4 V341A KI mice exhibited symptoms closely mirroring those of human AIFEC. These mice demonstrated severe infantile enterocolitis, characterized by heightened intestinal inflammation, compromised intestinal barrier integrity, disrupted gut epithelium, and severe diarrhea, with high mortality within 10 days postnatally. Additionally, they displayed systemic autoinflammation marked by elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-6, alongside cytopenia and hemophagocytosis. In contrast, adult NLRC4 conditional KI mice exhibited autoinflammation with only mild enterocolitis. Since AIFEC is characterized by life-threatening enterocolitis in infancy and recurrent severe autoinflammation throughout life, our conditional NLRC4 KI model effectively recapitulates the clinical features of human AIFEC. Moreover, the NLRC4 V341A-mediated monogenic infantile enterocolitis observed in our model resembles infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), positioning it as a valuable platform for research on very early-onset IBD.">

        <tr id="Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and long-term complications in bone health. Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces bone turnover and promotes bone loss, but the mechanism underlying worsened bone health remains elusive. This study sought to identify specific immune mediators that exacerbated preexisting IMIDs after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Plasma samples from 4 groups were analyzed: healthy, IMID only, COVID-19 only, and COVID-19 + IMID. Using high-throughput multiplexed proteomics, we profiled 1,500 protein biomarkers and identified 148 unique biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with IMIDs, including elevated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17F) and bone resorption markers. Long-term circulating SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, a virulence factor for COVID-19, was detected in the COVID + IMID group. RA was one of the most common IMIDs in our study. ORF8 treatment of RA-derived human osteoblasts (RA-hOBs) increased levels of inflammatory (TNF, IL6, CCL2) and bone resorption (RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio) markers compared with healthy controls. Supernatants from ORF8-treated RA-hOBs drove the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast-like cells.

        <tr id="Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Despite the crucial role of aberrant immune responses in ALS pathogenesis, studies investigating immunological profiles in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with ALS have reported inconsistent findings. Herein, we explored the intrathecal adaptive immune response and features of circulating T cells between CSF and blood of patients with ALS using single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. This study comprised a total of 11 patients with apparently sporadic ALS and three controls with non-inflammatory diseases. We collected CSF from all participants, and for three patients with ALS, we additionally obtained paired samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Utilizing droplet-based single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing, we analysed immunological profiles, gene expression characteristics and clonality. Furthermore, we examined T-cell characteristics in both PBMC and CSF samples, evaluating the shared T-cell clones across these compartments. In the CSF, patients with ALS exhibited a lower proportion of CD4+ T cells (45.2 versus 61.2%, P = 0.005) and a higher proportion of CD8+ GZMKhi effector memory T cells (TEMs) than controls (21.7 versus 16.8%, P = 0.060). Higher clonality was observed in CD8+ TEMs in patients with ALS compared with controls. In addition, CSF macrophages of patients with ALS exhibited a significant increase in chemokines recruiting CD8+ TEMs. Immunohistochemical analysis showed slightly higher proportions of T cells in the perivascular and parenchymal spaces in patients with ALS than in controls, and CD8+ TEMs co-localized with neurons or astrocytes in the motor cortices of patients with ALS. Clonally expanded CD8+ GZMKhi TEMs primarily comprised shared T-cell clones between CSF and PBMCs. Moreover, the shared CD8+ TEMs of PBMCs exhibited gene expression profiles similar to CSF T cells. Patients with ALS showed an increase in proportion and clonality of CD8+ GZMKhi TEMs and activated features of macrophages in CSF. The shared T-cell clone between CSF and blood was mainly composed of expanded CD8+ GZMKhi TEMs. In conclusion, single-cell immune profiling provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of ALS, characterized by activated macrophages and clonally expanded CD8+ T cells potentially communicating with the central nervous system and peripheral circulation.">

        <tr id="Human immune systems are highly variable, with most variation attributable to non-genetic sources. The gut microbiome crucially shapes the immune system; however, its relationship with the baseline immune states of healthy humans remains incompletely understood. Therefore, we performed multi-omic profiling of 110 healthy participants through the ImmunoMicrobiome study. A factor-based integrative approach identified coordinated variation, revealing that the tonic interferon response was amongst the most variable immune features in healthy participants. Microbiome composition, pathways, and stool metabolites varied concomitantly with interferon response pathways. Distinct transcriptional programs involving inflammation and TGF-β in SIGLEC-1high monocytes and CD69high activated MAIT and NK cells were representative of these programs. Our study provides extensive data to examine the relationship between the immune states and microbiomes of healthy individuals at steady state, which paves the way for delineating inter-individual differences relevant for disease susceptibility and responses to therapy.">

The first part of the review summarizes the contributions of critical immune cell populations such as microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells in mediating inflammation and metabolism in CNS disorders. The remainder of the review addresses the impact of metabolic changes on immune cell activation and disease progression in brain aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, we also address the therapeutic potential of targeting immunometabolic pathways to reduce neuroinflammation and slow disease progression.

        <tr id="Advanced age increases the risk of severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as incidence of long COVID and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We hypothesized that perturbations in the aged antiviral CD8+ T cell response predisposes elderly individuals to severe coronavirus infection, re-infection, and postinfectious cognitive sequelae. Using MHV-A59 as a murine model of respiratory coronavirus, we found that aging increased CNS infection and lethality to MHV infection. This was coupled with increased CD8+ T cells within the aged CNS but reduced antigen specificity. Aged animals also displayed a decreased proportion of CD103+ resident memory cells (TRM), which correlated with increased severity of secondary viral challenge. Using a reciprocal adoptive transfer paradigm, data show that not only were fewer aged CD8+ T cells retained within the adult brain post-infection, but also that adult CD8+ cells expressed lower levels of TRM marker CD103 when in the aged microenvironment. Furthermore, aged animals demonstrated spatial learning impairment following MHV infection, which worsened in both aged and adult animals following secondary viral challenge. Spatial learning impairment was accompanied by increased TUNEL positivity in hippocampal neurons, suggestive of neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, primary cell coculture showed that activated CD8+ T cells induced TUNEL positivity in neurons, independent of antigen-specificity. Altogether, these results show that non-antigen specific CD8+ T cells are recruited to the aged brain and cause broad neuronal death without establishing a TRM phenotype that confers lasting protection against a secondary infection.">

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, represents a significant and complex health challenge with a wide range of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the emerging evidence suggesting a critical role of the gut and gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of Long COVID. It explores how changes in the gut microbiome, disruption of gut barrier integrity, and the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens within the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to the prolonged and varied symptoms seen in Long COVID, including chronic inflammation and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The review also summarizes key insights gained about Long COVID, highlighting its multifactorial nature, which involves immune dysregulation, microvascular damage, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, with the gut playing a central role in these processes. While progress has been made in understanding these mechanisms, current evidence remains inconclusive. The challenges of establishing causality, standardizing research methodologies, and addressing individual variations in the microbiome are discussed, emphasizing the need for further longitudinal studies and more comprehensive approaches to enhance our understanding of these complex interactions. This review underscores the importance of personalized approaches in developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Long COVID, while also acknowledging the significant gaps in our current understanding. Future research should aim to further unravel the complex interplay between the gut and Long COVID, ultimately improving outcomes for those affected by this condition.">

        <tr id="Background
Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary, ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia, and other serious complications. Some populations have been observed to be at higher risk for severe disease and death compared to other ethnical groups.


Objective
To evaluate two parameters of the innate immune system, that play a significant role in viral immunity.


Methods
In samples of peripheral blood from sixteen patients with severe COVID-19, ten with asymptomatic to mild illness, and fifteen healthy subjects, the percentage of NK and NKT cells, the expression of different NK cell receptors and the blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were tested.


Results
We observed that patients with severe COVID-19 showed significantly lower frequencies of both CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells compared to patients with mild illness or healthy controls. Furthermore, patients with severe manifestation of COVID-19 exhibited an aberrant expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46. Similarly, NK cells from these patients showed statistically significant differences in the expression of various killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in the two main cell subsets (CD56bright, CD56dim) compared to controls or patients with mild disease. Moreover, patients with severe illness displayed decreased frequency of NKT cells (defined as CD3+CD56+) and elevated blood levels of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.


Conclusion
This study suggests that the abnormal features of NK and NKT cells observed in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may play an important role in the outcome of this infectious disease in various population groups.">

The immunological profiles of volunteers residing in endemic and non-endemic areas for chronic infectious diseases were analyzed at early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A unique signature of inflammatory plasma mediators was identified in COVID-19 volunteers when compared to individuals with other flu-like syndromes. COVID-19 severity correlated with high levels of inflammatory mediators; among them, CXCL9, a serum marker of aging. Patients who progressed to hospitalization displayed high frequencies of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing exhaustion and senescence markers and showed reduced and more mature B cell repertoires, which are typical of senescence. They also had an acceleration of epigenetic age measured by DNA methylation. Therefore, severe COVID-19 correlated with phenotypic, functional, and epigenetic features of accelerated immunosenescence at onset of infection.">

        <tr id="Acute COVID-19 infection causes significant alterations in the innate and adaptive immune systems. While most individuals recover naturally, some develop long COVID (LC) syndrome, marked by persistent or new symptoms weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, there are no clinical tests to distinguish LC patients from those fully recovered. Understanding the immunological basis of LC is essential for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches.We performed deep immunophenotyping and functional assays to examine the immunological profiles of LC patients, individuals with active COVID-19, recovered patients, and healthy donors. This analysis assessed both innate and adaptive immune features, identifying potential biomarkers for LC syndrome. A Binomial Generalized Linear Model (BGLM) was used to pinpoint immune features characterizing LC.COVID-19 patients exhibited depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes, and monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells. Elevated basal inflammation was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to LC patients, whose immune profiles were closer to those of healthy donors and recovered individuals. However, LC patients displayed persistent immune alterations, including reduced T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Tregs) and switched memory B cells, similar to COVID-19 patients. Through BGLM, a unique adaptive immune signature for LC was identified, featuring memory CD8 and gd T cells with low proliferative capacity and diminished expression of activation and homing receptors.The findings highlight a unique immunological signature associated with LC syndrome, characterized by persistent adaptive immune dysregulation. While LC patients displayed recovery in innate immune profiles comparable to healthy and Recovered individuals, deficits in T cell and memory B cell populations were evident, differentiating LC from full recovery. These findings provide insights into LC pathogenesis and may support the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Background Several years after the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of trained immunity in COVID-19 remains controversial, and questions regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19 on immune cells remain unresolved. We investigated the roles of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination and latent infections in the progression of COVID-19 and sepsis. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of 97 individuals recovering from mild-to-critical COVID-19 and 64 sepsis patients. Immune cell frequencies, expression of functional markers, and plasma titres of anti-Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies were assessed and their impact on disease severity and outcomes were determined. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS. Results Post COVID-19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterized mainly by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post-critical COVID-19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. Additionally, a higher frequency of CMV and T. gondii seropositive-alongside a lower frequency of BCG seropositive-patients were associated with severe and critical COVID-19. However, the monocyte response to stimulation was unaffected by the severity of COVID-19. Conclusion These findings highlight the long-term alterations of immune cells in post-COVID-19 patients emphasizing the substantial impact of COVID-19 on immune function. However, our data showed no relationship between previous BCG vaccination and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) are critical for neuronal support functions, including myelination and remyelination. Emerging evidence reveals their active roles in neuroinflammation, particularly in conditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study explores the inflammatory translatome of OLCs during the early onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an established MS model. Using RiboTag-based RNA sequencing in genetically modified Olig2-Cre RiboTag mice, we identified 1,556 upregulated and 683 downregulated genes in EAE OLCs. Enrichment analysis indicated heightened immune-related pathways, such as cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and antigen presentation, while downregulated genes were linked to neuronal development and myelination. Notably, OLCs expressed cytokines/chemokines, and their receptor, highlighting their active involvement in neuroinflammatory signaling. Functional studies demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling in OLCs exacerbates EAE pathology by enhancing antigen presentation and chemokine production, whereas interferon-beta (IFN-β) signaling showed minimal impact. These findings provide novel insights into the inflammatory role of OLCs in EAE and suggest therapeutic potential in targeting OLC-mediated neuroinflammation for MS and related disorders.">

        <tr id="Acute lung injury (ALI), diagnosed clinically as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), refers to a spectrum of acute inflammatory processes culminating in increased permeability of the pulmonary alveolar–capillary barrier and impaired gas exchange. The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has raised questions as to the similarities and differences between COVID-19 lung injury and ALI of other etiologies. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of ALI and COVID-19 lung injury and draws comparisons between the latter and other infectious etiologies of ALI. Indeed, severe COVID-19 is characterized by a unique array of disease mechanisms including suppression of interferon responses, widespread inflammasome activation, altered leukocyte phenotypes, and hyperactive thrombotic activity. Moreover, these mechanisms manifest as a unique clinical progression, which further differentiates COVID-19 from other viral respiratory pathogens such as SARS, MERS, and influenza. These unique features of COVID-19 pathophysiology bear important implications for current and future therapeutic strategies.">

Cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of mortality following infection. In this review, we discuss immune pathogenesis and four medications, including Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Dexamethasone, and Annual SZ for COVID-19. A comparison of the effectiveness and therapeutic usage of drugs as reported in clinical trials and reports was made at different disease levels as well. Clinical studies indicate that Annual SZ with mild side effects was more affordable and might be more effective than other medications. Additionally, Annual SZ was capable of reducing the lev-els of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as viral attachment and RNA replication.">

        <tr id="Abstract Some of the millions of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have developed new sequelae after recovering from the initial disease, termed post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (PASC). One symptom is anxiety, which is likely due to three etiologies: brain structural changes, neuroendocrine disruption, and neurotransmitter alterations. This review provides an overview of the current literature on the pathophysiological pathways linking coronavirus disease 2019 to anxiety, as well as the possible mechanisms of action in which an increasingly scrutinized treatment method, enhanced external counter-pulsation (EECP), is able to alleviate anxiety. SARS-CoV-2 triggers increased inflammatory cytokine production, as well as oxidative stress; these processes contribute to the aforementioned three etiologies. The potential treatment approach of EECP, involving sequenced inflation and deflation of specifically-placed airbags, has become of increasing interest, as it has been found to alleviate PASC-associated anxiety by improving patient cardiovascular function. These functional improvements were achieved by EECP stimulating anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic processes, as well as improving endothelial cell function and coronary blood flow, partially via counteracting against the negative effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Therefore, EECP could promote both psychosomatic and cardiac rehabilitation. Further research, though, is still needed to fully determine its benefits and mechanism of action.">

Here, we show that multiple stages of iPD, including the pre-motor prodromal stage, can be stratified according to the inflammatory and immunometabolic responses to stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ex vivo. We identified increased stimulation-dependent secretion of TNF, IL-1β, and IL-8 in monocytes from RBD patients and showed diminished proinflammatory cytokine secretion in monocytes and T cells in early and moderate stages of PD. Mechanistically, immune activation revealed deficits in CD8+ T-cell mitochondrial health in moderate PD, and relative mitochondrial health in CD8+ T cells was positively correlated with stimulation-dependent T-cell cytokine secretion across the PD spectrum. Dysregulated immunometabolism may drive peripheral inflammation and PD progression, and ex vivo stimulation-based assays have potential to reveal novel biomarkers for patient stratification and progression with immune endophenotypes.">

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes have been implicated as central mediators of neuroinflammatory processes in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory roles and interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a compartmentalized microfluidic chip coculture platform. This novel platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of fluidically isolated microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 hours. The glial activation and crosstalk were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were successfully generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic chip platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Notably, the levels of secreted inflammatory mediators were altered under coculture conditions, revealing significant glial crosstalk. Utilization of our microfluidic coculture platform facilitated the study of microglial migration and glial activation within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Microglia migrated efficiently toward the astrocyte compartment, and the chemoattractant adenosine diphosphate (ADP) notably increased microglial migration within this platform. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation of the microfluidic chip cocultures successfully recapitulated glial crosstalk, revealing unique responses. This crosstalk was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3 in the cocultures, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate molecular crosstalk between inflammatory microglia and astrocytes, providing evidence of how glial cells orchestrate responses during neuroinflammation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the microfluidic coculture platform developed in this study for microglia and astrocytes provides a more functional and enhanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.">

        <tr id="The long-term effects of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations on adaptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.">

        <tr id="The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection is reported to begin with the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human body through droplets, entering the lungs, and binding to the ACE-2 receptor. Meanwhile, activated macrophages stimulate an immune and inflammatory response, activating the coagulation cascade. This activation in COVID-19 patients can exacerbate the condition and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The coagulation cascade is influenced by the expression of related genes, including F3, F5, F8, F12, F13A1, VWF, THBD, PROC, PROCR, PROS1, SERPINE1, A2M, and PLAUR. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022, with 22 mild COVID-19 cases, 35 moderate-to-severe cases, and 20 healthy control individuals from Dr. M. Djamil Padang General Hospital in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Coagulation gene expression data using the RNA-Seq method with transcriptomic analysis were collected and recorded in transcript per-million (TPM) units. The results showed a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes in moderate-to-severe compared to mild COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The analysis of log2 folds change has a statistically significant increase observed in the expression of coagulation genes and a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes among moderate-to-severe and mild patients, as well as healthy controls. The results underscored the impact of COVID-19 infection on the activity of coagulation cascade genes, which could influence the condition of patients and serve as a reference for therapy.">

        <tr id="Chronic viral infections are ubiquitous in humans, with individuals harboring multiple latent viruses that can reactivate during acute illnesses. Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood. Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence (≥3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue. Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID- 19 and PASC.">

        <tr id="Microglia play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and display remarkable plasticity in their response to inflammatory stimuli. However, the specific signaling profiles that microglia adopt during such challenges remain incompletely understood. Traditional transcriptomic approaches provide valuable insights, but fail to capture dynamic post-translational changes. In this study, we utilized time-resolved single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to measure distinct signaling pathways activated in microglia upon exposure to bacterial and viral mimetics-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the immunomodulatory role of astrocytes on microglial signaling in mixed cultures. Microglia or mixed cultures derived from neonatal mice were treated with LPS or Poly(I:C) for 48 h. Cultures were stained with a panel of 33 metal-conjugated antibodies targeting signaling and identity markers. High-dimensional clustering analysis was used to identify emergent signaling modules. We found that LPS treatment led to more robust early activation of pp38, pERK, pRSK, and pCREB compared to Poly(I:C). Despite these differences, both LPS and Poly(I:C) upregulated the classical reactivity markers CD40 and CD86 at later time points. Strikingly, the presence of astrocytes significantly blunted microglial responses to both stimuli, particularly dampening CD40 upregulation. Our studies demonstrate that single-cell mass cytometry effectively captures the dynamic signaling landscape of microglia under pro-inflammatory conditions. This approach may pave the way for targeted therapeutic investigations of various neuroinflammatory disorders. Moreover, our findings underscore the necessity of considering cellular context, such as astrocyte presence, in interpreting microglial behavior during inflammation.">

        <tr id="Novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. COVID-19 is known to affect both the respiratory, digestive, excretory, and nervous systems. The incidence of chronic effects of the novel coronavirus infection is now on the rise. This paper is aimed to review the epidemiology, pathogenesis and components of post-COVID asthenia. Material and methods. Sixty-three references published between 2005 and 2023 and indexed in the PubMed, CyberLeninka, Russian Citation Index, Semantic Scholar, and Google Scholar databases were included in this review. Results. The study revealed the most common symptoms of post-COVID asthenia are fatigue, muscle weakness, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anxiety or depression, impaired memory and cognitive functions (“foggy brain”), hyposmia, and reduced work performance. One of the specific symptom complexes for post-COVID is asthenovegetative syndrome, the incidence of which according to the meta-analysis ranged from 13.1 to 72.8 %, with a cumulative percentage of 45 ± 0.05 % (95 % confidence interval 0.31–0.54). Conclusions. Nowadays, post-COVID asthenia is becoming extremely severe. It is necessary to review in detail the available data on the epidemiology and components of post-COVID asthenia in order to develop an adequate strategy for post-COVID management.">

        <tr id="Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a concern for world health since it may impact both the upper (nose, throat, sinuses) and lower (trachea, lungs) respiratory tracts. Death (at a rate of 10%), respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are among the problems that might arise. Recent years have seen a global spread of zoonotic coronaviruses, which have caused human epidemics such as MERS and SARS. Various clinical symptoms may be seen in this sickness because to the numerous changes in intestinal homeostasis caused by SARS-CoV-2. Because of the beneficial impact that probiotics have on the host immune system, gastrointestinal disorders may now be effectively treated. This article discusses the close relationship between what we eat, the bacteria in our gut, and the risk of contracting the COV-19 virus. 
Conclusion: The relationship between gut microbiota, dietary factors, and COVID-19 severity indicates that the microbiome may influence immune regulation. Imbalances in microbial communities and reduced diversity can intensify inflammation, potentially worsening COVID-19 outcomes. Strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary changes might provide therapeutic benefits by improving gut health and strengthening immune defenses. However, further research is required to clarify these mechanisms and establish effective interventions.">

        <tr id="During the COVID-19 pandemic, while most infected individuals experienced mild to moderate symptoms, a significant subset developed severe illness. A clinical test distinguishing between mild and severe cases could inform effective treatment strategies. Toward the latter stages of the pandemic, it became evident that vaccination or prior infection cannot entirely prevent reinfection. However, they are crucial in reducing the risk of severe disease by inducing T-cell memory. T cell receptors (TCRs), which can be obtained from human blood, serve as valuable biomarkers for monitoring T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we investigated the associations between TCR metrics and COVID-19 severity and found significant associations. Furthermore, such associations could depend on the subset of TCRs used (e.g., TCRs from CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells) and when the TCRs were collected.">

        <tr id="From December 2019 to March 2020, the human population faced a new coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, which led to global morbidity and high mortality worldwide. Typical features of coronavirus infection tended to resemble a seasonal infection over time. Despite this fact, it has been proven that, after acute disease, numerous disorders are detected in the patients, manifesting both with general health disturbances and as complications of pre-existing chronic diseases, including allergic syndrome. On the basis of these findings, the study of post-COVID syndrome became an important aspect of the ongoing COVID-19 research. It has been shown over recent decades that the number of people suffering from various types of allergic reactions is growing every year. Therefore, the studies in allergic pathology in the structure of post-COVID syndrome are among the most pressing issues. In addition to studying exacerbations of allergic reactions, a thorough analysis has shown that adverse reactions caused by coronavirus infection are viewed from new aspects, being characterized by functional disorders of acquired and innate immune response, causing increasingly severe consequences for the immune system and the whole body. Currently, the features of humoral immune response in post-COVID syndrome have not been sufficiently studied. In this respect, we have evaluated the features of humoral immunity in patients with post-COVID syndrome, with clinically confirmed allergic anamnesis. The study revealed changes in humoral immune system, indicating that the most significant changes are observed in post-COVID patients with a burdened history of allergies, thus requiring a more detailed study of immune status in order to develop an individualized approach to immunocorrection of these disorders in this group of patients.">

        <tr id="Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants raise concerns about decreased vaccine efficacy, vaccines continue to confer robust protection in humans, implying that immunity beyond neutralization contributes to vaccine efficacy. In addition to neutralization, antibodies can mediate various Fc-dependent effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, the specific role of each Fc-mediated effector function in contributing to COVID-19 disease attenuation in human remains unclear. To fully define the potential immune correlates of Fc-mediated effector functions, we comprehensively analyzed the above Fc-mediated effector functions in two study cohorts. In the CoronaVac vaccinee cohort, individuals without breakthrough infection exhibited higher levels of ADCP and ADNP activities with a greater degree of cross-reactivity compared to those who had breakthrough infection. A predictive model was established incorporating ADNP activity and IgG titer, achieving an area under the curve (AUC）of 0.837. In the COVID-19 patient cohort, BA.5-specific ADCP and ADNP responses were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients with fatal outcomes compared to milder outcomes. The prognostic model incorporating WT, BA.5, and XBB.1.5 spike-specific ADNP demonstrated effective predictive ability, achieving an AUC of 0.890. Meanwhile, transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients in the acute phases of infection highlighted remarkably upregulation of neutrophil activity and phagocytic function, further reinforcing the essential role of ADNP. Collectively, our findings underscored Fc-mediated effector activities, especially neutrophil phagocytosis, as significant antibody biomarkers for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection and COVID-19 prognosis.">

        <tr id="In clinical terms, chronic pain is the most prevalent sequela resulting from COVID-19, which is induced by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), while type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is the most common comorbidity. This triangular relationship can be attributed to the dysfunction of the insulin receptor signaling system (IRSS) in both central and peripheral systems. Patients with T2D are essentially more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the widespread expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in their pancreatic beta cells, which serves as the cellular port for the SARS-CoV-2 to infect and enter the cell. This infection can exacerbate chronic pain and insulin resistance for various reasons. Peripherally, once infected, the virus can cause damage to peripheral nerves and pancreatic β-cells, further exacerbating pain and glucose metabolism conditions. Additionally, in the central nervous system, dysfunctional IRSS is closely linked to chronic pain. Over the past few years of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing body of evidence suggests that insulin and other medications currently used in clinical practice for hyperglycemia control may not be safe for treating these patients. Therefore, we need a proper approach for the treatment of chronic pain in long COVID patients, especially patients with T2D. This review presents evidence that transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) may provide a viable treatment option for chronic pain and metabolic dysfunction by improving the function of IRSS in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues.">

These symptoms, which include chronic fatigue, respiratory distress, cognitive dysfunction, and other multisystem effects, significantly impact the quality of life of the affected individuals. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood, although studies have suggested a multifactorial origin. Proposed factors include viral persistence, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation disturbances, and gut dysbiosis. The identification of these mechanisms could facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, opening new perspectives for the effective management of persistent Covid. The diagnosis of PC is complex due to the diversity of symptoms and the lack of specific biomarkers. At present, therapeutic approaches focus primarily on symptomatic relief, but further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying PC and to develop targeted interventions.

 Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally. Most deaths from breast cancer are due to metastatic disease which often follows long periods of clinical dormancy. Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCC) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression. Infection with respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza or SARS-CoV-2) is common and triggers an inflammatory response locally and systemically. Here we show that influenza virus infection leads to loss of the pro-dormancy mesenchymal phenotype in breast DCC in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection, and a greater than 100-fold expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. Such DCC phenotypic change and expansion is interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependent. We further show that CD4 T cells are required for the maintenance of pulmonary metastatic burden post-influenza virus infection, in part through attenuation of CD8 cell responses in the lungs. Single-cell RNA-seq analyses reveal DCC-dependent impairment of T-cell activation in the lungs of infected mice. SARS-CoV-2 infected mice also showed increased breast DCC expansion in lungs post-infection. Expanding our findings to human observational data, we observed that cancer survivors contracting a SARS-CoV-2 infection have substantially increased risks of lung metastatic progression and cancer-related death compared to cancer survivors who did not. These discoveries underscore the significant impact of respiratory viral infections on the resurgence of metastatic cancer, offering novel insights into the interconnection between infectious diseases and cancer metastasis.

In addition to its high infectivity and pathogenicity and its rapid mutation rate, the unique capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to circumvent the immune system has also contributed to the widespread nature of this pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 elicits the onset of innate immune system activation and initiates antiviral responses once it has infected the host. While battling the host’s immune responses, SARS-CoV-2 has established many countermeasures to evade attack and clearance. As the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 continues, substantial evidence has revealed that the 29 proteins synthesized by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are integral to the viral infection process. They not only facilitate viral replication and transmission, but also assist SARS-CoV-2 in escaping the host’s immune defenses, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets that have attracted considerable attention in recent studies. This review summarizes the manner in which SARS-CoV-2 interfaces with the innate immune system, with a particular focus on the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications of mutations.">

        <tr id="Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making them a significant public health concern. During infection, respiratory viruses, including Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), trigger an antiviral immune response, specifically boosting the inflammatory response that plays a critical role in their pathogenesis. The inflammatory response induced by respiratory viruses can be a double-edged sword since it can be initially induced to be antiviral and protective/reparative from virus-induced injuries. Still, it can also be detrimental to host cells and tissues. However, the mechanisms that differentiate the complex crosstalk between favorable host inflammatory responses and harmful inflammatory responses are poorly understood. This review explores the complex interplay between viral pathogens and the host immune response, mainly focusing on the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of VRIs. We discuss how inflammation can both contain and exacerbate the progression of viral infections, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and emerging drugs for modulating the aberrant inflammatory responses during VRIs.">

Metabolic reprogramming, including increased glycolysis and altered mitochondrial function, promotes viral replication and stimulates inflammatory cytokine production, contributing to illness severity. Mitochondrial metabolism abnormalities, strongly linked to various systemic illnesses, worsen metabolic dysfunction during and after the pandemic, increasing cardiovascular consequences.

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Oligodendrocytes (OL) and their myelin-forming processes are targeted and lost during the disease course of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), targeted by infiltrating leukocytes and their effector cytokines. Myelin repair is considered to be dependent on recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The basis of failure of re-myelination during the disease course of MS remains to be defined. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of pro-inflammatory molecules tumor necrosis factor ⍰ (TNF⍰) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) on the differentiation of human OPCs. Methods We generated human OPCs from induced pluripotent stem cells with a reporter gene under the OL-specific transcription factor SOX10. We treated the cells in vitro with TNF⍰ or IFNγ and evaluated effects in terms of cell viability, expression of OL-lineage markers, and co- expression of astrocyte markers. To relate our findings to the molecular properties of OPCs as found in the MS brain we re-analyzed publicly available single nuclear RNAseq datasets. Results Our analysis indicated that both TNF⍰ and IFNγ decreased the proportion of cells differentiating into the OL-lineage; consistent with previous reports. We now observe the TNF⍰ effect is linked to aberrant OPC differentiation. A subset of O4+, reporter-positive cells co- expressed the astrocytic marker Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). On the transcriptomic level, the cells acquire an astrocyte-like signature alongside a conserved reactive phenotype. Analysis of single- nuclear RNAseq datasets from human MS brain revealed a subset of OPCs expressing an astrocytic signature. Discussion In the context of MS, these results imply that OPCs are present but inhibited from differentiating along the OL-lineage, with a subset acquiring a reactive and stem-cell like phenotype, reducing their capacity to contribute towards repair. These findings help define a potential basis for the impaired myelin repair in MS and provide a prospective route for regenerative treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Genetic studies indicate a causal role for microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the progress made in identifying genetic risk factors, such as CD33, and underlying molecular changes, there are currently limited treatment options for AD. Based on the immune‐inhibitory function of CD33, we hypothesize that inhibition of CD33 activation may reverse microglial suppression and restore their ability to resolve inflammatory processes and mitigate pathogenic amyloid plaques, which may be neuroprotective. Here, we investigate the effects of a competitive inhibitor peptide of CD33 binding, IMAD‐001, on downstream immune response in AD. Method Primary human monocyte‐derived microglia‐like cells (MDMi) and monocytes were treated with IMAD‐001 and we determined its effect on microglial function and immune signaling by measuring gene expression changes in markers of microglial activation by qPCR and amyloid beta (Aβ) uptake by flow cytometry. To measure the in vivo effects, we treated 12‐month‐old 5xFAD mice with weekly subcutaneous injections of 5mg/kg IMAD‐001 or vehicle control for 28 days and examined Aβ clearance by immunohistochemistry and CNS immune cell phenotypes by single‐cell (sc)RNA‐seq. Result IMAD‐001 treatment increased Aβ uptake in primary monocytes. In in vivo experiments, we see clearance of Aβ in the brains of the 5xFAD mice with weekly administration. Using scRNA‐seq of CD45+ cells, we identified the expected populations in the brains of the animals and found that peptide treated mice had an increase in classical dendritic cells and a slight decrease in disease‐associated microglia (DAM) and homeostatic microglia. Microglia cells regulated their phenotype in response to the peptide as well with notable downregulation of CD274/PD‐L1, an immunosuppressive molecule in which disruption of its interaction with PD‐1 was found to clear Aβ and improve cognitive performance. Interestingly, peptide treatment resulted in downregulation of IFITM3 and upregulation of CD74, suggesting CD33 inhibition influences microglia to inhibit Aβ production. Conclusion IMAD‐001 inhibition of CD33 resolved Aβ induced suppressed microglial immune signaling and increased microglial phagocytosis and response to their environment in vitro and in vivo, without inducing inappropriate activation, suggesting its potential for therapeutic use in AD.">

        <tr id="Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease, characterized by impaired wound repair, tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Immune system may participate in the development and progression of the disease as indicated by altered activity in IPF sufferers. This study investigates the immune response to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in patients with IPF compared to healthy controls, with a particular focus on evaluation of antibody responses, interferon-gamma release, cytokine profiling and a broad panel of immune cell subpopulations. IPF patients without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 had undetectable levels of anti-N IgG antibodies, highlighting their lack of previous infection. After vaccination, IPF patients showed a significant increase in anti-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies, though their levels were lower compared to healthy controls and convalescent IPF patients. Additionally, IPF patients exhibited altered proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T lymphocytes (Teffs) before and after vaccination. Specifically, IPF patients had higher percentages of Tregs with a Th2 phenotype and Th17 Tregs, along with reduced proportions of Th1/17 Tregs. Teffs in IPF patients showed a decrease in Th1-like and Th2-like populations after vaccination. Moreover, IPF patients demonstrated elevated populations of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc) before vaccination and increased levels of γδ Tc cells throughout the study. Alterations in cytokine profiles were also observed, IPF patients showed higher levels of IL-6 and IL-22 compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest a distinct immune response in IPF patients to the COVID-19 vaccine, characterized by differences in antibody production, T cell differentiation and cytokine secretion compared to healthy individuals.">

        <tr id="In multiple sclerosis (MS), microglia and macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in determining the balance among demyelination, neurodegeneration, and myelin repair. Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the lack of therapies aimed at promoting remyelination and slowing disease progression for individuals with MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, shifts the transcriptional programs of microglia and CNS-associated macrophages from a proinflammatory phenotype to a regenerative phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 stimulated scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that prevented the activation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes while also promoting neuroaxonal health and oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment of mice with bryo-1 augmented remyelination after a focal demyelinating injury. Our results demonstrate the potential of bryo-1 and possibly a wider class of PKC modulators as myelin-regenerative and supportive agents in MS and other neurologic diseases.">

 Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe psoriatic subtype characterized by epidermal neutrophil infiltration, often occurring in acute, potentially life-threatening episodes. However, the characterization of the immune microenvironment in GPP lesions compared with plaque psoriasis remains largely unknown. Here, we used single-cell RNA profiling to interrogate the transcriptomes of ∼60 000 single cells from GPP lesional skin (n = 13) and healthy adult skin (n = 4), combined with spatial RNA sequencing. GPP was associated with major shifts in multiple cell populations, including, in particular, increased frequency of myeloid immune cells and supraspinous keratinocytes. We identified a unique myeloid-derived neutrophil subset characterized by the absence of CASP8. CASP8− neutrophils were accompanied by high expression of inflammatory pathway genes, including RIPK1, NF-KB1, IL1B, CXCL1, and CXCL8 in a stable disease state and were found at low levels in an inactive state in healthy skin. Spatial mapping of these genes illustrated the neutrophil transition from pre-inflammation to a pro-inflammation state through casting off CASP8. In silico and in vitro co-culture studies demonstrated that the communication network between IL36G+ spinous KCs and neutrophils is enlarged in the GPP lesions, with TNFSF15 (TL1A) released from neutrophils exaggerating the inflammatory crosstalk. While there was a slight increase in Th17 cells, there was greater prominence of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells highlighted by upregulated GZMB, CCL5, NKG7, and PRF1 expression, hinting at a cytotoxicity tendency rather than inflammation response in GPP lesions. Notably, a subset of S100A9+ fibroblasts in GPP was observed to contribute to the amplification of the GPP immune network through the transition to a pro-inflammatory state, connected by ligand–receptor interactions with other spatially proximate immune cells, including Th17 cells, CD8+ Tc cells, neutrophils, and IL1B+ macrophages. In sum, these data provide an in-depth view of immune cell participation and highlight the role of neutrophil–KC–fibroblast crosstalk in GPP pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of long COVID (LC) still presents many areas of uncertainty. This leads to difficulties in finding an effective specific therapy. We hypothesize that the key to LC pathogenesis lies in the presence of chronic functional damage to the main anti-inflammatory mechanisms of our body: the three reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis, and the mitochondrial redox status. We will illustrate that this neuro-endocrine-metabolic axis is closely interconnected and how the SARS-CoV-2 can damage it at all stages through direct, immune-inflammatory, epigenetic damage mechanisms, as well as through the reactivation of neurotropic viruses. According to our theory, the direct mitochondrial damage carried out by the virus, which replicates within these organelles, and the cellular oxidative imbalance, cannot be countered in patients who develop LC. This is because their anti-inflammatory mechanisms are inconsistent due to reduced vagal tone and direct damage to the endocrine glands of the HPA axis. We will illustrate how acetylcholine (ACh) and cortisol, with its cytoplasmatic and cellular receptors respectively, are fundamental players in the LC process. Both Ach and cortisol play multifaceted and synergistic roles in reducing inflammation. They achieve this by modulating the activity of innate and cell-mediated immunity, attenuating endothelial and platelet activation, and modulating mitochondrial function, which is crucial for cellular energy production and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In our opinion, it is essential to study the sensitivity of the glucocorticoids receptor in people who develop LC and whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause long-term epigenetic variations in its expression and function.">

        <tr id="Interest to the topic of coronavirus infection remains unabated. At the same time, there is insufficient information in the literature on the clinical course of COVID-19 in systemic sclerosis (SSc), a systemic autoimmune disease associated with high mortality.Objective: to identify the characteristics of coronavirus disease in SSc and risk factors for severe COVID-19 and death.Material and methods. A retrospective analysis of data from patients with SSc was performed. The analyzed cohort included patients from the registry of the Systemic Sclerosis Laboratory of V.A. Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology. Information about the history of novel coronavirus infection was obtained by telephone interview 10 months after the outbreak of the pandemic. COVID-19 was diagnosed if there was a positive oral cavity/nasopharynx PCR swab, if antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were present and/or characteristic symptoms and computed tomography (CT) changes in the lungs were present.Results and discussion. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 57 (52%) patients with SSc. Their median age was 58 [31; 79] years. The majority were women (n=48, 84%) with a limited form of SSc (n=37, 65%). Fifteen (26%) patients had diffuse, 4 (7%) had overlapping (SSc-polymyositis and SSc-rheumatoid arthritis) and 1 (2%) had visceral SSc. Almost 2/3 (74%) of patients with COVID-19 had SSc associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD), with 40% of them having >20% lung parenchymal involvement.All patients received low-dose prednisone therapy, 95% received immunosuppressive therapy and in half of the cases mycophenolate mofetil; rituximab was used in 40% of patients.Chest CT scan was performed in 51 (89%) patients. Pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection was detected in 46 (90%) of them: CT1 (up to 25% lung involvement) – in 10 (20%), CT2 (25–50% involvement) – in 21 (41%) and CT3 (50–75% involvement) – in 15 (29%); in 5 (10%) cases no changes were detected on CT.Mild and moderate course of the viral infection was observed in 19 (33%) and 18 (32%) patients respectively, severe infection – in 20 (35%), including fatal cases in 12 (21%).Conclusion. Patients with SSc infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of severe coronavirus infection, often due to the association of the underlying disease with ILD and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, including biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. In case of COVID-19 development the high incidence of cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities that characterize SSc may contribute to a decrease in the efficacy of therapy for both the underlying disease and coronavirus infection, generally worsening the prognosis in these patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous, ranging from cases with mild disease with an almost asymptomatic carrier to severe cases, in which the disease evolves rapidly. A better understanding of monocyte response during SARS-CoV-2 infection would highlight potential biomarkers and establish other possible approaches for severe cases. Methods The study group consisted of 32 COVID-19 patients and 18 health controls from June 2023 to March 2024. The COVID-19 patients were further classified as mild and severe illnesses based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. For flow cytometric analysis, 50 µL of peripheral blood and 1 µL of specific monoclonal antibodies were added to each cytometric tube for surface marker detection. Results Here, the promising finding was that the blood non-classical/classical monocyte (NC/CL) subset was skewed toward NChighCLlow and NClowCLhigh clusters among the severe COVID-19 patients. The NChighCLlow cluster in severe COVID-19 displayed a distinct clinical phenotype, implying a higher 7-day disease progression rate (p = 0.019) and a worse 28-day survival (p = 0.026). Moreover, the secretion of IL-1β and IFN-γ was primarily attributed to CL subset in monocytes, while IL-6 was secreted mainly by NC subset. Conclusion As supported, regarding cytokine profile in context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it was identified that circulating NC cells are proinflammatory cells most related to regulatory cells, while CL subset displayed an effective capacity to virus. These findings have implications toward optimizing evaluation in severe COVID-19, and developing strategies that target altered balance of NC/CL cell subsets.">

        <tr id="The Flaviviridae are a family of viruses that include the important arthropod-borne human pathogens dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus. Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is essential for virus replication but is also secreted from virus-infected cells. Extracellular NS1 acts as a virulence factor during flavivirus infection in multiple ways, including triggering endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak via interaction with endothelial cells. While the role of NS1 in inducing vascular leak and exacerbating pathogenesis is well appreciated, if and how NS1-triggered endothelial dysfunction promotes virus infection remains obscure. Flaviviruses have a common need to disseminate from circulation into specific tissues where virus-permissive cells reside. Tissue-specific dissemination is associated with disease manifestations of a given flavivirus, but mechanisms dictating virus dissemination are unclear. Here we show that NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction promotes virus dissemination in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models of DENV infection, we show that anti-NS1 antibodies decrease virus dissemination, while the addition of exogenous NS1 promotes virus dissemination. Using an in vitro system, we show that NS1 promotes virus dissemination in two distinct ways: (1) promoting crossing of barriers and (2) increasing infectivity of target cells in a tissue- and virus-specific manner. The capacity of NS1 to modulate infectivity correlates with a physical association between virions and NS1, suggesting a potential NS1-virion interaction. Taken together, our study indicates that flavivirus NS1 promotes virus dissemination across endothelial barriers, providing an evolutionary basis for virus-triggered vascular leak. Author Summary The Flaviviridae contain numerous medically important human pathogens that cause potentially life-threatening infections. Over half of the world’s population is at risk of flavivirus infection, and this number is expected to increase as climate change expands the habitats of the arthropod vectors that transmit these flaviviruses. There are few effective vaccines and no therapeutics approved for prevention or treatment of flavivirus infection, respectively. Given these challenges, understanding how and why flaviviruses cause pathogenesis is critical for identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. The secreted nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of flaviviruses is a conserved virulence factor that triggers endothelial dysfunction in a tissue-specific manner. It is unknown if this endothelial dysfunction provides any benefit for virus infection. Here we provide evidence that NS1-triggered endothelial dysfunction facilitates virus crossing of endothelial barriers and augments infection of target cells in vitro and promotes virus dissemination in vivo. This study provides an evolutionary explanation for flaviviruses evolving the capacity to trigger barrier dysfunction and highlights NS1 and the pathways governing endothelial dysfunction, as therapeutic targets to prevent flavivirus dissemination.">

Although SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been responsible for pneumonia,
recent studies indicate that it also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain, among other vital organs.
Evidence suggests that this virus may travel retrogradely from the olfactory epithelium to brain
stem sections, causing neurological impairments in a significant number of individuals. Individuals
with severe COVID-19 frequently have elevated cytokines that promote inflammation and acute
respiratory failure and require frequent supportive ventilation. These factors are believed to contribute
to cognitive deterioration. Severe neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients include- paralysis,
stroke, cranial nerve deficits, delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, and meningitis. The virus, with
its unique structure, and a high binding affinity for the human enzyme ACE2 (used as an entry point
by the virus), contributes significantly to its deadly nature. Furthermore, to address the outbreak effectively,
researchers worldwide must develop precise treatment strategies. Advancing new diagnostic
and treatment methods to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on cognition requires further
epidemiological research and clinical experience. Additionally, by understanding the virus's
impact on cognitive functions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted treatments to alleviate
these severe neurological consequences.

        <tr id="A positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that devastated the world. While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID- 19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.">

        <tr id="The development of new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic potential of microvascular endothelium. A specific feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the post-COVID syndrome that is characterised by long-term impairment of various organs and systems. The immune pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis requires special attention due to their baseline pro-inflammatory status. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of novel coronavirus infection on the risk of chronic systemic hyper-inflammation and low-grade systemic inflammation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Two main groups consisted of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had survived COVID-19 (mild form) 3 months ago, or at earlier terms, including the subjects with post-COVID symptoms and those free of these symptoms. The comparison group included patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without a history of COVID-19. The control group was presented by healthy blood donors. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFá), D-dimers, troponin I, cortisol, and endothelin I (ET-I) were measured in patients’ plasma by immunoassay technique. On the basis of these markers, we calculated integral indices of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) – the levels of reactivity (RL), and chronic systemic hyper-inflammation (ChSI). Low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) was diagnosed in absence of ChSI, but in cases of simultaneous increase of D-dimer levels 250 ng/ml and ET-I levels 90 pg/ml in the patient. 
The most prevalent symptoms of post-COVID in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were tachycardia, arthralgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, which correspond to the population-wide data. By all empirical parameters, the groups of tuberculosis patients were comparable to each other (p 0.05) and significantly differed from control group. However, evaluation of integral indexes is more crucial for assessing the ‘systemic’ origin of the process. Thus, 23-50% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed subcritical SIR (RL = 1-2), being a feature of ChSI in 7.1-13.6% of cases (both in COVID-19 reconvalescents and non-COVID-19 patients). Meanwhile, all patient groups did not show significant difference in the frequency of LGSI and endothelial dysfunction (p 0.05). However, there was a trend towards an increase of these scores in the following sequence: tuberculosis without COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 + post-COVID syndrome. 
Most patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are not characterized by the development of chronic systemic hyperinflammation. LGSI is the most probable feature of general pathology in tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis infection sufficiently contributes to the development of LGSI, since the frequency and severity of LGSI and its individual manifestations are independent on the new coronavirus infection and signs of post-COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="Controlled activation of macrophages to achieve desired phenotypes in vivo and in vitro could lead to possible treatments for several inflammatory and proliferative diseases. This investigation uniquely established that dengue protease enhances the polarization and activation of human and murine macrophages following extracellular exposure. It was observed that macrophages have a robust response to extracellularly administered purified dengue NS2B/NS3 protease; it stimulated the macrophages in classical M1 directions and enhanced both the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). The cells exhibited an increase in the intracellular levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ and an elevation of phosphorylated versions of Akt, P38 MARK, SAPK, and ERK. In tandem, this investigation also established that the heightened responses of stimulated cells were associated with an increase in the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB (P65) protein. The cell viability assay showed that NS2B/NS3 protease exerts no major toxic effect on macrophages after 24 hours of treatment, even at a dosage (20 μg/ml) which was four times higher than the effective dose (5 μg/ml). Remarkably, we also observed that the native form of the viral protease, which drives its enzyme activities, had no bearing on the antigenic qualities of the enzyme. Thus, our study highlighted the efficacy of dengue viral NS2B/NS3 protease as a non-toxic ex vivo macrophage activating/polarizing agent and may serve a vital role in macrophage-based cell therapy in the near future.">

        <tr id="Severe asthma in children is notoriously difficult to treat, and its immunopathogenesis is complex. In particular, the contribution of T cells and relationships to anti-viral immunity, remain enigmatic. Here, we coupled deep phenotyping with machine learning methods to resolve the dynamics of T cells in the diseased lower airways, and examined rhinovirus (RV) as a driver. Our strategy revealed a T-cell landscape dominated by type 1 and type 17 CD8+ signatures. Interrogation of phenotypic relationships coupled with trajectory mapping identified T-cell migratory and differentiation pathways spanning the blood and airways that culminated in tissue residency, and included transitions between type 1 and type 17 tissue-resident types. These T-cell dynamics were reflected in cytokine polyfunctionality in situ. Use of machine learning to cross-compare T-cell populations that were enriched in the airways of RV-positive children with those induced in the blood after RV challenge in an experimental infection model, precisely pinpointed RV-responsive signatures that mapped to T-cell differentiation pathways. Despite their rarity, these signatures were detected in the airways of uninfected children. Together, our results underscore the aberrant nature of type 1 immunity in the airways of children with severe asthma, and implicate an important viral trigger as a driver.">

Using PBMC-derived induced microglia-like cells (piMGLCs) in a scalable assay, we screened 489 CNS-penetrant compounds for modulation of microglial phagocytosis of human synaptosomes in a validated assay for microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. Compounds from the library that reduced phagocytosis by ≥2 standard deviations across the library without cytotoxicity were validated in secondary screens, with 28 of them further confirmed to reduce phagocytosis by 50% or more. Image-based morphological measurements were calculated to measure the degree of ramified vs. amoeboid morphotype as an indicator of activation state. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling indicated divergent effects on cell signaling, metabolism, activation, and actin dynamics across confirmed compounds. In particular, multiple CNS-penetrant small molecules with prior FDA approval or demonstration of safety in vivo demonstrated modulatory effects on microglia. These potential disease-modifying agents represent high-priority candidates for repositioning studies in neurodevelopmental, neuroinflammatory, or neurodegenerative disorders.">

Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus (LASV) infection reproducing the different outcomes of the disease, we performed histological and transcriptomic studies to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity, with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever. By contrast, the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response, is associated with a fatal outcome. These results provide new insight into early viral dynamics and the host response to LASV infection according to disease outcome.">

        <tr id="Rabies virus (RABV) proteins play dual roles during the infection of complex neural tissue, the generation and spread of new virions and the active inhibition of cellular innate immune pathways, both contributing to rabies’ lethality. While spatially-distinct RABV protein residues specializing in virus-centric and immune-inhibitory functions have been identified, how these dual functions interact to shape infection outcomes across diverse types of host brain cells is unknown. To “unmask” and study how innate immune inhibition affects the transcriptional regulation of the human and viral genome with cellular resolution, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of co-cultured human brain cell types, comparing infection dynamics of a wild-type RABV isolate virus to a mutant virus in which six critical point mutations in the phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M) RABV proteins selectively neuter antagonism of interferon- and NF-κB- dependent cellular responses. Our analysis reveals that RABV gene expression is shaped by host cell type and that wild-type RABV infection induces small-scale, cell-type conserved transcriptional programs that may support infection by hijacking transcriptional feedback systems that control pro-viral host cell factors while minimizing anti-viral responses. In contrast to accepted models, disinhibited innate immune signaling increases RABV transcriptional output across infected cell types. Most strikingly, we discovered a subpopulation of astrocytes that supports an average of 6-fold higher viral mRNA expression through a massive host cell transcriptional change involving ∼38% of astrocyte expressed genes. Our analysis suggests that these astrocytes we term “pro-viral” are a rare subtype present in the human brain and are primed to play a protective role during viral infection in concert with interferon-sensitive microglia recalcitrant to infection.">

So far, HERVs have been studied in the context of extensive immunopathogenic, neuropathogenic and even oncogenic effects within their host. In particular, in our paper, we elaborate on the aspects related to the possible correlation of transposable HERV elements’ activation and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s presence in cells of COVID-19 patients or upon COVID-19 vaccination with implications for natural and adaptive immunity. In particular, the release of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 occurs in such cases and plays a notable role in sustaining chronic inflammation. Moreover, well-known interindividual variations of HERVs might partially account for the interpersonal variability of COVID-19 symptoms or unwanted events post-vaccination. Accordingly, further studies are required to clarify the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s role in triggering HERVs.">

        <tr id="Introduction Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a predominant subset of innate-like T cells in humans, characterized by diverse gene expression profiles and functional capabilities. However, the factors influencing the transcriptomes and effector functions of MAIT cells, particularly at mucosal barriers, remain largely unclear. Methods In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and functional assays to investigate the transcriptomic and functional characteristics of intestinal MAIT cells in mouse models during aging. We also extended scRNA-seq analysis to human intestinal MAIT cells to compare their gene expression patterns with those observed in aged mice. Results Our findings demonstrated that the transcriptomes and functional capabilities of intestinal MAIT cells shifted from MAIT17 to MAIT1 profiles with aging in mouse models, with notable changes in the production of cytotoxic molecules. Further scRNA-seq analysis of human intestinal MAIT cells revealed a segregation into MAIT1 and MAIT17 subsets, displaying gene expression patterns that mirrored those seen in aged mouse models. The transcription factor RORγt was expressed in both MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, acting to repress IFNγ production while promoting IL17 expression. Moreover, reduced expression of RORC and Il17A was correlated with poorer survival outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. Discussion These results suggest that aging induces a functional shift between MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, which may be influenced by transcriptional regulators like RORγt. The observed alterations in MAIT cell activity could potentially impact disease prognosis, particularly in colorectal cancer.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex and multifaceted process that involves dynamic interactions among various cellular and molecular components. This sophisticated interplay supports both environmental adaptability and system resilience in the central nervous system (CNS) but may be disrupted during neuroinflammation. In this article, we first characterize the key players in neuroimmune interactions, including microglia, astrocytes, neurons, immune cells, and essential signaling molecules such as cytokines, neurotransmitters, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and neurotrophic factors. Under homeostatic conditions, these elements promote cellular cooperation and stability, whereas in neuroinflammatory states, they drive adaptive responses that may become pathological if dysregulated. We examine how neuroimmune interactions, mediated through these cellular actors and signaling pathways, create complex networks that regulate CNS functionality and respond to injury or inflammation. To further elucidate these dynamics, we provide insights using a multilayer network (MLN) approach, highlighting the interconnected nature of neuroimmune interactions under both inflammatory and homeostatic conditions. This perspective aims to enhance our understanding of neuroimmune communication and the mechanisms underlying shifts from homeostasis to neuroinflammation. Applying an MLN approach offers a more integrative view of CNS resilience and adaptability, helping to clarify inflammatory processes and identify novel intervention points within the layered landscape of neuroinflammatory responses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Macrophages and microglia are myeloid cells that play critical roles in the surveillance of the local environment of the tissues in which they reside. The ability of these phagocytes to perform key functions is contingent on their capacity to sense extracellular cues and mount responses that involve chemotaxis, proliferation, cytokine secretion, and phagocytosis of various cargos for lysosomal clearance. Our overarching hypothesis is that lysosomal degradation of phagocytic cargoes is critical for the resolution of cellular/tissue damage, as well as of inflammation, and that failure to accomplish this step affects myeloid cell states and immune responses. Method To test this hypothesis, we examined the consequences of disrupting lysosomal function on myeloid cell state, using GRN deficiency as a model of primary lysosomal dysfunction. Result GRN is highly expressed in these cells and encodes progranulin, a frontotemporal dementia‐linked protein critical for the regulation of lysosomal degradative processes. We first performed single‐nucleus RNA‐sequencing of purified microglia from aged wild‐type and Grn knockout (KO) mice, defining the diverse subpopulations that emerge with disease in this context. Next, we characterized primary microglia and macrophages from Grn KO mice cultured in the absence of other cell types, which revealed robust cell autonomous transcriptional and functional alterations resulting from Grn deficiency. To further examine how specific forms of lysosomal dysfunction impact myeloid cell state, we induced pharmacological and genetic perturbations of various lysosomal properties, which uncovered a robust response of myeloid cells to lysosomal deacidification that largely overlaps with that observed in Grn KO myeloid cells. Finally, we identified putative transcription factors that mediate the transcriptional remodeling of myeloid cells in response to lysosomal stress. Conclusion Overall, these data reveal a novel link between lysosomal health and myeloid cell transcriptional and functional states.">

        <tr id="Introduction Chronic immune activation is a hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that significantly impacts disease pathogenesis. However, in-depth studies characterizing the immunological landscape of the ectocervix during chronic HIV infection remain scarce despite the importance of this tissue site for HIV transmission. Methods Ectocervical tissue samples were obtained from antiretroviral-naïve HIV-seropositive and -seronegative Kenyan female sex workers. These samples were assessed by spatial transcriptomics and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. We further performed multi-epitope ligand cartography (MELC) using an in situ staining panel that included 17 markers of primarily T cell–mediated immune responses. Results Spatial transcriptomics revealed tissue-wide immune activation encompassing immune responses associated with chronic HIV infection. First, both the epithelial and submucosal compartments showed diverse but significant upregulation of humoral immune responses, as indicated by the expression of several antibody-related genes. Second, an antiviral state–associated cellular immunity was also observed in the HIV-seropositive group, characterized by upregulation of genes involved in interferon signaling across the mucosal tissue and a more spatially restricted mucosal expression of genes related to T cell activity and effector functions relative to the HIV-seronegative group. Additionally, HIV associated structural alterations were evident within both compartments. Downregulated genes across the epithelium were mainly linked to epithelial integrity, with the outer layer involved in terminal differentiation and the inner layer associated with epithelial structure. MELC analysis further revealed a significantly increased ectocervical leukocyte population in HIV-seropositive participants, primarily driven by an increase in CD8+ T cells while the CD4+ T cell population remained stable. Consistent with our spatial transcriptomics data, T cells from HIV-seropositive participants showed an increased effector phenotype, defined by elevated expression of various granzymes. Conclusion By combining spatial transcriptomics and MELC, we identified significant HIV-associated cervical immune activity driven by induction of both T and B cell activity, together with a general antiviral state characterized by sustained interferon induction. These findings underscore that chronic HIV infection is associated with an altered ectocervical mucosal immune landscape years after primary infection. This sheds light on HIV pathogenesis at distant local sites and complements current knowledge on HIV-associated systemic immune activation.">

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) is an important component of lung extracellular matrix that increases following infection with influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Hellman et al. (U. Hellman, E. Rosendal, J. Lehrstrand, J. Henriksson, et al., mBio 15:e01303-24, https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01303-24) show that fragmented HA accumulates in the lungs of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, with systemic levels of HA being associated with reduced lung function 3–6 months after infection. This study provides novel insights into HA’s role in COVID-19 pathology and its potential utility as a biomarker for disease severity. However, much remains to be understood about the lung HA matrix in COVID-19 and how it compares to other lung conditions. In particular, the role of HA-binding proteins in organizing HA into a crosslinked network is yet to be fully determined at a molecular level. This knowledge is crucial in understanding the inter-relationships between the structure of the HA matrix and the regulation of the immune response, and thus our ability to target HA therapeutically for improved outcomes in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Chronic HIV infection drives B-cell dysfunction associated with the accumulation of tissue-like memory (TLMs) and activated memory B cells (MBCs) but decline in resting memory B cells. TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21- CD27- B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-betlow) and TLM2 (T-bethi) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global pandemic affecting millions of people's lives, which has led to 'post-COVID-19 fatigue'. Alarmingly, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only infects the lungs but also influences the heart and brain. Endothelial cell dysfunction and hypercoagulation, which we know occur with this infection, lead to thrombo-inflammation that can manifest as many myriad cardio-cerebrovascular disorders, such as brain fog, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, etc. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with oxidative stress, protein aggregation, cytokine storm, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, the identification of molecular targets involved in these actions could provide strategies for preventing and treating this disease. In particular, the very common enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) has recently been identified as a candidate co-receptor for the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with its involvement in infection. In addition, DPPIV has been reported as a co-receptor for some viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It mediates immunologic reactions and diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension, which have been considered the prime risk factors for stroke among other types of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), DPPIV has been implicated in aggravating the course of infection due to its disruptive effect on inflammatory signaling networks and the neuro-glia-vascular unit. Regarding the neurological, physiological, and molecular grounds governing post-COVID-19 fatigue, this review focuses on DPPIV as one of such reasons that progressively establishes cerebrovascular grievances following SARS-CoV infection.">

        <tr id="Hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibit diverse immune responses during acute infection, which are associated with a wide range of clinical outcomes. However, understanding these immune heterogeneities and their links to various clinical complications, especially long COVID, remains a challenge. In this study, we performed unsupervised subtyping of longitudinal multi-omics immunophenotyping in over 1,000 hospitalized patients, identifying two critical subtypes linked to mortality or mechanical ventilation with prolonged hospital stay and three severe subtypes associated with timely acute recovery. We confirmed that unresolved systemic inflammation and T-cell dysfunctions were hallmarks of increased severity and further distinguished patients with similar acute respiratory severity by their distinct immune profiles, which correlated with differences in demographic and clinical complications. Notably, one critical subtype (SubF) was uniquely characterized by early excessive inflammation, insufficient anticoagulation, and fatty acid dysregulation, alongside higher incidences of hematologic, cardiac, and renal complications, and an elevated risk of long COVID. Among the severe subtypes, significant differences in viral clearance and early antiviral responses were observed, with one subtype (SubC) showing strong early T-cell cytotoxicity but a poor humoral response, slower viral clearance, and greater risks of chronic organ dysfunction and long COVID. These findings provide crucial insights into the complex and context-dependent nature of COVID-19 immune responses, highlighting the importance of personalized therapeutic strategies to improve both acute and long-term outcomes.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), the pathophysiology of which remains unclear and for which there is no definitive cure. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are immunomodulatory molecules expressed in various tissues, including the CNS. Here, we investigated whether the cathelicidin-related AMP (CRAMP) modulated the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. We showed that, at early stage, CNS-recruited neutrophils produced neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) rich in CRAMP that was required for EAE initiation. NET-associated CRAMP stimulated IL-6 production by dendritic cells via the cGAS/STING pathway, thereby promoting encephalitogenic Th17 response. However, at a later disease stage, neurons also expressed CRAMP that reduced EAE severity. Camp knockdown in neurons led to disease exacerbation, while local injection of CRAMP1-39 at the peak of EAE promoted disease remission. In vitro, CRAMP1-39 regulated the activation of microglia and astrocytes through the formyl peptide receptor (FPR)2. Finally, administration of butyrate, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, stimulated the expression of neural CRAMP via the free fatty acids receptors (FFAR)2/3, and prevented EAE. This study shows that CRAMP produced by different cell types have opposing effects on neuroinflammation, offering therapeutic opportunities for MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Signal transduction downstream of activating stimuli controls CD8+ T cell biology, however these external inputs can become uncoupled from transcriptional regulation in Primary Immune Regulatory Disorders (PIRD). Gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT3 amplify cytokine signaling and cause a severe PIRD characterized by early onset autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, recurrent infections, and immune dysregulation. In both primary human and mouse models of STAT3 GOF, CD8+ T cells have been implicated as pathogenic drivers of autoimmunity. The molecular mechanisms by which STAT3 GOF variants drive this pathology remain unclear. We found that naïve CD8+ T cells have an increased capacity for IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion. Given this dysregulation of CD8+ T cell function, we evaluated changes in immunoregulatory pathways and found evidence of dysregulated purinergic signaling via high dimensional immune profiling, single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional assessment. Specifically, while expression of CD39, which transforms ATP to AMP, was increased on CD8+ T cells from patients with STAT3 GOF, downstream purinergic family members, CD73 and the adenosine receptor, A2AR, were downregulated, impairing the potential to produce or sense inhibitory adenosine. Patients with STAT3 GOF can be clinically treated with JAK inhibitors and this partially normalized naïve CD8+ T cell dysregulation, including aberrant cytokine production. The extent of normalization of cytokine secretion scaled with normalization of CD73 and A2AR. This suggests that a dysregulated purinergic signaling axis plays an important role in CD8+ T cell dysregulation in STAT3 GOF, which may have implications for other inflammatory disorders with amplified STAT signaling. One Sentence Summary Amplified STAT3 signaling in CD8+ T cells from STAT3 GOF patients alters purinergic signaling and dysregulates CD8+ T cell function.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to major global health concern. However, the focus on immediate effects was assumed as the tip of iceberg due to the symptoms following acute infection, which was defined as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). Gut microbiota alterations even after disease resolution and the gastrointestinal symptoms are the key features of PACS. Gut microbiota and derived metabolites disorders may play a crucial role in inflammatory and immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection through the gut-lung axis. Diet is one of the modifiable factors closely related to gut microbiota and COVID-19. In this review, we described the reciprocal crosstalk between gut and lung, highlighting the participation of diet and gut microbiota in and after COVID-19 by destroying the gut barrier, perturbing the metabolism and regulating the immune system. Therefore, bolstering beneficial species by dietary supplements, probiotics or prebiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be a novel avenue for COVID-19 and PACS prevention. This review provides a better understanding of the association between gut microbiota and the long-term consequences of COVID-19, which indicates modulating gut dysbiosis may be a potentiality for addressing this multifaceted condition.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito‐borne alphavirus that is primarily known for causing severe joint and muscle symptoms, but its pathological effects have extended beyond these tissues. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive proteomic analysis across various organs in rodent and nonhuman primate models to investigate CHIKV's impact on organs beyond joints and muscles and to identify key host factors involved in its pathogenesis. Our findings reveal significant species‐specific similarities and differences in immune responses and metabolic regulation, with proteins like Interferon‐Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) and Retinoic Acid‐Inducible Gene I (RIG‐I) playing crucial roles in the anti‐CHIKV defense. We observed upregulated and downregulated metabolic status in CHIKV‐infected rhesus monkeys and mice, respectively. Additionally, we identified host factors such as S100 Calcium‐Binding Protein A8/A9 (S100A8/A9), Voltage‐Dependent Anion Channel 1/2 (VDAC1/2), Complement Component 3 (C3), Apoptosis‐Inducing Factor Mitochondria‐Associated 1 (AIFM1), Endothelial Cell‐Specific Chemotaxis Regulator (ECSCR), and Kininogen 1 (KNG1) that may contribute to CHIKV‐induced inflammation and hemorrhage. These insights put emphases on the importance of understanding CHIKV's impact on organs beyond joints and muscles, providing potential therapeutic targets and enhancing our understanding of CHIKV pathogenesis. This research underscores the need for appropriate animal models in CHIKV studies and informs the development of targeted therapies to address its systemic effects.">

        <tr id="Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular opportunistic parasite that exists in a latent form within the human central nervous system (CNS), even in immune-competent hosts. During acute infection, T. gondii traverses the blood–brain barrier (BBB). In the subsequent chronic infection phase, the infiltration of immune cells into the brain, driven by T. gondii infection and the formation of parasitic cysts, leads to persistent activation and proliferation of astrocytes and microglia. This process results in neuronal damages that are fatal in some cases. Through inducing systemic immune responses, T. gondii infection can dramatically alter the behavior of rodents and increase the risk of various neuropsychiatric disorders in humans. In this review, we explore some recent research progress on the major events involved in BBB disruption, glial cell activation and neuronal damage following T. gondii infection in hosts. It further discusses potential pathological mechanisms and the feasible treatment approaches for the neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders caused by T. gondii infection to extend our understanding for pathogenesis and preventive control of toxoplasmosis in humans.">

        <tr id="Dysregulation of intracellular signaling networks underpins cancer. However, a systems-level elucidation of how signaling networks within distinct cell subpopulations drive cancer progression in vivo has been unattainable due to technical limitations. We developed INSIGHT (INvestigating SIGnaling network of specific cell subpopulation in Heterogeneous Tissue), a new platform technology combining fluorescence-activated cell sorting with ultra-sensitive mass spectrometry to enable phosphoproteomic characterization of rare and discrete cell subpopulations from fixed tissues. We demonstrated the broad utility of INSIGHT by analyzing the oligodendroglial cell-specific signaling network in the mouse brain. We then applied INSIGHT to investigate the rare, disseminated tumor cell subpopulation in glioblastoma patient-derived xenograft models. INSIGHT uncovered a global rewiring of signaling networks with tumor cell dissemination, marked by a transition from proliferation-associated signaling in the primary tumor cells to signaling associated with postsynapse, neuronal migration, and ion homeostasis in disseminated tumor cells. We reveal interconnections between signaling circuitries within the networks, with numerous proteins, including GluA2, exhibiting altered phosphorylation without protein expression changes, emphasizing the role of post-translational modifications in glioblastoma dissemination. We validated key phosphorylation changes and inferred differentially active kinases with tumor spread to offer new systems-level insights into glioblastoma dissemination mechanisms in vivo. INSIGHT is generally applicable to a wide range of biological systems without genetic engineering and provides quantitative phosphorylation and protein expression data for selected cell subpopulations from heterogeneous tissues.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction This review delves into the intricate relationship between NLR inflammasomes, particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the immune‐mediated neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). While the precise etiology of MS remains elusive, compelling research underscores the pivotal role of the immune response in disease progression. Notably, recent investigations highlight the significant involvement of NLRP3 inflammasomes in various autoimmune diseases, prompting an in‐depth exploration of their impact on MS. Method The review focuses on elucidating the activation mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasomes within microglia/macrophages (MG/MФ), examining how this activation promotes an inflammatory response that exacerbates neuronal damage in MS. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature and research findings forms the basis for understanding the intricate interplay between NLRP3 inflammasomes and MS pathogenesis. Results Synthesizing current research, the review provides insight into the pivotal role played by NLR inflammasomes, specifically NLRP3, in MS. Emphasis is placed on the inflammatory response orchestrated by activated MG/MФ, elucidating the cascade that perpetuates neuronal damage in the disease. Conclusions This review concludes by consolidating key findings and offering a nuanced perspective on the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in MS pathogenesis. The detailed exploration of the activation process within MG/MФ provides a foundation for understanding the disease's underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the review sets the stage for potential therapeutic strategies targeting NLRP3 inflammasomes in the pursuit of MS treatment.">

        <tr id="Viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in children worldwide. Despite this, no studies have employed proteomics to characterize host immune responses to severe pediatric vLRTI in both the lower airway and systemic circulation. To address this gap, gain insights into vLRTI pathophysiology, and test a novel diagnostic approach, we assayed 1,305 proteins in tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma from 62 critically ill children using SomaScan. We performed differential expression (DE) and pathway analyses comparing vLRTI (n = 40) to controls with non-infectious acute respiratory failure (n = 22), developed a diagnostic classifier using LASSO regression, and analyzed matched TA and plasma samples. We further investigated the impact of viral load and bacterial coinfection on the proteome. The TA signature of vLRTI was characterized by 200 DE proteins (Padj <0.05) with upregulation of interferons and T cell responses and downregulation of inflammation-modulating proteins including FABP and MIP-5. A nine-protein TA classifier achieved an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-1.00) for identifying vLRTI. In plasma, the host response to vLRTI was more muted with 56 DE proteins. Correlation between TA and plasma was limited, although ISG15 was elevated in both compartments. In bacterial coinfection, we observed increases in the TNF-stimulated protein TSG-6, as well as CRP, and interferon-related proteins. Viral load correlated positively with interferon signaling and negatively with neutrophil-activation pathways. Taken together, our study provides fresh insights into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI and identifies novel protein biomarkers with diagnostic potential.IMPORTANCEWe describe the first proteomic profiling of the lower airway and blood in critically ill children with severe viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI). From tracheal aspirate (TA), we defined a proteomic signature of vLRTI characterized by increased expression of interferon signaling proteins and decreased expression of proteins involved in immune modulation including FABP and MIP-5. Using machine learning, we developed a parsimonious diagnostic classifier that distinguished vLRTI from non-infectious respiratory failure with high accuracy. Comparative analysis of paired TA and plasma specimens demonstrated limited concordance, although the interferon-stimulated protein ISG15 was significantly upregulated with vLRTI in both compartments. We further identified TSG-6 and CRP as airway biomarkers of bacterial-viral coinfection, and viral load analyses demonstrated a positive correlation with interferon-related protein expression and a negative correlation with the expression of neutrophil activation proteins. Taken together, our study provides new insights into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Monocyte‐derived macrophages and microglia initially adopt an anti‐inflammatory phenotype following stroke but later transition to a pro‐inflammatory state. The mechanisms underlying this phenotypic shift remain unclear. This study investigates the activation dynamics of molecular signaling pathways in macrophages and microglia after stroke. Methods We utilized publicly available single‐cell RNA sequencing datasets to examine the activation dynamics of molecular signaling pathways alongside the pro‐inflammatory phenotype of macrophages and microglia. Male C57BL/6 mice underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), with the STING inhibitor H151 administered to tMCAO mice. Neurobehavioral performance was assessed using rotarod, foot fault, novel object recognition, and water maze tests at 5‐, 7‐, 10‐, and 14‐days post‐stroke. Primary microglia and bone marrow‐derived macrophages were cultured for in vitro experiments. Results Single‐cell sequencing data indicated that the activation of STING and subsequent type I interferon signaling drove the phenotypic shift of microglia and macrophages toward a pro‐inflammatory state in the stroke lesion. Immunostaining demonstrated that the emergence of pro‐inflammatory microglia and macrophages aligned with the activation time course of STING and type I interferon signaling. Continuous phagocytosis by macrophages and microglia led to STING activation, which triggered type I interferon signaling and promoted the phenotypic shift. Inhibition of STING signaling prevented this transition, reduced neuroinflammation, and conferred protection against ischemic stroke. Conclusion These findings elucidated the critical role of STING‐mediated type I interferon signaling in driving post‐stroke neuroinflammation and underscored the potential of STING inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for alleviating neuroinflammatory responses following stroke.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical for immunosurveillance yet become dysfunctional in contexts such as chronic stimulation by viral infections or cancer. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less well characterized, which limits therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, which have remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex. Results Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically improved the quality of life for people living with HIV (PLWH). However, over 4 million PLWH are over the age of fifty and experience accompanying HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). To understand how HIV impacts the central nervous system, a reliable and feasible model of HIV is necessary. Previously, a novel biological system using chimeric HIV (EcoHIV) inoculation was developed in a rat model to investigate neurocognitive impairments and synaptic dysfunction. Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains in clarifying EcoHIV's neuroanatomical distribution, particularly its differential expression in various cell types in the brain. In the current study, EcoHIV with mScarlet fluorescence labeling was modified and retro-orbitally injected into Tmem119-EGFP knock-in mice (which express enhanced green fluorescence protein primarily in microglia) to determine if microglia are the major cell type responsible for viral expression and reservoirs of HIV in the brain. The current data show that: (1) in vitro, EcoHIV-mScarlet fluorescence signals were predominantly localized in microglia-like cells among primary rodent brain cells; (2) in vivo, injection of EcoHIV-mScarlet into Tmem119-EGFP mice induced significant HIV expression in the mouse brain. The co-localization of mScarlet and EGFP signals suggests that microglia are the main cell type harboring HIV in the brain. Overall, EcoHIV in rodents offers a valuable biological system to study microglial alterations, viral reservoirs in the brain, and the neurological mechanisms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.">

This selects for latently infected cells, but also potentially for cells that express HIV but possess intrinsic CTL resistance. We demonstrate that such resistance exists in HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells that survive rigorous CTL attack and map CTL susceptibility to cell identities and states defined by single-cell multi-omics and functional metabolic profiling. Cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells were prominently overrepresented amongst survivors, as were cells with quiescent metabolic profiles and low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The induction of ROS production by treatment with deferoxamine sensitized these cells to CTL-mediated elimination. Reservoir-harboring cells from clinical samples share the above transcriptional features, being enriched for quiescent states. Our results provide an atlas for elucidating features of CTL resistance in HIV reservoirs, and identify oxidative stress as a therapeutic target to facilitate reservoir elimination.">

        <tr id="Disease-associated microglia (DAM) are observed in neurodegenerative diseases, demyelinating disorders, and aging. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and evolutionary trajectory of DAM during the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain unclear. Using a mouse model of ALS that expresses a human SOD1 gene mutation, we found that the microglia subtype DAM begins to appear following motor neuron degeneration, primarily in the brain stem and spinal cord. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNAscope in situ hybridization, and flow cytometry, we found that DAM increased in number as the disease progressed, reaching their peak in the late disease stage. DAM responded to disease progression in both SOD1G93A mice and sporadic ALS and C9orf72-mutated patients. Motor neuron loss in SOD1G93A mice exhibited 2 accelerated phases: P90 to P110 (early stage) and P130 to P150 (late stage). Some markers were synchronized with the accelerated phase of motor neuron loss, suggesting that these proteins may be particularly responsive to disease progression. Through pseudotime trajectory analysis, we tracked the dynamic transition of homeostatic microglia into DAM and cluster 6 microglia. Interestingly, we used the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 to deplete microglia in SOD1G93A mice and observed that DAM survival is independent of CSF1R. An in vitro phagocytosis assay directly confirmed that DAM could phagocytose more beads than other microglia subtypes. These findings reveal that the induction of the DAM phenotype is a shared cross-species and cross-subtype characteristic in ALS. Inducing the DAM phenotype and enhancing its function during the early phase of disease progression, or the time window between P130 and P150 where motor neuron loss slows, could serve as a neuroprotective strategy for ALS.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 can trigger hyperinflammation, leading to severe COVID-19, presenting with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure. Specific biomarkers like leukocytes, CRP, NLR, AST, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin, and IL-6 are associated with disease severity. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, has been proposed to mitigate hyperinflammation, but its clinical efficacy remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Anakinra on inflammatory biomarkers, oxygenation status, and survival outcomes in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (according to the National Institute of Health severity scale), compared to standard treatment. Methods: A retrospective analysis included 65 patients (mean age 75.51 ± 9.54 years; 58.5% male, 41.5% female) hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. Patients were divided into two groups: a control group receiving standard treatment (n = 24) and a target group treated with Anakinra (n = 41). Biomarkers and oxygenation status were assessed on Days 0, 3, and 7. Statistical analyses compared the groups for changes in leukocytes, NLR, CRP, AST, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin, and IL-6. Results: Anakinra treatment was associated with significant reductions in leukocytes, NLR, D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6, and CRP by Days 3 and 7. Improvements in oxygenation status were observed, although no survival benefits were noted. The control group showed no significant biomarker changes except for AST and LDH on Day 7. Conclusions: Anakinra demonstrated favorable effects on biomarkers and oxygenation in moderate to severe COVID-19 but did not improve survival. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.">

Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) promote inflammatory resolution and homeostasis and are thought to have specific reprogramming effects on hman microglia. Decreased SPM levels have been correlated with chronic neuroinflammation, late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuropathology in humans, yet few studies have explored the cellular signatures of resolution. Amyloid is though to bind one target resolution receptor, ChemR23, leading to internalization. In this study we explore if internalized ChemR23 receptor is part of a signaling endosome in microglial cells and how this interfaces with amyloid challenge and/or SPM mitigation.


METHOD
We then challenged human microglial cell culture models (HMC3) with amyloid-beta oligomer activation and/or administered RvE1 to promote resolution. We quantified resolution signaling responses using standard immunoblot. We measured microglial activation using immunofluorescence and cell characterization software. We examined the occurrence of ChemR23 receptor internalization and several endosomal markers by super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy.


RESULT
RvE1 significantly reduces microglial activation and cytokine expression under amyloid challenge. We discovered that RvE1 leads to compensatory response in specific G protein coupled receptors within the resolution family 2) specific signaling events 3) unique endosome signatures, We are quantifying functionality of endosomes and other objectives to share at the poster at AAIC.


CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated that RvE1 modulates inflammation in a mouse model and in a microglial cell line. Understanding the molecular signatures of resolution reprogramming in cells will be key to identifying prognostic indicators and molecular mechanisms of this unique understudied GPCR system and response in the brain.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background While dysregulated local innate immunity and microglial dysfunction are thought to play a pathogenic role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Importantly, activation of immune and metabolic pathways in myeloid cells can lead to a functional reprogramming process, termed innate immune memory (IIM), in which the response to an initial stimulus shapes long‐lasting epigenetic modifications that alter the response to future inflammatory stimuli. This epigenetic imprinting process has been minimally studied in microglia. We posit that immune activation may result in epigenetic reprogramming which contributes to sustained microglial dysfunction as a pathogenic mechanism in AD. Method We treated an in vitro primary monocyte‐derived microglial model with a range of activators of specific innate immune receptors, disease‐associated stimuli, and pathogens. We investigated whether any of these stimuli induce epigenetic remodeling using single nucleus RNA‐and ATAC‐sequencing after a washout and seven‐day rest period, and probed for alterations in AD‐associated molecular pathways. We compared the rewired epigenetic signatures we observed to ATAC‐sequencing data from human microglia from post‐mortem AD brain tissue. Result We found that three stimuli in particular resulted in unique remodeled chromatin signatures: E. coli LPS (TLR4 activator), CpG ODNs (TLR9 activator), and HSV‐1 infection. Motif enrichment identified binding sites of AD‐associated transcription factors within the differential chromatin peaks remodeled by these stimuli. For example, TLR9 activation with CpG ODNs altered chromatin accessibility of MEF2A and MEF2C binding sites, transcription factors that have been genetically associated with AD. We identified that features of the unique chromatin signatures associated with these stimuli overlap with post‐mortem microglial chromatin configuration from human AD brain tissues. Lastly, we identified the functional consequences of microglial IIM induced by these three primary stimuli upon delayed secondary stimulation, including altered cytokine response. Conclusion Microglial activation by specific inflammatory stimuli causes epigenetic rewiring, resulting in differential accessibility of AD‐associated transcription factors and altered response to future stimuli. In this way, microglial activation and IIM may later contribute to microglial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis.">

Interferon epsilon (IFNε), a unique type I interferon not induced by infection, is constitutively expressed in the female reproductive tract (FRT), where it provides broad antiviral protection and fluctuates with hormone status. The role of IFNε outside the FRT remains unclear, although it is expressed in the intestinal epithelium. We generated an IFNε knockout mouse (Ifnε-/-) and confirmed its antiviral activity in the FRT. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of the cycling mouse FRT, we show that Ifnε expression is restricted to specific epithelial cells, is not hormonally regulated, and induces basal interferon-stimulated genes in an autocrine manner. scRNASeq of WT and Ifnε-/- uteruses showed that loss of Ifnε reduced basal ISG levels in Ifnε- expressing epithelial cells without impacting other cell types. Consistent with this, IFNε was retained intracellularly in primary human FRT cells. scRNASeq of human stem cell-derived enteroids and tissue revealed that multiple GI epithelial cells express high basal IFNε levels, and Ifnε-/- mice are more susceptible to enteric viral infection. Our findings reveal that IFNε is an intracellular IFN that provides mucosal immunity across various epithelial tissues, extending its protective functions beyond the FRT.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Malaria remains a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Malaysia, the emergence of Plasmodium knowlesi has led to a surge in zoonotic malaria cases and deaths in recent years. Signs of cerebral involvement have been observed in a noncomatose, fatal case of knowlesi infection, but the potential impact of this malaria species on the brain remains unexplored. To address this gap, we investigated circulating levels of brain injury, inflammation, and vascular biomarkers in a cohort of knowlesi-infected patients and controls.


METHODS
Archived plasma samples from 19 Malaysian patients with symptomatic knowlesi infection and 19 healthy, age-matched controls were analyzed. Fifty-two biomarkers of brain injury, inflammation, and vascular activation were measured. Wilcoxon tests were used to examine group differences, and biomarker profiles were explored through hierarchical clustering heatmap analysis.


RESULTS
Bonferroni-corrected analyses revealed significantly elevated brain injury biomarker levels in knowlesi-infected patients, including S100B (P < .0001), Tau (P = .0007), UCH-L1 (P < .0001), αSyn (P < .0001), Park7 (P = .0006), NRGN (P = .0022), and TDP-43 (P = .005). Compared to controls, levels were lower in the infected group for BDNF (P < .0001), CaBD (P < .0001), CNTN1 (P < .0001), NCAM-1 (P < .0001), GFAP (P = .0013), and KLK6 (P = .0126). Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct group profiles for brain injury and vascular activation biomarkers.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings highlight for the first time a potential impact of P knowlesi infection on the brain, with specific changes in cerebral injury and endothelial activation biomarker profiles. Further studies are warranted to investigate the pathophysiology and clinical significance of these altered markers, through neuroimaging and long-term neurocognitive assessments.">

        <tr id="A shared hallmark of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is the chronic activation of innate immune cells, which actively contributes to the neurodegenerative process. In Alzheimer’s disease, this inflammatory milieu exacerbates both amyloid and tau pathology. A similar abnormal inflammatory response has been reported in Parkinson’s disease, with elevated levels of cytokines and other inflammatory intermediates derived from activated glial cells, which promote the progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Understanding the causes that support this aberrant inflammatory response has become a topic of growing interest and research in neurodegeneration, with high translational potential. It has been postulated that the phenotypic shift of immune cells towards a proinflammatory state combined with the presence of immunogenic cell death fuels a vicious cycle in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role. Mitochondria and mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species are downstream effectors of different inflammatory signaling pathways, including inflammasomes. Dysfunctional mitochondria are also recognized as important producers of damage-associated molecular patterns, which can amplify the immune response. Here, we review the major findings highlighting the role of mitochondria as a checkpoint of neuroinflammation and immunogenic cell deaths in neurodegenerative diseases. The knowledge of these processes may help to find new druggable targets to modulate the inflammatory response.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex and dynamic response of the central nervous system (CNS) to injury, infection, and disease. While acute neuroinflammation plays a protective role by facilitating pathogen clearance and tissue repair, chronic and dysregulated inflammation contributes significantly to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. This review explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and peripheral immune cells. Key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the NLRP3 inflammasome, are discussed alongside emerging regulators such as non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications, and the gut–brain axis. The therapeutic landscape is evolving, with traditional anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs and corticosteroids offering limited efficacy in chronic conditions. Immunomodulators, gene and RNA-based therapeutics, and stem cell methods have all shown promise for more specific and effective interventions. Additionally, the modulation of metabolic states and gut microbiota has emerged as a novel strategy to regulate neuroinflammation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinically viable therapies. Future studies should concentrate on integrated, interdisciplinary methods to reduce chronic neuroinflammation and slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, providing opportunities for revolutionary advances in CNS therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Introduction Long COVID (LC) poses a persistent challenge in clinical practice due to limited understanding of its etiology. LC is hypothesized to stem from aberrant immune responses in COVID-19. Vaccinations, which boost immune cells to restore function, could help ease LC symptoms. Methods To exclude the impact of vaccination, we examined the immune cell profiles of recovering COVID-19 patients before vaccines were available. White blood cell differentials were monitored in ninety-twohealthy unvaccinated controls. Seventy-six unvaccinated COVID-19 patients were monitored upon admission and on the 50th day post-symptom onset (DPSO50). Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were analyzed using flow cytometry. Results Mild cases showed no significant changes in lymphocyte counts or subsets from admission to DPSO50. By DPSO50, severe and critical cases showed almost complete recovery from lymphopenia, with critical cases having CD19+ B-cell counts approximately 45% lower than the mild group. Severe and critical cases exhibited reduced B-cell frequencies, with critical cases displaying around 48% higher natural killer (NK) cell counts. In mild cases, NK cell counts negatively correlated with B-cell counts (r=-0.528, p=0.02). Additionally, critical cases showed positive correlations between NK cell counts and CD4+ T-cell counts (r=0.83, p<0.01), and between NK cell counts and CD8+ T-cell counts (r=0.74, p<0.01). Severe cases demonstrated decreased counts of CD4+CD25+CD127lowFoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which positively correlated with B-cell counts (r=0.37, p<0.05). Discussion Our findings indicate that aberrant immune cell profiles in COVID-19 patients change dynamically during recovery, depending on disease severity. This study suggests that convalescent patients from critical COVID-19 may experience long-lasting B-cell lymphopenia.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, is a chronic inflammatory disease. Although typically associated with inflammation of the lungs and other peripheral tissues, increasing evidence has uncovered neurological consequences attributable to Mtb infection. These include deficits in memory and cognition, increased risk for neurodegenerative disease, and progressive neuropathology. Although the neurological effects of the disease, without CNS infection, have been characterized, the mechanism of neurotoxicity is unknown. We hypothesized that alterations to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) allows peripheral immune cells to enter the brain, initiating a neuroinflammatory response. To test this hypothesis, guinea pigs were exposed by aerosol to a laboratory and a clinical Mtb strain for 15 days. Following Mtb infection, proteins critical to BBB function, including claudin V and collagen IV, are modulated without evidence of bacterial dissemination to the brain. This is correlated with increased contact of astrocytic processes to vessels in the brain, as well as increased expression of the water channel protein aquaporin 4 (AQP4) on endfeet. Upon further investigation, we discovered the potential role of glial reactivity, which is increased following infection with both bacterial strains, in the progression of BBB changes and, ultimately, the permeability of peripheral immune cells into the brain. Through these data, we have obtained a preliminary understanding of the mechanisms of cellular stress in the brain following pulmonary Mtb infection which should be further investigated in future studies.">

        <tr id="Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons and persistent inflammation. Neurons are terminally differentiated cells, and lost neurons cannot be replaced since neurogenesis is restricted to only two neurogenic niches in the adult brain, whose neurogenic potential decreases with age. In this regard, the astrocytes reprogramming into neurons may represent a promising strategy for restoring the lost neurons and rebuilding neural circuits. To date, many anti-inflammatory agents have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation; however, their potential to restore neuronal loss was poorly investigated. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory effects of lactoferrin on DI-TNC1 astrocyte cell line and its ability to induce astrocyte reprogramming in a context of sustained inflammation. For this purpose, astrocytes were pre-treated with lactoferrin (4 μg/mL) for 24 h, then with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (400 ng/mL), and examined 2, 9 and 16 days from treatment. The results demonstrate that lactoferrin attenuates astrocyte reactivity by reducing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and IL-6 expression, as well as by upregulating Interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokine and NRF2 expression. Moreover, lactoferrin promotes the reprogramming of reactive astrocytes into proliferative neuroblasts by inducing the overexpression of the Sex determining region Y/SRY-box 2 (SOX2) reprogramming transcription factor. Overall, this study highlights the potential effects of lactoferrin to attenuate neuroinflammation and improve neurogenesis, suggesting a future strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.">

        <tr id="Abstract Aging is the greatest risk factor for many chronic degenerative diseases, for example osteoarthritis, dementia and heart disease. This robs individuals of quality of life and is very costly to treat. This has led to great interest in finding rational strategies for extending health span, the years of disease-free life at the end of one’s lifespan. Theoretically, if we could treat aging itself, all of the diseases associated with old age would be prevented, delayed or attenuated simultaneously. Thus, discovering fundamental mechanisms of aging is a priority. Aging is generally thought to be driven by an accumulation of damage in cells over time. The progressive decline of immune function with age, known as immunosenescence, plays a pivot role in not only the aging process but also susceptibility to infections and reduced vaccine responses. Thus it is critical to find interventions to potentially correct the age-related deficits in immune function. The potent mTOR inhibitor rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan in mice and reduce age-related pathologies. Over the past decade the use of rapamycin or analogs of rapamycin have been investigated for its ability to rejuvenate aged immune systems. Treatment of elderly human participants with a rapalog was able to significantly enhance antibody titer levels to the annual influenza vaccination as well as reduce immune exhaustion markers. I was able to recapitulate some of these findings in a mouse model of immune aging. However, which immune cell populations are benefited from rapamycin treatment remains to be seen. My working hypothesis is that rapamycin is able to restore function to aged T cells and possibly other immune cell types. In order to test this hypothesis 18-month-old WT C57BL/6 mice were placed onto chow containing encapsulated rapamycin (126 ppm) or control chow for 7 months. Spleens were harvested from these mice and 5-month-old young control mice (n=3-4 per sex per group). Splenic samples are currently undergoing single-nuclei RNA sequencing to investigate the effect of rapamycin on gene expression changes in different immune cell populations of the spleen and address the following questions: Question 1: What are the differences in gene expression profiles in the different immune cell populations between young versus old splenic samples? Question 2: Does treatment with rapamycin in old mice restore a more “youthful” expression profile to all immune cell types or just a subset of them? Question 3: Are there sex-based differences in the gene expression patterns of aged immune cells or in response to rapamycin treatment?">

        <tr id="Inflammation and microglia appear to be key factors influencing the outcome of retinal regeneration following acute retinal damage. Despite such findings, direct connection of microglia-specific inflammatory factors as drivers of regenerative responses in the retina are still not defined, and intracellular pathways activated to stimulate such signals from microglia are currently unknown. We became interested in MyD88 regulation in microglia because transcriptomic datasets suggest myd88 could be regulated temporally in zebrafish microglia responding to damage in the central nervous system. MyD88 is an intracellular molecular adaptor that initiates signaling cascades downstream of several innate immune receptors, and probably most well-known for inducing gene expression of pro-inflammatory factors. Using zebrafish, which spontaneously regenerate retinal neurons after acute retinal damage, we studied the effects of overactivation of MyD88 signaling in microglia and macrophages on the Müller glia-mediated regenerative response. Our results indicate that increased MyD88 signaling in microglia/macrophages impacts the initial response of Müller glia entering a regenerative response after acute, neurotoxin-induced retinal damage to inner retinal neurons. In addition, increased MyD88 signaling in microglia/macrophages resulted in reduced survival of inner retinal neurons in regenerated retinas. This work supports the idea that temporal control of inflammatory signaling is a key component in the production of MG-derived progenitors yet further indicates that such control is important for differentiation and survival of regenerated neurons.">

        <tr id="Recently, immune function assessment has gained prominence in clinical settings. Immune functional assays (IFAs), involving in vitro stimulation, offer a relevant approach to complement traditional immunomonitoring methods which, while widely used, do not fully capture functional immune capabilities. Despite growing interest in IFAs, their added value remains unclear. To address this gap, our study aimed to determine if insights from IFAs could be replicated with unstimulated immunoprofiling. Using the same analytical pipeline, we compared transcriptomic profiles (Nanostring) between stimulated (TruCulture) and unstimulated (PaxGene) samples from i) patients with an overstimulated immune system 3-4 days post-sepsis onset, and ii) patients undergoing immune reconstitution 6-months post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In sepsis, post-stimulation transcriptomic profiles revealed immune clusters linked to disease severity and outcomes, surpassing traditional markers like mHLA-DR, while baseline analyses failed to generate clinically relevant stratification. Similarly, allo-HSCT patients' post-stimulation data revealed immune heterogeneity and treatment-related alterations not detected using baseline transcriptomic or cellular profiles alone. Our findings emphasize the value of IFAs in uncovering functional immune alterations that unstimulated assessments may miss, which could offer deeper insights into immune dysfunction. This study supports IFAs as complementary tools to current clinical practices, enhancing patient management with a functional view of immune system dynamics.">

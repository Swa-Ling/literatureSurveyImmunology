        <tr id="The emergence of COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presented a global health challenge since its identification in December 2019. With clinical manifestations ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe multi-organ dysfunction, COVID-19 continues to affect populations worldwide. The complex interactions between SARS-CoV-2 variants and the human immune system are crucial for developing effective therapies, vaccines, and preventive measures. Understanding these immune responses highlights the intricate nature of COVID-19 pathogenesis. This retrospective study analyzed, by flow cytometry approach, a cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the initial pandemic waves from 2020 to 2021. It focused on untreated individuals at the time of hospital admission and examined the presence of TR3-56 cells in their immune profiles during the anti-viral immune response. Our findings provide additional insights into the complex immunological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential role of TR3-56 cells as crucial components of the immune response. We suggest that TR3-56 cells could serve as valuable biomarkers for identifying more severe cases of COVID-19, aiding in the assessment and management of the disease.">

        <tr id="Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, variants have emerged with increased mutations and immune evasive capabilities. This has led to breakthrough infections (BTI) in vaccinated individuals, with a large proportion of the neutralizing antibody response targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein. Immune imprinting, where prior exposure of an antigen to the immune system can influence the response to subsequent exposures, and its role in a population with heterogenous exposure histories has important implications in future vaccine design. Here, we develop an accessible approach to map epitope immunodominance of the neutralizing antibody response in sera. By using a panel of mutant Spike in a pseudovirus neutralization assay, we observed distinct epitope usage in convalescent donors infected during wave 1, or infected with the Delta, or BA.1 variants, highlighting the antigenic diversity of the variant Spikes. Analysis of longitudinal serum samples taken spanning 3 doses of vaccine and subsequent breakthrough infection (BTI), showed the influence of immune imprinting from the ancestral-based vaccine, where reactivation of existing B cells elicited by the vaccine resulted in the enrichment of the pre-existing epitope immunodominance. However, subtle shifts in epitope usage in sera were observed following BTI by Omicron sub-lineage variants. Antigenic distance of Spike, time after last exposure, and number of vaccine boosters may play a role in the persistence of imprinting from the vaccine. This study provides insight into RBD neutralizing epitope usage in individuals with varying exposure histories and has implications for design of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Author Summary Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants has resulted in a rise in breakthrough infections (BTIs). Infection with different variants has led to varying exposure histories in the general population. Although the neutralizing response to Spike has been thoroughly characterized, with several key epitopes identified, there is a lack of knowledge of the proportion each epitope contributes to the neutralizing response in sera and how this is affected by exposure history. Here, we use a panel of mutant Spike pseudoviruses to screen epitope usage and immunodominance in polyclonal sera. In a cohort of unvaccinated donors infected with different variants, distinct epitope usage was observed, highlighting the antigenic diversity between the variant Spikes. Furthermore, samples collected spanning multiple vaccine doses and BTI showed the influence of prior immunity from the vaccine on epitope usage. Although a large proportion of the immune response following BTI could be attributed to enrichment of pre-existing immunodominance from the vaccine, subtle shifts in epitope usage were observed with infection by more mutated variants. This work gives more detailed insight into differences in the neutralizing response of individuals with varying exposure histories that may inform next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory immune response. Monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been observed in monocytes of patients with COVID-19, but the mechanism and consequences of inflammasome activation require further investigation. In this study, we inoculated a macrophage-like THP-1 cell line, primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, and primary monocytes with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages does not rely on viral replication, receptor-mediated entry, or actin-dependent entry. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hNEC cultures without triggering the production of inflammasome cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. Importantly, these cytokines did not inhibit viral replication in hNEC cultures. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of primary monocytes led to inflammasome activation and induced a macrophage phenotype in these cells. Monocytic cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not from peripheral blood, of patients with COVID-19, showed evidence of inflammasome activation, expressed the proinflammatory marker CD11b, and displayed oxidative burst. These findings highlight the central role of activated macrophages, as a result of direct viral sensing, in COVID-19 and support the inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 as potential therapeutic strategies to reduce immunopathology without increasing viral replication.


IMPORTANCE
Inflammasome activation is associated with severe COVID-19. The impact of inflammasome activation on viral replication and mechanistic details of this activation are not clarified. This study advances our understanding of the role of inflammasome activation in macrophages by identifying TLR2, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 as dependent factors in this activation. Further, it highlights that SARS-CoV-2 inflammasome activation is not a feature of nasal epithelial cells but rather activation of bystander macrophages in the airway. Finally, we demonstrate that two pro inflammatory cytokines produced by inflammasome activation, IL-18 and IL-1β, do not restrict viral replication and are potential targets to ameliorate pathological inflammation in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include myocardial injury, heart failure, and myocarditis and are associated with long-term disability and mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and antigens are found in the myocardium of COVID-19 patients, and human cardiomyocytes are susceptible to infection in cell or organoid cultures. While these observations raise the possibility that cardiomyocyte infection may contribute to the cardiac sequelae of COVID-19, a causal relationship between cardiomyocyte infection and myocardial dysfunction and pathology has not been established. Here, we generated a mouse model of cardiomyocyte-restricted infection by selectively expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in cardiomyocytes. Inoculation of Myh6-Cre Rosa26loxP-STOP-loxP-hACE2 mice with an ancestral, non-mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in viral replication within the heart, accumulation of macrophages, and moderate left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Cardiac pathology in this model was transient and resolved with viral clearance. Blockade of monocyte trafficking reduced macrophage accumulation, suppressed the development of LV systolic dysfunction, and promoted viral clearance in the heart. These findings establish a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 cardiomyocyte infection that recapitulates features of cardiac dysfunctions of COVID-19 and suggests that both viral replication and resultant innate immune responses contribute to cardiac pathology.IMPORTANCEHeart involvement after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurs in multiple ways and is associated with worse outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. It remains unclear if cardiac disease is driven by primary infection of the heart or immune response to the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is capable of entering contractile cells of the heart in a culture dish. However, it remains unclear how such infection affects the function of the heart in the body. Here, we designed a mouse in which only heart muscle cells can be infected with a SARS-CoV-2 strain to study cardiac infection in isolation from other organ systems. In our model, infected mice show viral infection, worse function, and accumulation of immune cells in the heart. A subset of immune cells facilitates such worsening heart function. As this model shows features similar to those observed in patients, it may be useful for understanding the heart disease that occurs as a part of COVID-19.">

 The immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are still under investigation. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild in the pediatric population, some children develop severe clinical manifestations or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after infection. MIS-C, typically emerging 2-6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, is characterized by a hyperinflammatory response affecting multiple organs. This review aims to explore the complex landscape of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, focusing on innate, T cell-, and B cell-mediated immunity, and discusses the role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a superantigen in MIS-C pathophysiology. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving the management and outcomes for affected children.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the impact of viral infections on individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Initial observations suggested lower COVID-19 rates among CF populations; however, subsequent clinical data have presented a more complex scenario. This study aimed to investigate how bronchial epithelial cells from CF and non-CF individuals, including various CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations, respond to in vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV. Comparisons with the Influenza A virus (IAV) were included based on evidence that CF patients experience heightened morbidity from IAV infection. Our findings showed that CF epithelial cells exhibited reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2, regardless of the type of CFTR mutation or SARS-CoV-2 variant, as well as the original 2003 SARS-Cove. In contrast, these cells displayed more efficient IAV replication compared to non-CF cells. Interestingly, the reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in CF was not linked to the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor nor to CFTR dysfunction, as pharmacological treatments to restore CFTR function did not normalize the viral response. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and CFTR function influenced the levels of certain cytokines and chemokines, although these effects were not correlated. Overall, this study reveals a unique viral response in CF epithelial cells, characterized by reduced replication for some viruses like SARS-CoV-2, while showing increased susceptibility to others such as IAV. This research offers a new perspective on CF and viral interactions, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these differences.

Although research into underlying mechanisms is evolving, immunity is understudied. As the recall of T cell memory promotes more rapid recovery and ameliorates disease outcomes, establishment of robust memory T cells is important for protection against subsequent infections, even when the virus mutates. We defined how SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and B cell responses are established and maintained following infection and vaccination for 2 y in people with long COVID.

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented global challenges with a diverse clinical spectrum, including severe respiratory complications and systemic effects. This review explores the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, aging, and obesity in COVID-19. Mitochondria are vital for cellular energy provision and resilience against age-related macromolecule damage accumulation. They manage energy allocation in cells, activating adaptive responses and stress signals such as redox imbalance and innate immunity activation. As organisms age, mitochondrial function diminishes. Aging and obesity, linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, compromise the antiviral response, affecting the release of interferons, and worsening COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, the development of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID has been associated with altered energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation derived from mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the interplay between mitochondria, aging, obesity, and viral infections provides insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. Targeting mitochondrial health may offer potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate severe outcomes and address long-term consequences in infected individuals.">

This infection model recapitulates breathing-like stretch and culture of epithelial cells at the air–liquid interface and resulted in clinically relevant cytopathic effects including cell rounding of alveolar type 2 cells and disruption of the tight junction protein occludin. Viral replication was confirmed by immunocytochemical nucleocapsid staining in the epithelium and increased shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus within 2 days post-infection, associated with changes in innate host immune responses. Together, these data demonstrate that, under the experimental conditions used in this work, this human alveolus MPS chip can successfully model SARS-CoV-2 infection of human alveolar lung cells.">

        <tr id="One possible determinant of COVID-19 severity is immune imprinting (IP) by Common Cold Coronavirus (CCCV). As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns. Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.">

        <tr id="Few therapeutic options are available to treat COVID-19. The KEAP1/NRF2 pathway, the major redox-responsive pathway, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 as it regulates redox homeostasis and inflammation that are altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we characterized the effects of NRF2-agonist Sulfodyne®, a stabilized natural Sulforaphane, in cellular and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In pulmonary or colonic epithelial cell lines, Sulfodyne® elicited a more efficient inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication than NRF2-agonists DMF and CDDO. This antiviral activity was not dependent on NRF2 but was associated with the regulation of several metabolic pathways, including the inhibition of ER stress and mTOR signaling, which are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sulfodyne® also decreased SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the delayed induction of IFNB1 and type I IFN-stimulated genes in infected epithelial cell lines and by reducing the activation of human by-stander monocytes recruited after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, Sulfodyne® treatment reduced both early lung viral load and disease severity by fine-tuning IFN-beta levels. Altogether, these results provide evidence for multiple mechanisms that underlie the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of Sulfodyne® and pinpoint Sulfodyne® as a potent therapeutic agent against pathogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is characterized by its high transmissibility, which has caused a worldwide epidemiological event. Yet, it turns ominous once the disease progression degenerates into severe pneumonia and sepsis, presenting a horrendous lethality. To elucidate the alveolar immune or inflammatory landscapes of Omicron critical-ill patients, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with critical pneumonia caused by Omicron infection, and analyzed the correlation between the clinical severity scores and different immune cell subpopulations. In the BALF of Omicron critical patients, the alveolar violent myeloid inflammatory environment was determined. ISG15+ neutrophils and CXCL10+ macrophages, both expressed the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), were negatively correlated with clinical pulmonary infection score, while septic CST7+ neutrophils and inflammatory VCAN+ macrophages were positively correlated with sequential organ failure assessment. The percentages of ISG15+ neutrophils were associated with more protective alveolar epithelial cells, and may reshape CD4+ T cells to the exhaustive phenotype, thus preventing immune injuries. The CXCL10+ macrophages may promote plasmablast/plasma cell survival and activation as well as the production of specific antibodies. As compared to the previous BALF scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 wild-type/Alpha critical patients, the subsets of neutrophils and macrophages with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features presented obvious distinctions, suggesting an immune disparity in Omicron variants. Overall, this study provides a BALF single-cell atlas of Omicron critical patients, and suggests that alveolar interferon-responsive neutrophils and macrophages may extricate SARS-CoV-2 Omicron critical patients from the nasty fate of sepsis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) preferentially infects the respiratory tract; however, several studies have implicated a multi-organ involvement. Hepatic dysfunctions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been increasingly recognized and described to correlate with disease severity. To elucidate molecular factors that could contribute towards hepatic infection, we concentrated on microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that modulate various cellular processes and which are reported to be differentially regulated during liver injury. We aimed to study the infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) with SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the potential of miRNAs for modulating viral infection.


METHODS
We analysed liver autopsies from a coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-positive cohort for the presence of viral RNA using Nanopore sequencing. PHH were used for the infection with SARS-CoV-2. The candidate miRNAs targeting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were identified using in silico approaches. To discover the potential regulatory mechanism, transfection experiments, qRT-PCRs, western blots and luciferase reporter assays were performed.


RESULTS
We could detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19-positive liver autopsies. We show that PHH express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and can be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulting in robust replication. Transfection of selected miRNA mimics reduced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression and SARS-CoV-2 burden in PHH. In silico and biochemical analyses supported a potential direct binding of miR-141-3p to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.


CONCLUSION
We confirm that PHH are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate selected miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and/or the viral genome reduce viral loads. These data provide novel insights into hepatic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and associated dysfunctions in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, triggers a series of immune responses in the host organism. These responses, while essential for pathogen elimination, can also cause significant damage to host tissues. This work details the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, from its structure to the processes of viral entry and replication, as well as the mechanisms related to infection and activation of the immune system, which can culminate in a cytokine storm. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies, vaccines, and alternative therapies that were urgently released during the pandemic. Continuous research, especially related to the immune response, is necessary to enhance knowledge and preparedness for future pandemics.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has confirmed that the ability to rapidly mutate may be extremely beneficial for a virus. Not long after the first wave, new variants emerged with altered infectivity, disease severity, and mortality. These new strains most notably had numerous mutations of the spike (S) protein, a surface protein responsible for binding to and entering the host cell. The Delta and Omicron strains demonstrated increased immune evasion and improved binding affinity to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This study examines the ability of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 IgG to bind Delta and Omicron antigens, as well as their functional binding capabilities to two different S-ACE2 complexes. Twenty SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from patients who had recovered from infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in the first wave of COVID-19 and 10 pre-pandemic control samples were studied. SARS-CoV-2 exposed patients showed significantly higher levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD (p < 0.001), N protein (p < 0.001), and Omicron spike variant (p = 0.01), but not to Delta spike variant (p = 0.966) when compared with controls. Furthermore, patient samples showed significantly greater inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 binding (p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Conversely, there was no correlation between the binding inhibition of S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 receptor. This study shows there is considerable cross-reactivity of IgG generated by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Delta and Omicron variants.">

        <tr id="Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) is a common human neurotropic virus with the majority of adults harboring latent-recurrent infections. In rare cases, HSV-1 infection can access the central nervous system through the neuronal route and develop into life-threatening encephalitis. Here, we used a mouse model for HSV-1 infection to describe the transcriptomic profile of the infected brain stem at the single-cell level and with temporal resolution. Among resident brain cells, microglia increased in proportion during the course of infection, while astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cell levels decrease. At the levels of peripheral immune cells, we found notably monocytes to strongly influx the infected brain. Large dynamic changes were found in the abundance of subpopulations of the different cell types following virus infection. For instance, we identify one subpopulation of microglia exhibiting very high type I interferon and chemokine expression early during infection. This population was also enriched for viral transcripts, suggesting localization at foci of infection, and orchestrating recruitment of other immune cells. In contrast, for the infiltrating monocytes, we identified a larger panel of unique subpopulations with antiviral and inflammatory phenotypes, and found not all of these being highly positive for viral transcripts, thus indicating monocyte activities beyond the infected brain areas. Finally, investigation of endothelial cell cross-talk with other cell types revealed that cytokines derived from microglia and monocyte, but also T cells, contribute to disturbance of the blood brain barrier. Our work thus reveals for the first time the complex nature of the cellular response in the virus-infected brain, which seeks to eliminate infection but can also prime for pathological changes.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infects via the respiratory tract, but COVID-19 includes an array of non-respiratory symptoms, among them gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as vomiting and diarrhea. Here we investigated the GI pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in rhesus macaques and humans. Macaques experienced mild infection with USA-WA1/2020 and shed viral RNA in the respiratory tract and stool, including subgenomic RNA indicative of replication in the GI tract. Intestinal immune cell populations were disturbed, with significantly fewer proliferating (Ki67+) jejunal B cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques than uninfected ones. Modest translocation of bacteria/bacterial antigen was observed across the colonic epithelium, with a corresponding significant increase in plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) that may be induced by LPS. Human plasma demonstrated significant decreases in interleukin (IL)-6 and sCD14 upon recovery from COVID-19, suggesting resolution of inflammation and response to translocated bacteria. sCD14 significantly positively correlated with zonulin, an indicator of gut barrier integrity, and IL-6. These results demonstrate that GI perturbations such as microbial translocation can occur in even mild SARS-CoV-2 infections and may contribute to the COVID-19 inflammatory state.IMPORTANCEThis study investigates gastrointestinal (GI) barrier disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infections and how it may contribute to disease. We observed bacteria or bacterial products crossing from the colon interior (the lumen) to the lamina propria during SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. Bacteria/bacterial products are tolerated in the lumen but may induce immune responses if they translocate to the lamina propria. We also observed a significant increase in soluble CD14, which is associated with an immune response to bacterial products. In addition, we observed that humans recovering from COVID-19 experienced a significant decrease in soluble CD14, as well as the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 and sCD14 correlated significantly across macaque and human samples. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in GI barrier disruption that permits microbial translocation and a corresponding immune response. These findings could aid in developing interventions to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes.">

Herein, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to study the binding dynamics between the virus and cell membrane. Our findings revealed that the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs) exhibited a slightly stronger affinity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor compared with the Delta variant and was significantly higher than the wild-type (WT). Using a real-time force-tracing technique, we quantified the dynamic parameters for a single SARS-CoV-2 VLP entry into cells, showing that approximately 200 ms and 60 pN are required. The parameters aligned with the analysis obtained from coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations. Additionally, the Omicron variant invades cells at a higher entry cell speed, smaller force, and higher probability. Furthermore, single-particle fluorescence tracking visually demonstrated clathrin-dependent endocytosis for SARS-CoV-2 entry into A549 cells. The dynamic features of endocytosis provide valuable insights into the SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism and possible intervention strategies targeting the viral infection process.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection often exhibit significant changes in T cells, particularly a reduction in CD4+T and CD8+T cells in peripheral blood, which has become a key feature of severe respiratory infection. These immune changes in T lymphocytes are closely associated with disease progression, but the specific mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further investigation. This paper reviewed the changes in the number and function of T cells in respiratory viral infections, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2, and summarized related therapeutic explorations. We believe that improving and enhancing the number and function of T lymphocytes in infected hosts is a promising strategy for the treatment of respiratory viral infections, although more systematic and in-depth scientific research is still needed.">

        <tr id="Patients with hematological malignancies (HMs) are at high risk of respiratory viral infections due to the intrinsic deterioration of the immune system and chemotherapy treatments. In the recent past, SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral infection has been responsible for most infectious complications in HMs. We analyzed 2950 samples from 505 patients admitted to the Hematology department from 2019 to 2023. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological trend of respiratory viruses in the SARS-CoV-2 era, the characteristics of the patients involved and their outcomes. In our analysis, we found a reduction in non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral (NSRV) positivity during the pandemic period, although these data did not show statistical significance. Most of the HMs involved were Multiple Myeloma and Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Overall mortality rate was very low and characterized by the progression of the HMs as well as the worsening of respiratory failure. In conclusion, a reduction in non-COVID viral infections was highlighted, probably also thanks to the increase in prevention measures and environmental modifications of the viral background.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever, is an emerging respiratory disease caused by soil dwelling fungi of the Coccidioides genus that is expected to spread from the southwest into the central U.S. by 2050. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the other 40% of patients experience a range of symptoms, from self-limiting pneumonia to life-threatening disseminated disease. The immunological events that underlie the progression to severe disease remain under defined. Here, we probed the early immune response to Coccidioides using a high dose of an attenuated strain of C. posadasii in a mouse model of infection coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing. At 24 hours post-infection, robust immune infiltration is detected in the lung, marked by high levels of inflammatory PD-L1+ neutrophils and fungal-contact dependent pro-fibrotic Spp1+ macrophages. These findings elucidate the early dynamics of the host response to Coccidioides and provide a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the lung. Importance By examining early immune dynamics in the lungs, we uncover critical insights into how myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, are recruited and differentiated during Coccidioides infection. The discovery of specific immune cell subsets, such as PD-L1+ neutrophils and Spp1+ macrophages, which are associated with inflammation and fibrosis, highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interactions that occur during Coccidioides infection, offering valuable directions for developing more effective treatments and preventive strategies against this increasingly prevalent disease.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the subsequent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised questions about its impact on pediatric asthma. This review analyzes the latest research to offer a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between COVID-19 and pediatric asthma.


AREAS COVERED
This narrative review examines the effects of COVID-19 on pediatric asthma, exploring clinical outcomes, immune responses, recommended treatments, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and COVID-19 vaccination. Data were sourced from databases (PubMed, Embase, and BioRxiv/MedRxiv) from January 2020 to November 2023.


EXPERT OPINION
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the international scientific community rapidly developed extensive knowledge, demonstrating unprecedented cooperation. Despite these advances, questions remain about SARS-CoV-2 infection and pediatric asthma. Most research consists of epidemiological studies with varying methods, sometimes yielding contradictory results. While asthma generally did not increase the risk of severe COVID-19 in children, uncontrolled asthma was a risk factor, highlighting the importance of maintaining asthma management. Telemedicine has proven effective for asthma control and will continue to grow, despite its limitations. Notably, allergic asthma may have a protective role against severe COVID-19. We recommend COVID-19 vaccination in the pediatric age group, including those with asthma.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains endemic worldwide ∼5 years since the first documented case. Severe COVID-19 is widely considered to be caused by a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 within the respiratory tract. Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged 4-6 month old C57BL/6 mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice 4 days post infection and before death were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in the lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The unprecedented research effort associated with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) included several extensive proteomic studies that identified host proteins that interact with individual viral gene products. However, in most cases, the consequences of those virus–host interactions for virus replication were not experimentally pursued, which is a necessary step in determining whether the interactions represent pro- or anti-viral events. One putative interaction commonly identified in multiple studies was between the host adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) subunit B1 (AP3B1) and the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E). AP3B1 is one subunit of AP-3 required for the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles (LROs), and its function impacts important disease processes including inflammation and vascular health. Thus, interactions between AP3B1 and SARS-CoV-2 might influence the clinical outcomes of infection. To determine if AP3B1 has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, we first confirmed the interaction in virus-infected cells using immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). AP3B1 is required by multiple viruses to aid in the replication cycle and therefore may be a therapeutic target. However, we found that the overexpression of AP3B1 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas the siRNA-mediated depletion of AP3B1 increased the release of infectious virus, suggesting an antiviral role for AP3B1. Together, our findings suggest that AP3B1 is an intrinsic barrier to SARS-CoV-2 replication through interactions with the viral E protein. Our work justifies further investigations of LRO trafficking in SARS-CoV-2 target cells and their role in viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a crucial role in regulation of immune response. It is believed that excessive activity of Treg cells in the early stages of infectious diseases reduces the pro-inflammatory activity of cells in the innate and adaptive immune response, thereby contributing to the development of chronic inflammation or excessive inflammation. Additionally, it is known that aging leads to changes in the quantity of Treg cells and disrupts their activity. It is established that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to fatal and severe cases of the disease, primarily among the elderly population. However, the underlying cause of the development of severe forms in elderly individuals remains incompletely understood. Thus, we hypothesized that the dysregulation of the Treg cell activity in elderly individuals may contribute to the development of severe forms and lethality from SARS-CoV-2, leading to the emergence of hyper inflammation in this population. 
To investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the immunosuppressive properties of Treg cells, venous blood samples were obtained from young healthy volunteers and elderly individuals. Dendritic cells were obtained by PBMC adhesion on plastic. Adherent monocytes were cultured in cytokine medium with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-SCF), with addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after 48 hours and incubated for an additional 24 hours with S1 or N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The obtained dendritic cells presenting SARS-CoV-2 antigens were then co-cultured with autologous CD4+-T lymphocytes ex vivo. The expression level of immunosuppressive membrane-associated and soluble molecules expressed by Treg cells was assessed using flow cytometry. 
Our results indicate that the immunosuppressive activity of Treg cells exhibits contrasting patterns in the two donor groups studied in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The proportion of Treg cells, as well as the expression levels of the immunosuppressive molecules, including tumor growth factor beta (TGF-b), CD39, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related (GITR) protein, and the levels of the intracellular immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-35, in Treg cells obtained from peripheral blood of elderly donors, significantly increased in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo, when compared to the group of young donors. Conversely, in the group of young donors were observed a decrease in the expression of these markers and an increase in the concentration of extracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ ex vivo, which activate the effector immune cells and contribute to virus elimination. 
In summary, the presented results suggest that Treg cells derived from elderly individuals exhibit elevated immunosuppressive activity in response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo. Obtained results may indicate that in elderly individuals on the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection Treg cells may also possess enhanced immunosuppressive activity, which may contribute to the overall suppression of anti-viral immune responses, thereby potentially leading to the delayed SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance and development of severe forms of the disease.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in vaccination and therapies for coronavirus disease, challenges remain due to reduced antibody longevity and the emergence of virulent variants like Omicron (BA.1) and its subvariants (BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3, and BA.5). This study explored the potential of adoptive immunotherapy and harnessing the protective abilities using virus-specific T cells (VSTs). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) VSTs were generated by stimulating donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells with spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane protein peptide mixtures. Phenotypic characterization, including T-cell receptor (TCR) vβ and pentamer analyses, was performed on the ex vivo-expanded cells. We infected human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-partially matched human Calu-3 cells with various authentic SARS-CoV-2 strains in a Biosafety Level 3 facility and co-cultured them with VSTs. VSTs exhibited a diverse TCR vβ repertoire, confirming their ability to target a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens from both the ancestral and mutant strains, including Omicron BA.1 and BA.5. These ex vivo-expanded cells exhibited robust cytotoxicity and low alloreactivity against HLA-partially matched SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Their cytotoxic effects were consistent across variants, targeting conserved spike and nucleocapsid epitopes. Our findings suggest that third-party partial HLA-matching VSTs could counter immune-escape mechanisms posed by emerging variants of concern.">

        <tr id="Parechovirus ahumpari 3 (HPeV-3), is among the main agents causing severe neonatal neurological infections such as encephalitis and meningitis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and changes to the host cellular landscape leading to neurological disease has been understudied. Through quantitative proteomic analysis of HPeV-3 infected neural organoids, we identified unique metabolic changes following HPeV-3 infection that indicate immunometabolic dysregulation. Protein and pathway analyses showed significant alterations in neurotransmission and potentially, neuronal excitotoxicity. Elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and neurofilament light (NfL) confirmed glutamate excitotoxicity to be a key mechanism contributing to neuronal toxicity in HPeV-3 infection and can lead to apoptosis induced by caspase signaling. These insights are pivotal in delineating the metabolic landscape following severe HPeV-3 CNS infection and may identify potential host targets for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="As obligate parasites, viruses need to hijack resources from infected cells to complete their lifecycle. The interaction between the virus and host determines the viral infection process, including viral propagation and the disease’s outcome. Understanding the interaction between the virus and host factors is a basis for unraveling the intricate biological processes in the infected cells and thereby developing more efficient and targeted antivirals. Among the various fundamental virus–host interactions, autophagy plays vital and also complicated roles by directly engaging in the viral lifecycle and functioning as an anti- and/or pro-viral factor. Autophagy thus becomes a promising target against virus infection. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an accumulation of studies aiming to investigate the roles of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection by using different models and from distinct angles, providing valuable information for systematically and comprehensively dissecting the interplay between autophagy and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we summarize the advancements in the studies of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and autophagy, as well as detailed molecular mechanisms. We also update the current knowledge on the pharmacological strategies used to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication through remodeling autophagy. These extensive studies on SARS-CoV-2 and autophagy can advance our understanding of virus–autophagy interaction and provide insights into developing efficient antiviral therapeutics by regulating autophagy.">

        <tr id="There is a complex interplay between viral infection and host innate immune response regarding disease severity and outcomes. Neutrophil hyperactivation, including excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is linked to exacerbated disease in acute COVID-19, notably in hospitalized patients. Delineating protective versus detrimental neutrophil responses is essential to developing targeted COVID-19 therapies and relies on high-quality translational animal models. In this study, we utilize a previously established feline model for COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil dysfunction in which experimentally infected cats develop clinical disease that mimics acute COVID-19. Specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2; Delta variant) (n = 24) or vehicle (n = 6). Plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues were collected at various time points over 12 days post-inoculation. Systematic and temporal evaluation of the kinetics of neutrophil activation was conducted by measuring markers of activation including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cats at 4 and 12 days post-inoculation (dpi) and compared to vehicle-inoculated controls. Cytokine profiling supported elevated innate inflammatory responses with specific upregulation of neutrophil activation and NET formation-related markers, namely IL-8, IL-18, CXCL1, and SDF-1, in infected cats. An increase in MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free dsDNA in infected cats compared to vehicle-inoculated was noted and supported by histopathologic severity in respiratory tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses further supported correlation of NET markers with tissue damage, especially 4 dpi. Differential gene expression analyses indicated an upregulation of genes associated with innate immune and neutrophil activation pathways. Transcripts involved in activation and NETosis pathways were upregulated by 4 dpi and downregulated by 12 dpi, suggesting peak activation of neutrophils and NET-associated markers in the early acute stages of infection. Correlation analyses conducted between NET-specific markers and clinical scores as well as histopathologic scores support association between neutrophil activation and disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model. Overall, this study emphasizes the effect of neutrophil activation and NET release in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a feline model, prompting further investigation into therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating excessive innate inflammatory responses in COVID-19.">

A cohort of 121 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals exhibiting varying disease states were prospectively evaluated for lymphopenic profiles, anti-viral humoral responses and infecting viral variants for a period of up to 90 days spanning the period, February 2021-January 2022 (2nd and 3rd waves of infection). A total of 51 participants received at least one vaccine dose of indigenous vaccines (Covishield or Covaxin) prior to recruitment. When stratified in terms of mortality, B and NK cells, in contrast to the T cell compartment, did not recover from nadir levels in non-survivors who were largely unvaccinated. No discriminatory signature was identified for non-survivors in terms of anti-NC or anti-S1-RBD IgG CLIA profiles including GenScript S1-RBD assays. Evaluation of sVCAM and sMAdCAM revealed opposing dynamics that correlated with disease severity and convalescence respectively. Viral variant analysis revealed delta and omicron variants to comprise majority of the infections which reflected national transmission kinetics during the period of recruitment. Our results demonstrate the importance of monitoring circulating biomarkers for convalescence as well as mortality in COVID-19 progression. Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 clearly demonstrated increased pathogenicity and warrants sustained viral surveillance for re-emergence of these strains. Our findings with respect to vaccination advocate for continued vaccine development and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.">

        <tr id="Several comorbidities and illnesses have emerged after the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of vaccination based on a slightly modified SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. One of these diseases is epilepsy, where the dysfunctional RAS plays a crucial role in the propagation of the disorder. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by utilizing the angiotensin-converting enzyme Type 2 (ACE2) receptor, which allows the virus to infect various cell types, including those in the lungs, nasopharynx, kidneys, lymph nodes, small intestine, stomach, spleen, and brain, leading to widespread organ damage. Once SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, it can lead to the overactivation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis. Consequently, higher levels of Ang II activate several deleterious pathways that promote inflammation, contributing to inflammatory responses in the body and exacerbating conditions such as seizures. Additionally, the excitatory effect of AT1R by Ang II excess due to ACE2 inhibition by SARS-CoV-2 or by the vaccine Spike protein may play a further role in the mechanism contributing to epilepsy.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable respiratory virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Since its emergence in the early 2000s, SARS has posed significant public health challenges and continues to be a concern. This review provides an overview of current treatment strategies for SARS-CoV and explores the potential utility of herbal molecules in combating this viral infection. The primary treatment approach for SARS-CoV has historically centered on supportive care, which includes oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and antipyretic medications to manage symptoms. However, with the ongoing advancement of medical research and our evolving understanding of the virus, several antiviral drugs have been developed and repurposed to target SARS-CoV. Recent developments in the field of herbal medicine have drawn attention to the potential efficacy of natural compounds in the management of viral infections, including SARS. Herbal molecules, characterized by their diverse bioactive constituents, exhibit antiviral properties that could be harnessed to mitigate SARS symptoms and inhibit viral replication. Ocimum sanctum, Tinospora cordifolia, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Panax ginseng, and Aloe vera have been identified for their immunomodulatory effects. This review highlights promising herbal molecules such as quercetin, and curcumin, which have demonstrated antiviral effects in–vitro and in some preclinical studies. While current treatment strategies for SARS primarily rely on supportive care and antiviral medications, the exploration of herbal molecules presents an exciting avenue for potential adjunctive therapies. Further research is required to validate their efficacy, safety profiles, and mechanisms of action. A holistic approach that combines conventional medicine with herbal remedies may offer new insights into the treatment of SARS and other viral respiratory illnesses.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) persist in many patients for weeks and months after recovery from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent evidence suggests that pathological changes in skeletal muscle may contribute significantly to ongoing pain and fatigue, particularly post-exertional malaise. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PASC-related fatigue by examining skeletal muscle function and circulating factors in affected individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of patients with fatigue-associated PASC who had experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and content in PASC participants compared to healthy controls. This lower respiratory capacity was accompanied by markedly elevated circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (sIL2R), a T cell-specific receptor. In vitro experiments demonstrated that sIL2R directly impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces mitochondrial complex III subunit protein levels in cultured muscle cells. These findings suggest a mechanism linking systemic immune dysregulation to muscle-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC. This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of PASC identifying sIL2R as a promising therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial deficits in PASC-related fatigue and opening avenues for developing targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Problem COVID-19 during pregnancy is linked to increased maternal morbidity and a higher incidence of preterm births, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Cellular senescence, characterized by the irreversible cessation of cell division, is a critical process in placental function and its dysregulation has been implicated in pregnancy complications like preterm birth. Senescence can be induced by various stressors, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and viral infections. Method of Study In this study, we determined whether COVID-19 had an impact on placental senescence. We examined placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=10 term, 4 preterm) compared to uninfected controls (n=10 term, 3 preterm). The placentas were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication (Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins), markers of DNA damage (γH2AX) and oxidative stress (ROS), and senescence (telomere length; cell cycle regulators, SASP). Results While no overall differences in cellular senescence markers were observed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups, we found increased secreted SASP markers and confocal microscopy revealed localized areas of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the placentas from COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces localized placental damage, warranting further investigation into its impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes.">

        <tr id="Secretory (S) IgA antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 are induced in saliva and upper respiratory tract (URT) secretions by natural infection and may be critical in determining the outcome of initial infection. Secretory IgA1 (SIgA1) is the predominant isotype of antibodies in these secretions. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is most effectively accomplished by polymeric antibodies such as SIgA. We hypothesize that cleavage of SIgA1 antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by unique bacterial IgA1 proteases to univalent Fabα antibody fragments with diminished virus neutralizing activity would facilitate the descent of the virus into the lungs to cause serious disease and also enhance its airborne transmission to others. Recent studies of the nasopharyngeal microbiota of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have revealed significant increases in the proportions of IgA1 protease-producing bacteria in comparison with healthy subjects. Similar considerations might apply also to other respiratory viral infections including influenza, possibly explaining the original attribution of influenza to Haemophilus influenzae, which produces IgA1 protease.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and establish a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12 days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the homeostatic and preactivated microglia population decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis, particularly affecting the elderly, who are more susceptible to severe outcomes. However, definitive parameters or mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in elderly people remain confused. Thus, this study seeks to elucidate the mechanism behind the increased vulnerability of elderly individuals to severe COVID-19. We employed an aged mouse model with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain to mimic the severe symptoms observed in elderly patients with COVID-19. Comprehensive analyses of the whole lung were performed using transcriptome and proteome sequencing, comparing data from aged and young mice. For transcriptome analysis, bulk RNA sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry following protein extraction, digestion, and peptide labeling. We analyzed the transcriptome and proteome profiles of young and aged mice and discovered that aged mice exhibited elevated baseline levels of inflammation and tissue damage repair. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, aged mice showed increased antiviral and inflammatory responses; however, these responses were weaker than those in young mice, with significant complement and coagulation cascade responses. In summary, our study demonstrates that the increased vulnerability of the elderly to severe COVID-19 can be attributed to an attenuated antiviral response and the overactivation of complement and coagulation cascades.">

        <tr id="Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR1 has been implicated in maintaining self-tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and mediating antiviral immunity. Foreign viral double-stranded RNA triggers rapid interferon response and activates ADAR1 in the host immune system. Emerging data points to a role of ADAR1 A-to-I editing in the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19 disease. We identify A-to-I editing events within human whole transcriptome data from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, non-infected individuals, and individuals with other viral illnesses from nasopharyngeal swabs. High levels of RNA editing in host cells are associated with low SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p = 9.27 E-06), suggesting an inhibitory effect of ADAR1 on viral infection. Additionally, we find differentially expressed genes associated with RNA-modifications and interferon response. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected nasopharyngeal swabs reveals that cytotoxic CD8 T cells upregulate ADAR1 in COVID-19 positive samples (p = 0.0269). We further reveal ADAR1 expression increases with CD4 and CD8 T cell activation, and knockdown of ADAR1 leads to apoptosis and aberrant IL-2 secretion. Together, our data suggests A-to-I RNA editing is required to maintain healthy homeostasis of activated T cells to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. Many expect future coronavirus introductions into the human population. Hence, it is essential to understand the basic biology of these viruses. In natural infection, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein is co-expressed with all other viral proteins, which modify cellular compartments to maximize virion assembly. By comparison, most of S is degraded when the protein is expressed in isolation, as in current molecular vaccines. To probe the maturation pathway of S, we redirected its maturation by fusing S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. CD81 is a defining constituent of extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes. EVs are generated in large numbers by all cells, extruded into blood and lymph, and transfer cargo between cells and systemically (estimated 1012 EVs per mL plasma). EVs, like platelets, can be transfused between unrelated donors. When fusing the proline-stabilized form of strain Delta S into the flexible, large extracellular loop of CD81 rather than being degraded in the lysosome, S was extruded into EVs. CD81-S fusion containing EVs were produced in large numbers and could be isolated to high purity. Purified CD81::S EVs bound ACE2, and S displayed on individual EV was observed by cryogenic electron microscopy (EM). The CD81::S-fusion EVs were non-toxic and elicited an anti-S trimer and anti-RBD antibody response in mice. This report shows a design path to maximize viral glycoprotein assembly and release without relying on the co-expression of potentially pathogenic nonstructural viral proteins. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. To understand the maturation pathway of S, we fused S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. The resulting molecule is secreted in extracellular vesicles and induces antibodies in mice. This may be a general design path for viral glycoprotein vaccines.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a significant public health threat, particularly in children and older adults, with high mortality rates. Some of these pathogens are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza viruses (IV), human parvovirus B19 (B19V), and human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1). These viruses cause various respiratory symptoms, including cough, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Notably, these viruses can also impact the central nervous system (CNS), leading to acute manifestations such as seizures, encephalopathies, encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and long-term complications. The precise mechanisms by which these viruses affect the CNS are not fully understood. Glial cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes within the CNS, play pivotal roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and regulating immune responses. Exploring how these cells interact with viral pathogens, such as hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IVs, B19V, and HBoV1, offers crucial insights into the significant impact of respiratory viruses on the CNS. This review article examines hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IV, B19V, and HBoV1 interactions with microglia and astrocytes, shedding light on potential neurological consequences.">

        <tr id="The primary challenge posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is COVID-19-related mortality, often exacerbated by additional medical complications, such as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Up to half of COVID-19 patients experience kidney complications, with those facing acute respiratory failure and kidney injury having the worst overall prognosis. Despite the significant impact of CAKI on COVID-19-related mortality and its enduring effects in long COVID, the underlying causes and molecular mechanisms of CAKI remain elusive. In this study, we identified a functional relationship between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein and inflammation-driven apoptotic death of renal tubular epithelial cells in patients with CAKI. We demonstrate in vitro that ORF3a independently induces renal cell-specific apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by the elevation of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and the activation of NF-kB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine (TNFα and IL-6) production. By examining kidney tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-ACE2 transgenic mice, we observed a similar correlation between ORF3a-induced cytopathic changes and kidney injury. This correlation was further validated through reconstitution of the ORF3a effects via direct adenoviral injection into mouse kidneys. Through medicinal analysis, we identified a natural compound, glycyrrhizin (GL4419), which not only blocks viral replication in renal cells, but also mitigates ORF3a-induced renal cell death by inhibiting activation of a high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, leading to a reduction of KIM-1. Moreover, ORF3a interacts with HMGB1. Overproduction or downregulation of hmgb1 expression results in correlative changes in renal cellular KIM-1 response and respective cytokine production, implicating a crucial role of HMGB1 in ORF3a-inflicted kidney injuries. Our data suggest a direct functional link between ORF3a and kidney injury, highlighting ORF3a as a unique therapeutic target contributing to CAKI.


IMPORTANCE
The major challenge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the pandemic is COVID-19-related mortality, which has tragically claimed millions of lives. COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality are often exacerbated by pre-existing medical conditions, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), or the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to COVID-19, collectively known as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Patients who experience acute respiratory failure with CAKI have the poorest clinical outcomes, including increased mortality. Despite these alarming clinical findings, there is a critical gap in our understanding of the underlying causes of CAKI. Our study establishes a direct correlation between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral ORF3a protein and kidney injury induced by ORF3a linking to CAKI. This functional relationship was initially observed in our clinical studies of COVID-19 patients with AKI and was further validated through animal and in vitro cellular studies, either by expressing ORF3a alone or in the context of viral infection. By elucidating this functional relationship and its underlying mechanistic pathways, our research deepens the understanding of COVID-19-associated kidney diseases and presents potential therapeutic avenues to address the healthcare challenges faced by individuals with underlying conditions.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the generation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector and memory T cells. However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="From the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, an excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL6, was detected in serum from patients. As a consequence, several anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Dexamethasone (a strong corticoid), were used to counteract such cytokine storm occurring during severe disease. By contrast, pro-inflammatory interleukin 11 (IL11), a member of the IL6 family, was detected in respiratory tissues from infected patients and in experimental epithelial cellular models. In this work, human A549 lung epithelial cells were individually transduced with SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORFs), resulting in a IL11 increase, which was significantly decreased after Dexamethasone treatment. The use of this cellular platform allowed us to screen for new possible anti-inflammatory compounds from Fasciola hepatica. Our results highlighted the ability of FhNEJ (Fasciola hepatica newly excysted juvenile flukes) somatic extract to decrease IL11 levels in ORF-transduced cells. These results emphasized the role of IL11 in lung epithelial inflammation, making it a potential target for future treatments of lung inflammation which occurs in COVID-19, and validate the use of these ORF-expressing cells as a cellular platform to test anti-inflammatory compounds for COVID-19 disease.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. 350,000 cases are reported annually in the U.S., although that number is expected to increase as climate change expands fungal geographic range. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the symptomatic 40% are often misdiagnosed due to similarities with bronchitis or pneumonia. A small subset of infection progress to severe illness, necessitating a better understanding of immune responses during lethal infection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we characterized lung responses during Coccidioides infection. We identified monocyte-derived Spp1-expressing macrophages as potential mediators of tissue remodeling and fibrosis, marked by high expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory transcripts. These macrophages showed elevated TGF-β and IL-6 signaling, pathways involved in fibrosis pathogenesis. Additionally, we observed significant neutrophil infiltration and defective lymphocyte responses, indicating severe adaptive immunity dysregulation in lethal, acute infection. These findings enhance our understanding of Coccidioides infection and suggest new therapeutic targets. Importance: Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, which is prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. With climate change potentially expanding the geographic range of this fungus, understanding the immune responses during severe infections is crucial. Our study used advanced techniques to analyze lung responses during Coccidioides infection, identifying specific immune cells that may contribute to tissue damage and fibrosis. These findings provide new insights into the disease mechanisms and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention, which could improve outcomes for patients suffering from severe Valley Fever.">

        <tr id="Waning immunity and the emergence of immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants jeopardize vaccine efficacy leading to breakthrough infections. We have previously shown that innate immune cells play a critical role in controlling SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the innate immune response during breakthrough infections, we modeled breakthrough infections by challenging low-dose vaccinated mice with a vaccine-mismatched SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. We found that low-dose vaccinated infected mice had a 2-log reduction in lung viral burden, but increased immune cell infiltration in the lung parenchyma, characterized by monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and eosinophils. Single cell RNA-seq revealed viral RNA was highly associated with eosinophils that corresponded to a unique IFN-γ biased signature. Antibody-mediated depletion of eosinophils in vaccinated mice resulted in increased virus replication and dissemination in the lungs, demonstrating that eosinophils in the lungs are protective during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. These results highlight the critical role for the innate immune response in vaccine mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant exhibits high transmissibility with a strong immune escape ability and causes frequent large-scale global infections by producing predominant subvariants. Here, using human upper/lower airway and intestinal cells, we examined the previously dominant BA.1–BA.5 and BA.2.75 subvariants, together with the recently emerged XBB/BQ lineages, in comparison to the former Delta variant. We observed a tendency for each virus to demonstrate higher growth capability than the previously dominant subvariants. Unlike human bronchial and intestinal cells, nasal epithelial cells accommodated the efficient entry of certain Omicron subvariants, similar to the Delta variant. In contrast to the Delta’s reliance on cell-surface transmembrane protease serine 2, all tested Omicron variants depended on endosomal cathepsin L. Moreover, S1/S2 cleavage of early Omicron spikes was less efficient, whereas recent viruses exhibit improved cleavage efficacy. Our results show that the Omicron variant progressively adapts to human cells through continuous endosome-mediated host cell entry. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, has evolved into a number of variants/subvariants, which have generated multiple global waves of infection. In order to monitor/predict virological features of emerging variants and determine appropriate strategies for anti-viral development, understanding conserved or altered features of evolving SARS-CoV-2 is important. In this study, we addressed previously or recently predominant Omicron subvariants and demonstrated the gradual adaptation to human cells. The host cell entry route, which was altered from the former Delta variant, was conserved among all tested Omicron subvariants. Collectively, this study revealed both changing and maintained features of SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron variant evolution.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 remains a significant threat to public health globally. Infection in some susceptible individuals causes life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI/ARDS) and/or death. Human surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a C-type lectin expressed in the lung and other mucosal tissues, and it plays a critical role in host defense against various pathogens. The human SP-A genes (SFTPA1 and SFTPA2) are highly polymorphic and comprise several common genetic variants, i.e., SP-A1 (variants 6A2, 6A4) and SP-A2 (variants 1A0, 1A3). Here, we elucidated the differential antiviral and immunoregulatory roles of SP-A variants in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Six genetically-modified mouse lines, expressing both hACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and individual SP-A variants: (hACE2/6A2 (6A2), hACE2/6A4 (6A4), hACE2/1A0 (1A0), and hACE2/1A3(1A3), one SP-A knockout (hACE2/SP-A KO (KO) and one hACE2/mouse SP-A (K18) mice, were challenged intranasally with 103 PFU SARS-CoV-2 or saline (Sham). Infected KO and 1A0 mice had more weight loss and mortality compared to other mouse lines. Relative to other infected mouse lines, a more severe ALI was observed in KO, 1A0, and 6A2 mice. Reduced viral titers were generally observed in the lungs of infected SP-A mice relative to KO mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an upregulation in genes that play central roles in immune responses such as MyD88, Stat3, IL-18, and Jak2 in the lungs of KO and 1A0 mice. However, Mapk1 was significantly downregulated in 6A2 versus 1A0 mice. Analysis of biological pathways identified those involved in lung host defense and innate immunity, including pathogen-induced cytokine, NOD1/2, and Trem1 signaling pathways. Consistent with the transcriptomic data, levels of cytokines and chemokines such as G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-1β were comparatively higher in the lungs and sera of KO and 1A0 mice with the highest mortality rate. These findings demonstrate that human SP-A variants differentially modulate SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and disease severity by differentially inhibiting viral infectivity and regulating immune-related gene expressions.">

        <tr id="Infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease with very heterogeneous symptoms. Dyslipidaemia is prevalent in at least 20% of Europeans, and dyslipidaemia before SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk for severe COVID-19 and mortality by 139%. Many reports described reduced serum cholesterol levels in virus-infected patients, in particular in those with severe disease. The liver is the major organ for lipid homeostasis and hepatic dysfunction appears to occur in one in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 disease severity and liver injury may be related to impaired cholesterol homeostasis. These observations prompted efforts to assess the therapeutic opportunities of cholesterol-lowering medications to reduce COVID-19 severity. The majority of studies implicate statins to have beneficial effects on disease severity and outcome in COVID-19. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibodies have also shown potential to protect against COVID-19. This review describes the relationship between systemic cholesterol levels, liver injury and COVID-19 disease severity. The potential effects of statins and PCSK9 in COVID-19 are summarised. Finally, the relationship between cholesterol and lung function, the first organ to be affected by SARS-CoV-2, is described.">

        <tr id="Introduction Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a global respiratory disease, which annually leads to 3-5 million cases of severe illness, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths. Additionally, during the past century, four global IAV pandemics have claimed millions of human lives. The epithelial lining of the trachea plays a vital role during IAV infection, both as point of viral entry and replication as well as in the antiviral immune response. Tracheal tissue is generally inaccessible from human patients, which makes animal models crucial for the study of the tracheal host immune response. Method In this study, pigs were inoculated with swine- or human-adapted H1N1 IAV to gain insight into how host adaptation of IAV shapes the innate immune response during infection. In-depth multi-omics analysis (global proteomics and RNA sequencing) of the host response in upper and lower tracheal tissue was conducted, and results were validated by microfluidic qPCR. Additionally, a subset of samples was selected for histopathological examination. Results A classical innate antiviral immune response was induced in both upper and lower trachea after infection with either swine- or human-adapted IAV with upregulation of genes and higher abundance of proteins associated with viral infection and recognition, accompanied by a significant induction of interferon stimulated genes with corresponding higher proteins concentrations. Infection with the swine-adapted virus induced a much stronger immune response compared to infection with a human-adapted IAV strain in the lower trachea, which could be a consequence of a higher viral load and a higher degree of inflammation. Discussion Central components of the JAK-STAT pathway, apoptosis, pyrimidine metabolism, and the cytoskeleton were significantly altered depending on infection with swine- or human-adapted virus and might be relevant mechanisms in relation to antiviral immunity against putative zoonotic IAV. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that during host adaptation, IAV evolve to modulate important host cell elements to favor viral infectivity and replication.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 lineage emerged in late 2023 and quickly replaced the XBB lineages, becoming the predominant Omicron variant worldwide in 2024. We estimate the epidemiological impact of this SARS-CoV-2 lineage replacement in Brazil and we further assessed the cross-reactive neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in a cohort of convalescent Brazilian patients infected during 2023. We analyzed the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in Brazil between July 2023 and March 2024. We evaluated the cross-reactive NAb responses to the JN.1 variant in a cohort of convalescent Brazilian patients, both before and after infection with XBB.1* lineages. JN.1 replaced XBB with similar temporal dynamics across all country regions, though its epidemiological impact varied between locations. The Southeastern, Southern, and Central-Western regions experienced a brief XBB wave around October 2023, shortly before the introduction of JN.1, without any immediate upsurge of SARI cases during viral lineage replacement. By contrast, the Northeastern and Northern regions did not experience an XBB wave in the latter half of 2023 and displayed a rapid surge in SARI cases driven by the emergence of the JN.1. We found that recent XBB infections in the Brazilian population significantly boosted cross-reactive NAb levels against JN.1. The XBB wave observed in the second half of 2023 in some Brazilian states likely acted as a booster for population immunity, providing short-term protection against JN.1 infections and delaying the rise of SARI cases in certain regions of the country.">

        <tr id="Although vaccines have reduced the burden of COVID-19, their efficacy in helminth infection–endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal roundworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in mice. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA-vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared with animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth-mediated suppression of spike protein–specific CD8+ T cell responses occurred independently of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling, whereas blockade of interleukin-10 (IL-10) rescued vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses. Together, these data show that, in mice, intestinal helminth infection impaired vaccine-induced T cell responses through an IL-10 pathway, which compromised protection against antigenically drifted SARS-CoV-2 variants. Intestinal helminth infection blunts T cell responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in mice. Editor’s summary Much of the global population lives in areas endemic to helminths, which are known to affect responses to vaccines. To discern how helminth infection affects responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, Desai et al. infected mice with the hookworm Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) during the course of a primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series. The authors found that Hpb infection compromised T cell, but not antibody, responses to SARS-CoV-2 in an IL-10–dependent manner. Although Hpb-infected K18-hACE2 mice were protected from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 challenge through their antibody responses, they were more susceptible to challenge with an Omicron variant, which can evade antibodies but is still susceptible to T cell responses. Together, these data highlight the need to keep helminth infections in mind during vaccine development and deployment. —Courtney Malo">

The production of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are physiologically involved in cell communication, is also altered during COVID-19, along with the dysfunction of cytoplasmic organelles. Since circulating EVs reflect the state of their cells of origin, they represent valuable tools for monitoring pathological conditions. Despite challenges in detecting EVs due to their size and specific cellular compartment origin using different methodologies, flow cytometry has proven to be an effective method for assessing the role of EVs in COVID-19. This review summarizes the involvement of plasmatic EVs in COVID-19 patients and individuals with Long COVID (LC) affected by post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), highlighting their dual role in exerting both pro- and antiviral effects. We also emphasize how flow cytometry, with its multiparametric approach, can be employed to characterize circulating EVs, particularly in infectious diseases such as COVID-19, and suggest their potential role in chronic impairments during post-infection.">

COVID-19 has taught us that the development of vaccines, repurposing of drugs, and understanding the mechanism of a disease can be done within a short time. The COVID-19 proteomics and metabolomics has contributed to its diagnosis, understanding of its progression, host-virus interaction, disease mechanism, and also in the search of suitable anti-COVID therapeutics. Mass spectrometry based proteomics was used to find the potential biomarkers of different stages of COVID-19 including severe and nonsevere cases in the blood serum. Notably, protein-protein interaction techniques to understand host-virus interactions were also significantly useful. The single-cell proteomics studies were carried out to ascertain the changes in immune cell composition and its activation in mild COVID-19 patients versus severe COVID-19 patients using whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Modern technologies were helpful to deal with the pandemic; however, there is still scope for further development. Further, attempts were made to understand the protein-protein, metabolite-metabolite, and protein-metabolite interactomes, derived from proteins and metabolite fingerprints of COVID-19 patients by reanalysis of COVID-19 public mass spectrometry based proteomics and metabolomics studies. Further, some of these interactions were supported by the literature as validations in the COVID-19 studies.">

This review article explores the causality relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection, and protein misfolding, leading to amyloid-related conditions. It delves into the mechanisms by which viral proteins may accelerate amyloid formation, exacerbating post-infection complications, including neurological sequelae. Drawing from interdisciplinary research and clinical observations, the potential links between COVID-19, vaccination, and amyloidosis, emphasize the importance of understanding the longterm effect of post-COVID symptoms. This review examines the potential role of COVID-19-related proteins in the formation of amyloid in other related proteins of amyloidosis.">

        <tr id="Some respiratory viruses, such as Human Rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68), share the feature of hijacking host lipids in order to generate specialised replication organelles (ROs) with unique lipid compositions to enable viral replication. We have recently uncovered a novel non-canonical function of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, as a critical factor in the formation of ROs in response to HRV infection. The STING pathway is the main DNA virus sensing system of the innate immune system controlling the type I IFN machinery. Although it is well-characterised as part of the DNA sensor machinery, the STING function in RNA viral infections is largely unexplored. In the current study, we investigated whether other RO-forming RNA viruses, such as EV-D68 and SARS-CoV-2, can also utilise STING for their replication. Using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, we demonstrate that STING is hijacked by these viruses and is utilised as part of the viral replication machinery. STING also co-localises with glycolytic enzymes needed to fuel the energy for replication. The inhibition of STING leads to the modulation of glucose metabolism in EV-D68-infected cells, suggesting that it might also manipulate immunometabolism. Therefore, for RO-generating RNA viruses, STING seems to have non-canonical functions in membrane lipid re-modelling, and the formation of replication vesicles, as well as immunometabolism.">

        <tr id="Purpose. A virus, when it infects a host organism, multiplies its ribonucleic acid (RNA) to make it more harmful. We analyze if a view-based temporal template method, the motion history image (MHI) algorithm, may be of use to extract information on the progression of viral interactions over time. Methods. We employ an alternative online processing modality to comprehend and analyze the replication dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). The data are evaluated using the computation of a quantitative algorithm, the absolute value of differences (AVD), followed by the generation of temporal template map, the MHI of viral contact. Results. We show that the MHI identifies various stages to examine cultural characteristics and information on the progression of viral interactions over time. The results are more easily obtained compared to a visual inspection of the frames constituting the recordings. MHI also has the advantage of relying on a simple algorithm. The AVD index further provides deeper insights into the dynamics of the viral interaction over time, and its measurement suggests that SARS CoV-2 virus is becoming more widespread. This study shows that the replication process damages the host cell over time, in addition to causing SARS CoV-2 to proliferate. Conclusions. The MHI provides a framework for automated feature extraction from time series data. The combined approach results in decreased computational complexity and enables online assessment of the assay. Clinical and research studies can be conducted to evaluate MHI and AVD and their utility in aiding diagnostic analysis.">

        <tr id="In EAE, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, immunization with MOG autoantigen results in the generation of Th1/Th17 T cells in the periphery. MOG-specific T cells then invade into the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neuronal demyelination. Microglia, innate immune cells in the CNS are known to regulate various neuronal diseases. However, the role of microglia in EAE has remained elusive. BRD4 is a BET protein expressed in microglia, whether BRD4 in microglia contributes to EAE has not been determined. We show that EAE pathology was markedly reduced with microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout (cKO). In these mice, microglia- T cell interactions were greatly reduced, leading to the lack of T cell reactivation. Microglia specific transcriptome data showed downregulation of genes required for interaction with and reactivation of T cells in Brd4 cKO samples. In summary, BRD4 plays a critical role in regulating microglia function in normal and EAE CNS. Summary This study demonstrates that in a EAE model, microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout mice were defective in expressing genes required for microglia- T cells interaction and those involved in neuroinflammation, and demyelination resulting in fewer CNS T cell invasion and display marked reduction in EAE pathology.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 include several comorbidities, but age was the most striking one since elderly people were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the reasons for this markedly unfavorable response in the elderly, immunosenescence and inflammaging appear as major drivers of this outcome. A finding that was also notable was that hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 have an accumulation of senescent T cells, suggesting that immunosenescence may be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present work was designed to examine whether these immunosenescence changes are characteristic of COVID-19 and whether it is dependent on disease severity using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our cross-sectional data show that COVID-19, but not other respiratory infections, rapidly increased cellular senescence and exhaustion in CD4 and CD8 T cells during early infection. In addition, longitudinal analyses with patients from Brazil and Portugal provided evidence of increased frequencies of senescent and exhausted T cells over a 7-d period in patients with mild/moderate and severe COVID-19. Altogether, the study suggests that accelerated immunosenescence in CD4 and especially CD8 T-cell compartments may represent a common and unique outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection.">

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: In this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n=204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Results: Plasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants harboring mutations in the structural protein, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, have raised concern about potential immune escape. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in infection and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies. The mutations that occur in the structural proteins, especially in the spike protein, lead to changes in the virus attributes of transmissibility, an increase in disease severity, a notable reduction in neutralizing antibodies generated and thus a decreased response to vaccines and therapy. The observed multiple mutations in the RBD of the spike protein showed immune escape because it increases the affinity of spike protein binding with the ACE-2 receptor of host cells and increases resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections from the infected tissues and clearing them from circulation. Cytotoxic T cells efficiently recognized the infected cells and killed them by releasing soluble mediator's perforin and granzymes. However, the overwhelming response of T cells and, subsequently, the overproduction of inflammatory mediators during severe infections with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to poor outcomes. This review article summarizes the impact of mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations of RBD, on immunogenicity, immune escape and vaccine-induced immunity, which could contribute to future studies focusing on vaccine design and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019, a diversity of viral genomic variants has emerged and spread globally due to increased transmissibility, pathogenicity, and immune evasion. By the first trimester of 2023 in Chile, as in most countries, BQ and XBB were the predominant circulating sub-lineages of Omicron. The molecular and antigenic characteristics of these variants have been mainly determined using non-authentic spike pseudoviruses, which is often described as a limitation. Additionally, few comparative studies using isolates from recent Omicron sub-lineages have been conducted. In this study, we isolated SARS-CoV-2 variants from clinical samples, including the ancestral B.1.1, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and sub-lineages of BA.2 and BA.5. We assessed their infectivity through cell culture infections and their antibody evasion using neutralization assays. We observed variations in viral plaque size, cell morphology, and cytotoxicity upon infection in Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells for each variant compared to the ancestral B.1.1 virus. BA.2-derived sub-variants, such as XBB.1.5, showed attenuated viral replication, while BA.5-derived variants, such as BQ.1.1, exhibited replication rates similar to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus. Similar trends were observed in intestinal Caco-2 cells, except for Delta. Antibody neutralization experiments using sera from individuals infected during the first COVID-19 wave (FWI) showed a consistent but moderate reduction in neutralization against Omicron sub-lineages. Interestingly, despite being less prevalent, BQ.1.1 showed a 6.1-fold greater escape from neutralization than XBB.1.5. Neutralization patterns were similar when tested against sera from individuals vaccinated with 3xBNT162b2 (PPP) or Coronavac-Coronavac-BNT162b2 (CCP) schedules. However, CCP sera showed 2.3-fold higher neutralization against XBB.1.5 than FWI and PPP sera. This study provides new insights into the differences between BA.2 and BA.5-derived variants, leading to their eventual outcompetition. Our analysis offers important evidence regarding the balance between infectivity and antigenic escape that drives the evolution of second-generation SARS-CoV-2 variants in the population.">

        <tr id="Over the past four years, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious global health challenges. The severe form of disease and death resulted from the failure of immune regulatory mechanisms, closely highlighted by the dual proinflammatory cytokine and soluble immune checkpoint (sICP) storm. Identifying the individual factors impacting on disease severity, evolution and outcome, as well as any additional interconnections, have become of high scientific interest.In this study, we evaluated a novel panel composed of ten sICPs for the predictive values of COVID-19 disease severity, mortality and Delta vs. Omicron variant infections in relation to hyperinflammatory biomarkers. The serum levels of sICPs from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital admission were determined by Luminex, and artificial neural network analysis was applied for defining the distinct patterns of molecular associations with each form of disease: mild, moderate, and severe.Notably, distinct sICP profiles characterized various stages of disease and Delta infections: while sCD40 played a central role in all defined diagrams, the differences emerged from the distribution levels of four molecules recently found and relatively less investigated (sCD30, s4-1BB, sTIM-1, sB7-H3), and their associations with various hematological and biochemical inflammatory biomarkers. The artificial neural network analysis revealed the prominent role of serum sTIM-1 and Galectin-9 levels at hospital admission in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors, as well as the role of specific anti-interleukin therapy (Tocilizumab, Anakinra) in improving survival for patients with initially high sTIM-1 levels. Furthermore, strong associations between sCD40 and Galectin-9 with suPAR defined the Omicron variant infections, while the positive match of sCD40 with sTREM-1 serum levels characterized the Delta-infected patients.Of importance, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of circulatory immune factors governing the COVID-19 pathology, and identifies key roles of sCD40, sTIM-1, and Galectin-9 in predicting mortality.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune dysregulation and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia have been implicated in fatal COVID-19 disease. However, how these two factors interact to shape disease outcomes is unclear.


METHODS
We carried out viral and immunological phenotyping on a prospective cohort of 280 patients with COVID-19 presenting to acute care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts and Genoa, Italy between June 1, 2020 and February 8, 2022. Disease severity, mortality, plasma viremia, and immune dysregulation were assessed. A mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection was used to analyze the therapeutic potential of Notch4 and pyroptosis inhibition in disease outcome.


RESULTS
Stratifying patients based on %Notch4+ Treg cells and/or the presence of plasma viremia identified four subgroups with different clinical trajectories and immune phenotypes. Patients with both high %Notch4+ Treg cells and viremia suffered the most disease severity and 90-day mortality compared to the other groups even after adjusting for baseline comorbidities. Increased Notch4 and plasma viremia impacted different arms of the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased Notch4 was associated with decreased Treg cell amphiregulin expression and suppressive function whereas plasma viremia was associated with increased monocyte cell pyroptosis. Combinatorial therapies using Notch4 blockade and pyroptosis inhibition induced stepwise protection against mortality in a mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection.


CONCLUSIONS
The clinical trajectory and survival outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is predicated on two cardinal factors in disease pathogenesis: viremia and Notch4+ Treg cells. Intervention strategies aimed at resetting the immune dysregulation in COVID-19 by antagonizing Notch4 and pyroptosis may be effective in severe cases of viral lung infection.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has caused global morbidity and high mortality worldwide. Today it is known that, despite recovery from COVID-19, confirmed by both laboratory and instrumental diagnostic methods, many patients, regardless of the severity of the disease, suffer from a significant deterioration in health and increased exacerbations of chronic diseases. During examinations by attending physicians, they note fatigue, an increase in cases of acute respiratory viral infections per year, an increase in relapses of skin diseases such as furunculosis, pyoderma, exacerbation of pulmonary pathologies, pathologies of the urinary tract of inflammatory origin, as well as chronic infectious diseases such as herpesvirus and human papillomavirus infections, which occur for the first time or are characterized by frequent relapses no less than six months after recovery from acute COVID-19. Such persistent post-infectious consequences are known as post-COVID syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by damage to both the acquired and innate immune systems. In previous work, we determined the role of B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and the regulatory properties of CD46, as well as its involvement in the processes of viral entry into the cell. In this study, we studied the relationship of immune disorders of these factors of innate and acquired immunity with the clinical manifestations of post-COVID infectious syndrome in this category of patients and the severity of lung damage in these patients during the acute period of COVID-19. The results of the study showed that in some patients more than six months after suffering from COVID-19, the following was revealed: in patients who had a coronavirus infection without lung damage, no violations of the innate and acquired parts of the immune system were detected. In addition, significant differences were identified between clinical manifestations of diseases with increasing cases of relapses or newly identified after clinical recovery from an acute COVID-19 infection, depending on the phenotype of immune status disorders.">

Employing advanced high-throughput technologies, this interdisciplinary approach reveals the complex immunological interactions among these systems, enhancing our understanding of immune responses and yielding vital insights into the mechanisms that influence viral spread and host susceptibility. Significant advancements in immunomics have accelerated vaccine development, improved viral mutation tracking, and broadened our comprehension of immune pathways in zoonotic transmissions. This review highlights the role of animals, not merely as carriers or reservoirs, but as essential elements of ecological networks that profoundly influence viral epidemiology. Furthermore, we explore how environmental factors shape immune response patterns across species, influencing viral persistence and spillover risks. Moreover, case studies demonstrating the integration of immunogenomic data within the One Health framework for COVID-19 are discussed, outlining its implications for future research. However, linking humans, animals, and the environment through immunogenomics remains challenging, including the complex management of vast amounts of data and issues of scalability. Despite challenges, integrating immunomics data within the One Health framework significantly enhances our strategies and responses to zoonotic diseases and pandemic threats, marking a crucial direction for future public health breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Millions have been infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since its emergence in 2019, but most patients make a full recovery. The long-term consequences of the infection are anticipated to unravel in the succeeding years with reports of patients experiencing chronic, debilitating sequelae post-infection commonly referred to as Long COVID. Various Variants of Concern (VoCs) have emerged as the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolved displaying increased infectivity and immune evasiveness. We investigate whether the infecting VoCs affect the sequelae of Long COVID in a Philippine cohort.SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed using RT-PCR followed by Next Generation Sequencing were identified from selected regions of the Philippines and recruited through a retrospective-prospective cohort design. Participants were divided based on the initial infecting VoC or Variant of Interest (VoI) and were subsequently interviewed regarding the presence, intensity, and frequency of key Long COVID symptoms, and followed up on two more separate sessions at least three (3) months apart for a total of three (3) data collection points (S1, S2, S3) to document changes in symptoms throughout the year-long study period.Long COVID symptoms were reported in 88, 82, and 68% of participants in S1, S2, and S3, respectively, showing declining incidence with elapsed time since the first reported infection. General symptoms including headache, fatigue, and post-exertional malaise were the most frequently reported symptoms, while neuropsychiatric symptoms were the second most frequently reported symptoms. In all three (3) sessions, intermittent brain fog, fatigue, and headache were the most frequently reported symptoms in all SARS-CoV-2 variant cohorts. Factors such as age, sex, comorbidities, and disease severity influenced symptom frequency, providing insight into the risk factors that contribute to the prevalence of this disease.A large proportion (>68%) of cases in this Philippine cohort previously infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants presented with long-term complications of COVID-19 characterized by a highly heterogeneous set of debilitating symptoms. The study highlights the need for long-term monitoring of Long COVID and its impact on human health and the need for our health systems to adopt policy response strategies.">

These crises include diseases like respiratory syndrome with extreme acuteness i.e. SARS-CoV, and Coronavirus respiratory syndrome in the Middle East i.e. MERS*CoV, and the most recent 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). to ascertain whether the pandemic SARS*CoV-2 is spreading quickly, which is thought to have been brought on by COVID-19, is sexually transmitted. The coronavirus 2 that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome enters cells via the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and Angiotensine-Converting-Enzyme-2 as well as Transmembrane-Serine-Protease-2 (TMPRSS2). Clinical research demonstrates that the COVID-19 action of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the high Enzyme-2 which convert angiotensin expression of the male reproductive system make them unsafe for male reproductive health. Even a few samples from male coronavirus patients demonstrate the effects, such as decreased spermatogenesis. Recent findings of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in sperm, sexual transmission, and the security of prolificacy therapies during the epidemic have renewed debate over potential male reproductive system infections, SARS-CoV-2 shedding into sperm, and sexual transmission. Regarding its presence in the testis or the semen, nevertheless, findings are dubious. This review paper was created with the intention of evaluating the research on (i) the impact of already identified coronaviruses detected in humans on male infertility, (ii) factors associated with male infertility, and (iii) The SARS-CoV-2 effect's mechanism.">

        <tr id="Public health systems reported low mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in East Asia, in low-income countries, and for children during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These reports led commentators to suggest that cross-reactive immunity from prior exposure to other pathogens reduced fatality risk. Resolution of initial infection waves also contributed to speculation that herd immunity prevented further waves prior to vaccination. Serology instead implied that immunity was too limited to achieve herd immunity and that there was little impact from cross-reactive protection. Paediatric deaths exceeded those from influenza, with higher age-specific fatality risk in lower-income nations and similar fatality risk in East Asia compared with demographically similar regions. Neither pre-outbreak exposure to related pathogens nor immunity induced by initial infection waves are necessarily a reliable response to future pathogen outbreaks. Preparedness for future pathogen outbreaks should instead focus on strategies such as voluntary behavioural changes, nonpharmaceutical interventions, and vaccination.">

        <tr id="We previously demonstrated that the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients were filled with a clear hydrogel consisting of hyaluronan (HA). In this translational study, we investigated the role of HA at all stages of COVID-19 disease to map the consequences of elevated HA on morbidity and identify the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced HA production. A reduced alveolar surface area was observed in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, as visualized by a 3D rendering of lung morphology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. We confirmed the presence of HA in lung biopsies and found large quantities of proinflammatory fragmented HA. The association of systemic HA in blood plasma and disease severity was assessed in patients with mild (WHO Clinical Progression Scale, WHO-CPS, 1-5) and severe COVID-19 (WHO-CPS, 6-9) during the acute and convalescent phases and related to lung function. We found that systemic levels of HA were high during acute COVID-19 disease, remained elevated during convalescence, and were associated with a reduced diffusion capacity. In vitro 3D-lung models, differentiated from primary human bronchial epithelial cells, were used to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HA metabolism, and transcriptomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of HA synthases and hyaluronidases, both contributing to increased HA in apical secretions. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment reduced the inflammation and downregulated HA synthases. Our findings demonstrate that HA plays a role in COVID-19 morbidity and that sustained elevated HA concentrations may contribute to long-term respiratory impairment.IMPORTANCEThis study provides insights into the role of hyaluronan (HA) in the severity and long-term impact of COVID-19 on lung function. Through extensive morphological examination of lung tissues and a multicenter study, we identified that HA levels are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, correlating with a reduced lung diffusion capacity during convalescence. Using a 3D-lung model, we further uncovered how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a dysregulated HA metabolism, leading to increased HA production. Our findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting HA metabolism could offer new therapeutic avenues for managing COVID-19, particularly to prevent long-term lung impairment. Additionally, HA holds potential as a biomarker for predicting disease severity, which could guide personalized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Optic neuritis (ON), one of the clinical manifestations of the human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS), was also reported in patients with COVID-19 infection, highlighting one potential neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2. However, the mechanism of ON in these patients is poorly understood.


EVIDENCE ACQUISITION
Insight may be gained by studying the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), a β-coronavirus that belongs to the same family as SARS-CoV-2.


RESULTS
Mouse hepatitis virus-A59, or its isogenic spike protein recombinant strains, inoculation in mice provides an important experimental model to understand underpinning mechanisms of neuroinflammatory demyelination in association with acute stage optic nerve inflammation and chronic stage optic nerve demyelination concurrent with axonal loss. Spike is a surface protein that mediates viral binding and entry into host cells, as well as cell-cell fusion and viral spread. Studies have implicated spike-mediated mechanisms of virus-induced neuroinflammatory demyelination by comparing naturally occurring demyelinating (DM) and nondemyelinating (NDM) MHV strains.


CONCLUSIONS
Here, we summarize findings in MHV-induced experimental ON and myelitis, using natural DM and NDM strains as well as engineered recombinant strains of MHV to understand the role of spike protein in inducing ON and demyelinating disease pathology. Potential parallels in human coronavirus-mediated ON and demyelination, and insight into potential therapeutic strategies, are discussed.">

        <tr id="The incidence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased dramatically in recent years, affecting millions of people worldwide. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients is respiratory illness. However, the disease can also significantly impact the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. ACE-2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a crucial role in regulating various pathological processes. The interaction of the virus with ACE-2 in the myocardium can lead to direct heart damage. Several mechanisms may contribute to myocardial damage in COVID-19 patients, including systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon-mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response, T-cell-mediated damage, coronary plaque instability, and hypoxia. There has been concern that ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 by upregulating ACE-2 expression. However, it may be advisable to continue medications for patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders. The precise mechanisms of cardiomyocyte injury in COVID-19 are not fully understood, but necroptosis appears to play a significant role. Current treatments for cardiac damage in COVID-19 patients include IL-6 blockers and antiplatelet therapy. Ponatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed using computational and structural approaches, has shown the potential to affect cell death through its impact on tyrosine kinase activity. By reviewing studies related to ponatinib's effects on necroptosis and cell death, we propose a novel approach to potentially reduce the cardiotoxic effects of COVID-19 on cardiomyocytes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac injury in COVID-19 and to develop targeted therapies to protect the heart from the devastating effects of this disease.">

Here, we link heterogenous neutrophil populations to disease severity in COVID-19. We identified neutrophils with features of cellular aging and immunosuppressive capacity in mild COVID-19 and features of neutrophil immaturity and activation in severe disease. The low-density neutrophil (LDN) number in circulating blood correlated with COVID-19 severity. Many of the divergent neutrophil phenotypes in COVID-19 were overrepresented in the LDN fraction and were less detectable in normal-density neutrophils. Functionally, neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 displayed defects in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species production. Soluble factors secreted by neutrophils from these patients inhibited T cell proliferation. Neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 had increased expression of arginase-1 protein, a feature that was retained in convalescent patients. Despite this increase in intracellular expression, there was a reduction in arginase-1 release by neutrophils into serum and culture supernatants. Furthermore, neutrophil-mediated T cell suppression was independent of arginase-1. Our results indicate the presence of dysfunctional, activated, and immature neutrophils in severe COVID-19.">

Given that the activity of neutrophils has not been described in these patients, we aimed to investigate the function of neutrophils at ICU admission and on Day 7 (D7) post admission. Neutrophil maturation and several functional indicators were investigated. We detected a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species production at D7, but we did not observe any other significant alterations in neutrophil function. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage obtained from patients displayed no inhibitory effect on the function of neutrophils from healthy donors. These findings indicate that patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS do not acquire neutrophil dysfunction within the first week of their stay, which suggests that nosocomial infections among these patients are not due to acquired neutrophil dysfunctions.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus caused the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and the prevalence of deaths among men is higher than among women. The epididymis, divided into caput, corpus, and cauda, shows a region-specific immunity. The K18-hACE2 mouse expresses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the receptor that allows SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, studies using this transgenic mouse to evaluate the impact of this viral infection in epididymis have not yet been performed.


OBJECTIVES
We evaluated the expression of hACE2 in the epididymis of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice, and assessed the epididymal immune response, focusing on F4/80+ mononuclear phagocytes and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The following analyses were performed in the epididymal sections of infected mice: epithelial height and duct diameter, birefringent collagen, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labelling, immunoreactions for detection of hACE2, spike, FGF, V-ATPase, F4/80, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and iNOS. Viral particles were identified under electron microscopy. hACE2, Rigi, Tgfb1 and Tnfa expression were also evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS
All epididymal regions expressed hACE2, which increased in all epididymal regions in the infected mice. However, the caput appeared to be the most infected region. Despite this, the caput region showed minimal changes while the cauda showed significant epithelial changes associated with increased iNOS immunoexpression. The F4/80+ mononuclear phagocyte area increased significantly in both stroma and epithelium. In addition to the epithelial and stromal mononuclear phagocytes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha was also detected in clear cells, whose cytoplasm showed a significant increase of this cytokine in the infected animals.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The K18-hACE2 mouse is a useful model for evaluating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the epididymis. The infection induced hACE2 upregulation, favoring the virulence in the epididymis. The epididymal regions responded differentially to infection, and the activation of F4/80+ mononuclear phagocytes associated with the increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha immunolabeling in clear cells indicates a role of clear cells/mononuclear phagocytes immunoregulatory mechanisms in the epididymal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 can not only cause respiratory symptoms but also lead to neurological complications. Research has shown that more than 30% of SARS-CoV-2 patients present neurologic symptoms during COVID-19 (A. Pezzini and A. Padovani, Nat Rev Neurol 16:636-644, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-020-0398-3). Increasing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can invade both the central nervous system (CNS) (M.S. Xydakis, M.W. Albers, E.H. Holbrook, et al. Lancet Neurol 20: 753-761, 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00182-4 ) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (M.N. Soares, M. Eggelbusch, E. Naddaf, et al. J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle 13:11-22, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.12896), resulting in a variety of neurological disorders. This review summarized the CNS complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, including encephalopathy, neurodegenerative diseases, and delirium. Additionally, some PNS disorders such as skeletal muscle damage and inflammation, anosmia, smell or taste impairment, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, ICU-acquired weakness, and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 were described. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological disorders were also discussed, including entering the brain through retrograde neuronal or hematogenous routes, disrupting the normal function of the CNS through cytokine storms, inducing cerebral ischemia or hypoxia, thus leading to neurological complications. Moreover, an overview of long-COVID-19 symptoms is provided, along with some recommendations for care and therapeutic approaches of COVID-19 patients experiencing neurological complications.">

        <tr id="Respiratory fungal infections pose a significant threat to human health. Animal models do not fully recapitulate human disease, necessitating advanced models to study human-fungal pathogen interactions. In this study, we utilized primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) to recapitulate the lung environment in vitro and investigate cellular responses to two diverse, clinically significant fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. To understand the mechanisms of early pathogenesis for both fungi, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of infected hAECs. Analysis revealed that both fungi induced cellular stress and cytokine production. However, the cell subtypes affected and specific pathways differed between fungi, with A. fumigatus and C. posadasii triggering protein-folding-related stress in ciliated cells and hypoxia responses in secretory cells, respectively. This study represents one of the first reports of single-cell transcriptional analysis of hAECs infected with either A. fumigatus or C. posadasii, providing a vital dataset to dissect the mechanism of disease and potentially identify targetable pathways. Importance Fungal infections in the lungs are dreaded complications for those with compromised immune systems and have limited treatment strategies available. These options are restricted further by the increased prevalence of treatment-resistant fungi. Many studies focus on how our immune systems respond to these pathogens, yet airway epithelial cells remain an understudied component of fungal infections in the lungs. Here, the authors provide a transcriptional analysis of primary human airway epithelial cells stimulated by two distinct fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. These data will enable further mechanistic studies of the contribution of the airway epithelium to initial host responses and represent a powerful new resource for investigators.">

        <tr id="The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), often preceded by acute lung injury (ALI), is characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory fluid in the lung alveoli, leaky alveolar epithelium and endothelium, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This progression from ALI to ARDS is a major contributor to the high mortality observed in COVID-19 patients. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to lung ACE2 and, in addition to facilitating viral cell entry, it plays an important role in the development of ALI and ARDS, especially in the later phases of COVID-19 as well as long COVID. Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 4A3 is a key mediator of ARDS pathology. This study tested the hypothesis that targeting PTP4A3 would prevent COVID-19 associated ALI. Intratracheal administration of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Subunit 1 to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 elicited pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leaky alveoli, overexpression of cytokines, structural lung injury and lung dysfunction; all these symptoms were ameliorated by the selective, allosteric inhibitor of PTP4A3, KVX-053. These findings provide the first evidence supporting a role for PTP4A3 in the development of SARS-CoV-2- mediated ALI. Significance Statement This study tested the hypothesis that targeting PTP4A3 would prevent COVID-19 associated ALI/ARDS. Intratracheal administration of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Subunit 1 to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 elicited pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leaky alveoli, overexpression of cytokines and chemokines, structural lung injury and lung dysfunction; all these symptoms were ameliorated by the selective, allosteric inhibitor of PTP4A3, KVX-053. These findings suggest that this novel PTP4A3 inhibitor may be useful against COVID-19 and potentially other viral-induced ARDS.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) remain a significant global cause of infectious disease-related mortality. Accurate discrimination between acute bacterial and viral LRTIs is crucial for optimal patient care, prevention of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, and resource allocation. Plasma samples from LRTI patients with bacterial (n = 36), viral (n = 27; excluding SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV-2 (n = 22), and mixed bacterial–viral (n = 38) etiology were analyzed for protein profiling. Whole-blood RNA samples from a subset of patients (bacterial, n = 8; viral, n = 8; and SARS-CoV-2, n = 8) were analyzed for transcriptional profiling. Lasso regression modeling identified a seven-protein signature (CRP, IL4, IL9, IP10, MIP1α, MIP1β, and TNFα) that discriminated between patients with bacterial (n = 36) vs viral (n = 27) infections with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. When comparing patients with bacterial and mixed bacterial–viral infections (antibiotics clinically justified; n = 74) vs patients with viral and SARS-CoV-2 infections (antibiotics clinically not justified; n = 49), a 10-protein signature (CRP, bFGF, eotaxin, IFNγ, IL1β, IL7, IP10, MIP1α, MIP1β, and TNFα) with an AUC of 0.94 was identified. The transcriptional profiling analysis identified 232 differentially expressed genes distinguishing bacterial (n = 8) from viral and SARS-CoV-2 (n = 16) etiology. Protein–protein interaction enrichment analysis identified 20 genes that could be useful in the differentiation between bacterial and viral infections. Finally, we examined the performance of selected published gene signatures for bacterial–viral differentiation in our gene set, yielding promising results. Further validation of both protein and gene signatures in diverse clinical settings is warranted to establish their potential to guide the treatment of acute LRTIs. IMPORTANCE Accurate differentiation between bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) is vital for effective patient care and resource allocation. This study investigated specific protein signatures and gene expression patterns in plasma and blood samples from LRTI patients that distinguished bacterial and viral infections. The identified signatures can inform the design of point-of-care tests that can aid healthcare providers in making informed decisions about antibiotic prescriptions in order to reduce unnecessary use, thereby contributing to reduced side effects and antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the potential for faster and more accurate diagnoses for improved patient management in acute LRTIs is compelling.">

        <tr id="Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a neurotropic member of the genus Orthoflavivirus (former Flavivirus) and is of significant health concern in Europe and Asia. TBEV pathogenesis may occur directly via virus-induced damage to neurons or through immunopathology due to excessive inflammation. While primary cells isolated from the host can be used to study the immune response to TBEV, it is still unclear how well these reflect the immune response elicited in vivo. Here, we compared the transcriptional response to TBEV and the less pathogenic tick-borne flavivirus, Langat virus (LGTV), in primary monocultures of neurons, astrocytes and microglia in vitro, with the transcriptional response in vivo captured by single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of a whole mouse cortex. We detected similar transcriptional changes induced by both LGTV and TBEV infection in vitro, with the lower response to LGTV likely resulting from slower viral kinetics. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a stronger transcriptional response in vivo than in vitro for astrocytes and microglia, with a limited overlap mainly dominated by interferon signaling. Together, this adds to our understanding of neurotropic flavivirus pathogenesis and the strengths and limitations of available model systems.">

        <tr id="Mucosal immunity plays a crucial role in defending against coronaviruses, particularly at respiratory sites, serving as the first line of defense against viral invasion and replication. Coronaviruses have developed various immune evasion strategies at the mucosal immune system, hindering the recognition of infected cells and evading antibody responses. Understanding the immune mechanisms and responses is crucial for developing effective vaccines and therapeutics against coronaviruses. The role of mucosal immunity in COVID-19 is significant, influencing both local and systemic immune responses to the virus. Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Mucosally delivered vaccines and those under clinical trials are being compared and contrasted to understand their effectiveness in inducing mucosal immunity against coronaviruses. A greater understanding of lung tissue-based immunity may lead to improved diagnostic and prognostic procedures and novel treatment strategies aimed at reducing the disease burden of community-acquired pneumonia, avoiding the systemic manifestations of infection and excess morbidity and mortality. This comprehensive review article outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. It also proposes that there is a significant role for mucosal immunity and for secretory as well as circulating IgA antibodies in COVID-19, and that it is important to elucidate this in order to comprehend especially the asymptomatic and mild states of the infection, which appear to account for the majority of cases. Moreover, it is possible that mucosal immunity can be exploited for beneficial diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes. The findings from recent studies on mucosal immunity in COVID-19 can be used to develop effective vaccines and treatments that can effectively target both mucosal and systemic immune responses.">

        <tr id="A severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifests as systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement is called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). This review examines the possible relationship between gut barrier integrity, the microbiome, dysregulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling, and MIS-C. Clinical and biochemical features of MIS-C are comparable to those of other hyper-inflammatory syndromes, suggesting a dysregulated immune response. One possible explanation for the systemic inflammation seen in MIS-C patients is the SARS-CoV-2-induced dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathway. In addition, new data suggest a reciprocal link between gut barrier integrity and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits bacteriophage-like behavior, highlighting the role of bacteria as a reservoir for the virus and emphasizing the importance of understanding the bacteriophagic mechanism of the virus in fecal–oral transmission. The increased translocation of viral products and bacterial toxins may result from disrupting the intestinal barrier and cause systemic inflammation. On the other hand, systemic inflammation can weaken the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which feeds back into the loop of immunological dysregulation. In the context of MIS-C, understanding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection, IL-6, and gut barrier integrity may shed light on the etiology of the disease and guide treatment options. Since children with gut dysbiosis may be more susceptible to MIS-C, it is critical to reinforce their microbiome through probiotics supplementation, and plant-fiber-rich diets (prebiotics). Early antibiotic treatment and the use of zonulin antagonists should also be considered.">

        <tr id="Our study investigates the persistent cardiovascular symptoms observed in individuals long after contracting SARS-CoV-2, a condition commonly referred to as ?Long COVID?, which has significantly affected millions globally. We meticulously describe the cardiovascular outcomes in five patients, encompassing a range of severe conditions such as sudden cardiac death during exercise, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, acute inferior myocardial infarction, and acute myocarditis. All five patients were diagnosed with myocarditis, confirmed through endomyocardial biopsy and histochemical staining, which identified inflammatory cell infiltration in their heart tissue. Crucially, electron microscopy revealed widespread mitochondrial vacuolations and the presence of myofilament degradation within the cardiomyocytes of these patients. These findings were mirrored in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, suggesting a potential underlying cellular mechanism for the cardiac effects associated with Long COVID. Our report sheds light on the cardiovascular implications of Long COVID and underscores the importance of further research to understand its cellular underpinnings.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism and mechanisms implicated in cardiac damage in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was completely restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible. Author Summary Mosquito-borne viruses, such as those within the alphavirus genus, are an ongoing concern to human health globally. While we have recently begun to explore the mechanisms of CHIKV-induced pathology in the heart, little is known about other arboviruses and alphaviruses related to CHIKV. Here, we identified that multiple cardiac cell types are susceptible to infection by several arboviruses important to public health. Specifically, we noted differences in how two related viruses, CHIKV and MAYV, infect endothelial cells from multiple origins. This work highlights the potential for other emerging arboviruses, in addition to CHIKV, to directly infect cardiac tissue. Moreover, it emphasizes the ability for MAYV, an emerging virus that is less studied, to infect various endothelial cell types to high titers, suggesting the need for further research on MAYV pathogenesis. Finally, this research identifies differences in infection between individual strains of CHIKV, suggesting a finely tuned mechanism of restriction in endothelial cells that can be further explored, as well as the need to study use different viral strains for future alphavirus research.">

        <tr id="Introduction As the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to evolve and new variants emerge, it becomes crucial to understand the comparative pathological and immunological responses elicited by different strains. This study focuses on the original Wuhan strain and the Omicron variant, which have demonstrated significant differences in clinical outcomes and immune responses. Methods We employed ferrets as an experimental model to assess the D614G variant (a derivative of the Wuhan strain) and the Omicron BA.5 variant. Each variant was inoculated into separate groups of ferrets to compare disease severity, viral dissemination, and immune responses. Results The D614G variant induced more severe disease and greater viral spread than the Omicron variant. Notably, ferrets infected with the D614G variant exhibited a robust neutralizing antibody response, whereas those infected with the Omicron variant failed to produce a detectable neutralizing antibody response. Despite the clearance of the virus from nearly all tissues by 7 days post-infection, an increase in pathological lesions was observed from 14 to 21 days, particularly in those infected with the D614G variant, suggesting a sustained immune response even after viral clearance. Discussion These findings underscore the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 and illuminate how susceptibility and clinical manifestations vary across different strains and species. The results emphasize the necessity of considering both the direct effects of viral infection and the indirect, often prolonged, impacts of the immune response in evaluating the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="Immunological imprinting by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strains is thought to impede the robust induction of Omicron-specific humoral responses by Omicron-based booster vaccines. Here, we analyzed the specificity and neutralization activity of memory B (Bmem) cells after repeated BA.5 exposure in individuals previously imprinted by ancestral strain–based mRNA vaccines. After a second BA.5 exposure, Bmem cells with BA.5 spike protein–skewed reactivity were promptly elicited, correlating with preexisting antibody titers. Clonal lineage analysis identified BA.5-skewed Bmem cells that had redirected their specificity from the ancestral strain to BA.5 through somatic hypermutations. Moreover, Bmem cells with redirected BA.5 specificity exhibited accelerated development compared with de novo Bmem cells derived from naïve repertoires. This redirected BA.5 specificity demonstrated greater resilience to viral point mutation and adaptation to recent Omicron variants HK.3 and JN.1, months after the second BA.5 exposure, suggesting that existing Bmem cells elicited by older vaccines can redirect their specificity toward newly evolving variants. Immunological imprinting to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by memory B cells is redirected toward Omicron sublineages after repeated BA.5 exposures. Editor’s summary As the world’s population continues to be reexposed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein through infection or vaccination, immunologists have raised concerns about immune imprinting, where memory B cells directed against older strains prohibit B cells targeting newer strains from emerging. However, Kotaki et al. found that, at least for repeated exposures to the Omicron BA.5 variant spike protein, ancestral strain–primed memory B cell responses are not misdirected; rather, older memory B cells became redirected away from the ancestral strain and toward BA.5. The authors used clonal lineage analysis to confirm that the ancestral strain–skewed B cells became redirected toward BA.5 and were not derived from de novo B cell responses. Antibodies derived from these redirected B cells were also able to neutralize more recent Omicron variants, supporting the continued use of updated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="Background Broad T cell phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions were prominent in COVID-19. There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Methods We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients. Conclusion The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Long COVID is a complex condition where symptoms persist for more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and affects an estimated 5-30% of individuals. While the pathobiology of long COVID is still evolving, persistent inflammation has emerged as an important feature of this condition. However, it is unclear if immune responses from COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 re-infection exacerbate or mirror the initial inflammatory responses. To address this question, we quantified 182 inflammatory and neurology-related proteins in plasma using multiplexed affinity proteomics. Plasma samples were collected 6-9 months after first infection, but before COVID-19 vaccination from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 (n=21) or from individuals with long COVID (n=12). This was benchmarked against plasma from unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals (n=24). In addition to this cross-sectional analysis, we performed longitudinal analysis in a subset of individuals (n=34), where paired samples collected 2-4 weeks after a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and after SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection were available. Boruta feature selection and lasso regression models identified a distinct plasma profile in long COVID individuals, characterised by elevated IL-20, HAGH, NAAA, CLEC10A, LXN, and MCP-1 and reduced TRAIL, G-CSF, NBL1, and CCL23 protein concentrations. Notably, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that neither COVID-19 booster vaccination nor breakthrough infection replicated inflammatory and neurology-related plasma protein profiles observed after primary infection suggesting an altered immune response outcome in individuals with long COVID upon re-exposure.">

        <tr id="Rationale The lung is a unique immunological niche with diverse immune cell types. The effects of stimulation through innate and adaptive immune receptors on human lung immune cells has largely been extrapolated from studies of blood immune cells. While multiple immune cell types and many genes have been implicated as contributing to asthma, the dynamics of these in human lung immune cells following activation will yield insights into asthma pathogenesis and lung immunity more broadly. Methods and Measurements Human lung immune cells from 6 donors were isolated. Mixed leukocytes were treated separately with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), F(ab’)2-anti-human-IgM/IgG + IL4 and anti-CD3/CD28 for 4 and 18 hours and underwent single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Lung immune cell types were annotated, and gene expression compared across conditions. Genes at prior asthma-associated genetic loci were characterized across cell types, treatments and timepoints. Expression of non-classical class II genes associated with asthma, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2, and their protein products was characterized with immunohistochemistry. Main Results We characterized gene expression in 116,697 lung immune cells. Cell-, treatment-, and timepoint-specific effects on gene expression were detected in all lung immune cell populations. Correlation of gene expression between lung and blood lymphocyte populations decreased following stimulation. Among the genes that were differentially expressed, 97 receptor:ligand pairs had changes with treatments. 96.0% of genes at asthma risk loci demonstrated differential expression in at least one cell type and at least one treatment. B cells were the cell type with the highest expression of HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 which increased with anti-IgM/IgG treatment and the HLA-DQβ2 protein was identified in lung B cells from a donor with asthma. Conclusions Human lung immune activation elicits a broad range of cellular responses that deviate from those of blood immune cells and are relevant to asthma. Lung B cells expressing HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 appear to be involved in a novel antigen presentation pathway that contributes to asthma risk.">

        <tr id="Aging is physiologically associated with a decline in the function of the immune system and subsequent susceptibility to infections. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key element in the activation of cellular immunity, plays an important role in defense against virus infections. Decreased levels of IFN-γ in the elderly may explain their increased risk for viral infectious diseases such as COVID-19. There is accumulating evidence that ascorbic acid (vitamin C [VitC]) and α-tocopherol together help improve the function of the immune system in the elderly, control infections, and decrease the treatment duration. A SARS-CoV-2 strain was isolated from a patient and then cultured in the Vero cell line. The isolated and propagated virus was then inactivated using formalin and purified by the column chromatography. The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was formulated in the Alum adjuvant combined with VitC or α-tocopherol and/or both of them. The vaccines were injected twice to young and aged C57BL/6 mice. Two weeks later, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-2 cytokines were assessed using ELISA Kits. Specific IgG and IgG1/IgG2a were assessed by an in-house ELISA. In addition, the expression of PD1 and TERT genes in the spleen tissue of the mice was measured using real-time PCR. IL-4 and IFN-γ cytokines showed a significant increase in both aged and young mice compared with the Alum-based vaccine. In addition, our results exhibited a significant decrease and increase in specific total IgG and the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, respectively. Furthermore, the vaccine formulated in α-tocopherol + VitC led to decreased PD1 and increased TERT gene expression levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that α-tocopherol + VitC formulated in the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine led to a shift toward Th1, which may be due to their effect on the physiology of cells, especially aged ones and changing their phenotype toward young cells.">

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are highly sensitive to COVID-19, in-depth study and understanding of the mechanism of action and prevention and treatment strategies of CKD patients infected with novel coronavirus appears to be crucial. This article explored the selected topic by combing the relevant literature, and summarized the susceptibility to COVID-19 and the mechanism of renal involvement in CKD patients; the article shows that COVID-19 mainly enters the cells with ACE2 as the receptor to damage the kidneys directly, but also through cytokine storm, endothelial damage, immune dysregulation and other indirect ways of renal damage.">

        <tr id="Rhinovirus C (RV-C) infects airway epithelial cells and is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in humans. To interrogate the mechanisms of RV-C-mediated disease, animal models are essential. Towards this, RV-C infection was recently reported in wild-type (WT) mice, yet, titers were not sustained. Therefore, the requirements for RV-C infection in mice remain unclear. Notably, prior work has implicated human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as essential host factors for virus uptake and replication, respectively. Here, we report that even though human (h) and murine (m) CDHR3 orthologs have similar tissue distribution, amino acid sequence homology is limited. Further, while RV-C can replicate in mouse lung epithelial type 1 (LET1) cells and produce infectious virus, we observed a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of dsRNA-positive cells following hSTING expression. Based on these findings, we sought to assess the impact of hCDHR3 and hSTING on RV-C infection in mice in vivo. Thus, we developed hCDHR3 transgenic mice, and utilized adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver hSTING to the murine airways. Subsequent challenge of these mice with RV-C15 revealed significantly higher titers 24 h post-infection in mice expressing both hCDHR3 and hSTING—compared to either WT mice, or mice with hCDHR3 or hSTING alone, indicating more efficient infection. Ultimately, this mouse model can be further engineered to establish a robust in vivo model, recapitulating viral dynamics and disease.">

        <tr id="Neutralizing antibody responses correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet higher neutralizing responses associate with more severe disease. Whether people without severe disease can also develop strong neutralizing responses to infection, and the pathways involved, is less clear. We performed a proteomic analysis on sera from 71 individuals infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, enrolled during the first South African infection wave. We determined disease severity by whether participants required supplemental oxygen and measured neutralizing antibody levels at convalescence. High neutralizing antibodies were associated with high disease severity, yet 40% of participants with lower disease severity had neutralizing antibody levels comparable to those with severe disease. We found 130 differentially expressed proteins between high and low neutralizers and 40 between people with high versus low disease severity. Five proteins overlapped, including furin, a protease which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. High neutralizers with non-severe disease had similar levels of differentially expressed neutralization response proteins to high neutralizers with severe disease, yet similar levels of differentially expressed disease severity proteins to participants with non-severe disease. Furthermore, we could reasonably predict who developed a strong neutralizing response based on a single protein, HSPA8, involved in clathrin pit uncoating. These results indicate that a strong antibody response does not always require severe disease and may involve different pathways.">

        <tr id="Diabetes, a prevalent chronic condition, significantly increases the risk of mortality from COVID-19, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Emerging evidence implicates Cathepsin L (CTSL) in diabetic complications, including nephropathy and retinopathy. Our previous research identified CTSL as a pivotal protease promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate elevated blood CTSL levels in individuals with diabetes, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia correlates positively with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients, while acute hyperglycemia augments CTSL activity in healthy individuals. In vitro studies reveal high glucose, but not insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells, with CTSL knockout cells displaying reduced susceptibility. Utilizing lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, alongside Leprdb/dbmice and Leprdb/+mice, we illustrate increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation in diabetic comorbidities and complications.">

        <tr id="The pathophysiological mechanisms of the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) remain unclear. Sex differences not only exist in the disease severity of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but also in the risk of suffering from PASC. Women have a higher risk of suffering from PASC and a longer time to resolution than men. To explore the possible immune mechanisms of PASC among non-elderly females, we mined single-cell transcriptome data from peripheral blood samples of non-elderly female patients with PASC and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with age- and gender-matched non-PASC and healthy controls available from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. By comparing the differences, we found that a CD14+ monocyte subset characterized by higher expression of signal transducers and activators of transcription 2 (STAT2) (CD14+STAT2high) was notably increased in the PASC patients compared with the non-PASC individuals. The transcriptional factor (TF) activity analysis revealed that STAT2 and IRF9 were the key TFs determining the function of CD14+STAT2high monocytes. STAT2 and IRF9 are TFs exclusively involving type I and III interferon (IFN) signaling pathways, resulting in uncontrolled IFN-I signaling activation and type I interferonopathy. Furthermore, increased expression of common interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) has also been identified in most monocyte subsets among the non-elderly female PASC patients, including IFI6, IFITM3, IFI44L, IFI44, EPSTI1, ISG15, and MX1. This study reveals a featured CD14+STAT2high monocyte associated with uncontrolled IFN-I signaling activation, which is indicative of a possible type I interferonopathy in the non-elderly female patients with PASC.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by chronic inflammation and damage to the central nervous system, and substantial characterization of molecular signatures of glial and immune cells in the disease has been conducted. However, comparatively less well characterized is the molecular signature of pathologically inflamed neurons. Here, we accessed multi-omic high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic data to investigate the molecular signature of neurons from progressive MS patients and from mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results indicate a shared and consistent neuronal gene expression signature in MS and EAE samples including a notable upregulation of immune system related genes and processes. Analysis of immune-enriched pathways in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and motor neurons from mice subjected to EAE revealed enrichment for the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway and interferon response genes in both types of neurons, and ATAC-seq analysis confirmed the accessibility of these genes. Parallel analyses of neurons from MS patients identified a signature of 48 commonly upregulated immune genes in neurons. Prediction of transcriptional regulators of these genes identified key upstream regulators including signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon response factor 5 (IRF5), highly involved in immune-related processes, with significant gene expression changes in both RGCs and motor neurons. Protein-protein interaction analyses among the transcriptional regulators unveiled intricate interactions among transcription factors, especially from the IRF and STAT families, suggesting their importance in regulating immune gene expression in inflamed neurons. Small molecule inhibition of IRF5 in inflamed neurons in vitro promoted cell survival and reduced the expression of the immune gene signature, supporting the biological relevance of IRF5 in mediating the neuronal inflammatory response. Together, this study identifies regulated immune processes in neurons from EAE mice and from MS patient samples suggesting potential roles for neuronal immune molecules in disease progression, as revealed by transcriptomic, epigenomic, and experimental approaches. Further, the results strongly implicate active interferon signaling in neurons driving immune related changes in gene expression through IRF5 and STAT1 transcription factor activity, potentially impacting downstream neuronal survival through IRF5 activity.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives: The study aims to explore the potential for transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2, focusing on its pathophysiology, placental defense mechanisms, and the clinical implications for maternal and neonatal health. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive review of the current literature was conducted, analyzing studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, the expression of key viral receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in placental cells, and the immune responses involved in placental defense. The review also examined the clinical outcomes related to maternal and neonatal health, including adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. Results: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the placenta supports the biological plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 transplacental transmission. Histopathological findings from the infected placentas reveal inflammation, vascular changes, and the evidence of viral particles in placental tissues. Clinical reports indicate an increased risk of preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and neonatal infection in pregnancies affected by COVID-19. However, the frequency and mechanisms of vertical transmission remain variable across studies, highlighting the need for standardized research protocols. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 can potentially infect placental cells, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. While evidence of transplacental transmission has been documented, the risk and mechanisms are not fully understood. Ongoing research is essential to clarify these aspects and inform obstetric care practices to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="With circulation of SARS-CoV-2, fears about coinfection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV were significant, but the opposite was observed. Distancing/barriers played a major role in reducing other viral co-infections, however, some infrequent co-infections still occurred. We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RSV during coinfection to understand how they might compete or synergize. We found only RSV’s replication was significantly reduced when coinfected with SARS-CoV-2. Investigation of the mechanism revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp1 disrupts the RSV M2-2 protein but not the upstream M2-1 protein on the same biscistronic mRNA transcript. The impact of Nsp1 on M2-2 was not dependent on M2-2 being the second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA transcript, but likely from prevention of ribosomal termination-reinitiation necessary for M2-2 production. Additional viral ORFs from influenza A, influenza B, or Sendai virus dependent on the same or other ribosomal initiation mechanisms were tested and we found only influenza B M/M2 which likely uses a similar method as M2-2 was disrupted. Various M2-2 constructs, with/without the proposed site of ribosomal termination-reinitiating, co-transfected with Nsp1 and were in agreement that disruption to M2-2 expression occurs if the site of re-initiation was present upstream. These data not only suggest Sars-CoV-2 can outcompete RSV through suppression of M2, but may also point to potential ways to interfere with RSV by targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, particularly causes severe inflammatory disease in elderly, obese, and male patients. Since both aging and obesity are associated with decreased testosterone and estradiol expression, we hypothesized that decreased hormone levels contribute to excessive inflammation in the context of COVID-19. Previously, we and others have shown that hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 patients is induced by the production of pathogenic anti-spike IgG antibodies that activate alveolar macrophages. Therefore, we developed an in vitro assay in which we stimulated human macrophages with viral stimuli, anti-spike IgG immune complexes, and different sex hormones. Treatment with levels of testosterone reflecting young adults led to a significant reduction in TNF and IFN-γ production by human macrophages. In addition, estradiol significantly attenuated the production of a very broad panel of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ. Both testosterone and estradiol reduced the expression of Fc gamma receptors IIa and III, the two main receptors responsible for anti-spike IgG-induced inflammation. Combined, these findings indicate that sex hormones reduce the inflammatory response of human alveolar macrophages to specific COVID-19-associated stimuli, thereby providing a potential immunological mechanism for the development of severe COVID-19 in both older male and female patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Throughout history, the influenza A virus has caused numerous devastating global pandemics. Macrophages, as pivotal innate immune cells, exhibit a wide range of immune functions characterized by distinct polarization states, reflecting their intricate heterogeneity. In this study, we employed the time-resolved single-cell sequencing technique coupled with metabolic RNA labelling to elucidate the dynamic transcriptional changes in distinct polarized states of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon infection with the influenza A virus. Our approach not only captures the temporal dimension of transcriptional activity, which is lacking in conventional scRNA-seq methods, but also reveals that M2-polarized Arg1_macrophage cluster is the sole state supporting successful replication of influenza A virus. Furthermore, we identified distinct antigen presentation capabilities to CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells across diverse polarized states of macrophages. Notably, the M1 phenotype, exhibited by (BMDMs) and murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), demonstrated superior conventional and cross-presentation abilities for exogenous antigens, with a particular emphasis on cross-presentation capacity. Additionally, as CD8+ T cell differentiation progressed, M1 polarization exhibited an enhanced capacity for cross-presentation. All three phenotypes of BMDMs, including M1, demonstrated robust presentation to CD4+ regulatory T cells, while displaying limited ability to present to naive CD4+ T cells. These findings offer novel insights into the immunological regulatory mechanisms governing distinct polarized states of macrophages, particularly their roles in restricting the replication of influenza A virus and modulating antigen-specific T cell responses through innate immunity.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Pro-resolving molecules may curb disease caused by viruses without altering the capacity of the host to deal with infection. AP1189 is a melanocortin receptor-biased agonist endowed with pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory activity. We evaluated the preclinical and early clinical effects of treatment with AP1189 in the context of COVID-19.


METHODS
C57BL/6j mice were infected intranasally with MHV-A59 or hK18-ACE2 mice with SARS-CoV-2. AP1189 (10 mg·kg-1, BID, s.c.) was given to the animals from day 2 and parameters evaluated at day 5. Human PBMCs from health donors were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in presence or absence of AP1189 and production of cytokines quantified. In the clinical study, 6 patients were initially given AP1189 (100 mg daily for 14 days) and this was followed by a randomized (2:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that enrolled 54 hospitalized COVID-19 patients needing oxygen support. The primary outcome was the time in days until respiratory recovery, defined as a SpO2 ≥ 93% in ambient air.


RESULTS
Treatment with AP1189 attenuated pulmonary inflammation in mice infected with MHV-A59 or SARS-CoV-2 and decreased the release of CXCL10, TNF-α and IL-1β by human PBMCs. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients already taking glucocorticoids took a median time of 6 days until respiratory recovery when given placebo versus 4 days when taking AP1189 (P = 0.017).


CONCLUSION
Treatment with AP1189 was associated with less disease caused by beta-coronavirus infection both in mice and in humans. This is the first demonstration of the effects of a pro-resolving molecule in the context of severe infection in humans.">

        <tr id="The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and enduring impact, resulting in substantial loss of life. The scientific community has responded unprecedentedly by investigating various aspects of the crisis, particularly focusing on the acute phase of COVID-19. The roles of the viral load, cytokines, and chemokines during the acute phase and in the context of patients who experienced enduring symptoms upon infection, so called Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 or PASC, have been studied extensively. Here, in this review, we offer a virologist’s perspective on PASC, highlighting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, cytokines, and chemokines in different organs of patients across the full clinical spectrum of acute-phase disease. We underline that the probability of severe or critical disease progression correlates with increased viral load levels detected in the upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT), and plasma. Acute-phase viremia is a clear, although not unambiguous, predictor of PASC development. Moreover, both the quantity and diversity of functions of cytokines and chemokines increase with acute-phase disease severity. Specific cytokines remain or become elevated in the PASC phase, although the driving factor of ongoing inflammation found in patients with PASC remains to be investigated. The key findings highlighted in this review contribute to a further understanding of PASC and their differences and overlap with acute disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes a persistent infection in sensory ganglia. The infection manifests itself as genital herpes but in rare cases it can cause meningitis. In this study, we used a murine model of HSV-2 meningitis to show that Fas and FasL are induced within the CNS upon HSV-2 infection, both on resident microglia and astrocytes and on infiltrating monocytes and lymphocytes. Mice lacking Fas or FasL had a more severe disease development with significantly higher morbidity, mortality, and an overall higher CNS viral load. In parallel, these Fas/FasL-deficient mice showed a severely impaired infection-induced CNS inflammatory response with lower levels of infiltrating CD4+ T-cells, lower levels of Th1 cytokines and chemokines, and a shift in the balance between M1 and M2 microglia/monocytes. In vitro, we confirmed that Fas and FasL is required for the induction of leucocyte apoptosis, but also show that the Fas/FasL pathway is required for adequate cytokine and chemokine production by glial cells. In summary, our data show that the Fas/FasL cell death receptor pathway is an important defense mechanism in the spinal cord as it down-regulates HSV-2-induced inflammation while at the same time promoting adequate anti-viral immune responses against infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is one of the most prevalent respiratory pathogens in horses with a high impact on animal health worldwide. Entry of the virus into epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and rapid local viral replication is followed by infection of local lymphoid tissues leading to cell-associated viremia and disease progression. Pre-existing mucosal immunity has previously been shown to reduce viral shedding and prevent viremia, consequently limiting severe disease manifestations. Here, nasopharyngeal transcriptomic profiling was used to identify differentially expressed genes following EHV-1 challenge in horses with different EHV-1 immune statuses. Immune horses (n = 4) did neither develop clinical disease nor viremia and did not shed virus after experimental infection, while non-immune horses (n = 4) did all the above. RNA sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal samples pre- and 24 hours post-infection (24hpi). At 24hpi, 109 and 44 genes were upregulated in immune horses and non-immune horses, respectively, and three genes were explored in further detail. Antileukoproteinase (SLPI) gene expression increased 2.1-fold within 24 hours in immune horses in concert with protein secretion. Interferon (IFN)-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) and 3 (IFIT3) were upregulated in non-immune horses, corresponding with nasal IFN-α secretion and viral replication. By contrast, neither IFIT expression nor IFN-α secretion was induced by EHV-1 infection of immune horses. Transcriptomic profiling offered a tool to identify, for the first time, the role of SLPI in innate immunity against EHV-1, and further emphasized the central role of the type I IFN response in the anti-viral defense of non-immune horses. IMPORTANCE Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) remains a considerable concern in the equine industry, with yearly outbreaks resulting in morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. In addition to its importance in equine health, EHV-1 is a respiratory pathogen and an alphaherpesvirus, and it may serve as a model for other viruses with similar pathogenicity or phylogeny. Large animal models allow the collection of high-volume samples longitudinally, permitting in-depth investigation of immunological processes. This study was performed on bio-banked nasopharyngeal samples from an EHV-1 infection experiment, where clinical outcomes had previously been determined. Matched nucleic acid and protein samples throughout infection permitted longitudinal quantification of the protein or related proteins of selected differentially expressed genes detected during the transcriptomic screen. The results of this manuscript identified novel innate immune pathways of the upper respiratory tract during the first 24 hours of EHV-1 infection, offering a first look at the components of early mucosal immunity that are indicative of protection.">

        <tr id="Abstract The primary immune constituents in the brain, microglia and macrophages, are the target for HIV in people and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological dysfunction, known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Given the gaps in our knowledge on how these cells respond in vivo to CNS infection, we performed single-cell multiomic sequencing, including gene expression and ATAC-seq, on myeloid cells from the brains of rhesus macaques with SIV-induced encephalitis (SIVE) as well as uninfected controls. We found that the myeloid cell populations were significantly changed by SIVE. In SIVE microglia-like cells express high levels of chemoattractants capable of recruiting highly activated CAM-like cells to the site of infection/inflammation. A unique population of microglia-like cells was found in which the chromatin accessibility of genes diverged from their RNA expression. Additionally, we observed a dramatic shift of upstream gene regulators and their targets in brain myeloid cells during SIVE. In summary, this study further uncovers the transcriptome, gene regulatory events and potential roles of different brain myeloid phenotypes in SIVE.">

        <tr id="Although the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), primarily manifests as severe respiratory distress, its impact on the cardiovascular system is also notable. Studies reveal that COVID-19 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID-19 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely under-reviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID-19 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Limited data are available describing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections on the plasma proteome. Methods PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients, enrolled in a natural history study, underwent analysis of the plasma proteome. A prospective cohort of 66 unvaccinated and 24 vaccinated persons with different degrees of infection severity were evaluated acutely (within 40 days of symptom onset), and at three and ten months. Comparisons based on vaccination status alone and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were performed. A second cohort of vaccinated Omicron patients were evaluated acutely and at ten months. Results Acutely, unvaccinated patients manifested overexpression of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory responses, while vaccinated patients exhibited adaptive immune responses without significant inflammation. At three and ten months, only unvaccinated patients had diminished but sustained inflammatory (C3b, CCL15, IL17RE) and immune responses (DEFA5,TREM1). Both groups had underexpression of pathways essential for cellular function, signaling, and angiogenesis (AKT1, MAPK14, HSPB1) across phases. Unsupervised clustering, based on protein expression, identified four groups of patients with variable vaccination rates demonstrating that additional clinical factors influence the plasma proteome. The proteome of vaccinated Omicron patients did not differ from vaccinated pre-Omicron patients. Conclusions Vaccination attenuates the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection across phases. However, at ten months after symptom onset, changes in the plasma proteome persist in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, which may be relevant to post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections associated with post-acute infection syndromes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains an international health problem caused by the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of May 2024, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths globally. Despite current vaccination programs, infections are still rapidly increasing, mainly due to the appearance and spread of new variants, variations in immunization rates, and limitations of current vaccines in preventing transmission. This underscores the need for pan-variant antivirals and treatments. The interferon (IFN) system is a critical element of the innate immune response and serves as a frontline defense against viruses. It induces a generalized antiviral state by transiently upregulating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To gain a deeper comprehension of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, its connection to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and the potential therapeutic implications, this review provides a detailed overview of fundamental aspects of the diverse ISGs identified for their antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. It emphasizes the importance of these proteins in controlling viral replication and spread. Furthermore, we explore methodological approaches for the identification of ISGs and conduct a comparative analysis with other viruses. Deciphering the roles of ISGs and their interactions with viral pathogens can help identify novel targets for antiviral therapies and enhance our preparedness to confront current and future viral threats.">

        <tr id="Mitochondria play pivotal roles in sustaining various biological functions including energy metabolism, cellular signaling transduction, and innate immune responses. Viruses exploit cellular metabolic synthesis to facilitate viral replication, potentially disrupting mitochondrial functions and subsequently eliciting a cascade of proinflammatory responses in host cells. Additionally, the disruption of mitochondrial membranes is involved in immune regulation. During viral infections, mitochondria orchestrate innate immune responses through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of mitochondrial DNA, which serves as an effective defense mechanism against virus invasion. The targeting of mitochondrial damage may represent a novel approach to antiviral intervention. This review summarizes the regulatory mechanism underlying proinflammatory response induced by mitochondrial damage during viral infections, providing new insights for antiviral strategies.">

        <tr id="The enduring impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its disease manifestation, COVID-19, on public health remains significant. Postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) affect a considerable number of patients, impairing their quality of life. While the role of the cytokine storm in acute COVID-19 is well established, its contribution to the pathophysiology of PASC is not fully understood. This study aimed to analyze the cytokine profile of patients with PASC following in vitro stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, comparing them with a healthy control group. From October 2020 till March 2021, Brugmann University Hospital's clinical research unit included patients with PASC in the study. Whole blood samples were collected from 50 patients and 25 healthy volunteers. After in vitro stimulation under five different conditions, cytokine levels were measured using a multiplex method. Significantly decreased cytokine levels were observed in patients with PASC compared with healthy volunteers, particularly after TLR4 (interleukin [IL]-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-10, interferon (IFN)α, IFNγ, IFNω, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α) and TLR7/8 (IL-1α, IL-1β, IFNα, IFNω, IFNγ, and TNFα) pathway stimulation. Principal component analysis identified two distinct clusters, suggesting a likely dysregulation of immunity involving TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways in patients with PASC. Our study suggests that TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways play a role in the pathophysiology of PASC. Continuous basal activation of immunity could explain the high basal concentrations of cytokines described in these patients and the decreased amplitude of response of these signaling pathways following specific stimulation.">

        <tr id="Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common major complication of preterm birth. Supplemental oxygen administration, while lifesaving in the neonatal period, remains a key determinant of BPD pathophysiology. Exposure of the immature lung to increased levels of oxygen elicits an inflammatory response resulting in abnormal lung development. However, not every premature infant is equally sensitive to develop BPD. Using genetically diverse mouse strains, we show that the innate immune response activated in the lungs of mice sensitive to hyperoxia that develop BPD-like lung injury differs from mice resilient to disease. Specifically, we identified a selective upregulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) on lung macrophages and monocytes in the hyperoxia-sensitive C57BL/6J mouse strain. We show that loss of function of TREM2 signaling in myeloid cells resulted in a dramatically improved phenotype after neonatal hyperoxia exposure characterized by a dampened immune response, preserved alveolar structure, and preserved cell proliferative potential supporting normal lung development. At the molecular level, inhibition of TREM2 signaling dampened the magnitude of p53 activation and resulted in cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. These findings show that TREM2 is a critical regulator of the pathogenic innate immune response to hyperoxia and highlight its importance as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating injury in the hyperoxia-exposed developing lung.">

AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of trained immunity by reprogramming hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow generating trained innate cells with enhanced responsiveness. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung via neutrophils and IFNγ signalling, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (LPS) or viral (polyI:C) challenges. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.">

        <tr id="Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often causes coagulation disorders that affect highly vascularized organs, such as the lungs and kidneys.

Objective
The objective of this study was to report the histopathological findings of variations in the fibrin pattern of pulmonary and renal microthrombi in patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
Minimally invasive autopsies were performed on 40 patients to collect lung (n=40) and kidney (n=16) tissue samples. Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining techniques were used for histopathological analyses. Premortem laboratory data were obtained from the patients' electronic medical records.

Results
The lung tissue showed a patchy pattern, characterized by areas of both minimal and severe damage. The most significant histopathological finding was the detection of thrombi with fibrin structures organized into discrete star-shaped units, which were more frequently observed in areas with severe lung injury than in those with minimal lung injury (p = 0.012). Star-shaped fibrin structures were also observed in the renal glomerular capillaries. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of platelets and the procoagulant proteins von Willebrand factor (VWF) and Factor VIII within the star-shaped fibrin thrombi. Patients with star-shaped fibrin thrombi had higher levels of the systemic inflammatory indicators C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).

Conclusion
Our observations suggest that the inflammatory microenvironment resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to the formation of star-shaped fibrin units in the pulmonary and renal microthrombi.">

        <tr id="IL-26 is a key mediator of pulmonary host defense given its abundant expression in human airways and its established antibacterial properties. Moreover, recent studies indicate that IL-26 can also inhibit viral replication. Along these lines, we have previously reported an increase in the plasma concentration of IL-26 among patients with acute COVID-19 that is linked to harmful hyperinflammation. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether this systemic increase in IL-26 relates to disease severity, sex, comorbidities, viral load, or the innate immune response in acute COVID-19.IL-26 was quantified using ELISA in plasma samples from a large cohort of well-characterized patients with acute COVID-19 (n=178) and healthy controls (n=30). The plasma concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike protein, as well as those of IFN-α2a, IFN-β, and IFN-γ, were determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The concentration of double-stranded DNA was determined using fluorometry.The plasma concentration of IL-26 was increased in patients with severe/critical COVID-19, particularly among males and patients with comorbid obstructive lung disease. Moreover, the concentration of IL-26 displayed positive correlations with length of hospital stay, as well as with systemic markers of viral load, antiviral immunity, and extracellular DNA.Systemic IL-26 is involved in severe COVID-19, especially in males and patients with comorbid obstructive lung disease. These findings argue that systemic IL-26 has pathogenic and antiviral relevance, as well as biomarker potential.">

They include a variety of symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of smell (anosmia), and neurological–cognitive sequelae, such as memory loss, anxiety, brain fog, acute encephalitis, and stroke, collectively called long neuro-COVID-19 (long neuro-COVID). They also include cardiopulmonary sequelae, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary damage, fibrosis, gastrointestinal dysregulation, renal failure, and vascular endothelial dysregulation, and the onset of new diabetes, with each symptom usually being treated individually. The main unmet challenge is to understand the mechanisms of the pathophysiologic sequelae, in particular the neurological symptoms. This mini-review presents the main mechanistic hypotheses considered to explain the multiple long neuro-COVID symptoms, namely immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation, persistent viral reservoirs, vascular and endothelial dysfunction, and the disruption of the neurotransmitter signaling along various paths. We suggest that the nucleoprotein N of SARS-CoV-2 constitutes a “hub” between the virus and the host inflammation, immunity, and neurotransmission.">

        <tr id="Background/Rationale We investigated the effect of pre-existing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human coronaviruses on infection outcomes in Omicron BA1/2 exposed household members from January to March 2022. Methods Data from a prospective household study in the Netherlands were used including 63 households with 195 household members exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA1/2 index case. The protocol included repeated nose-throat swab and saliva RT-PCR testing, paired serology, and self-reported daily symptom scoring by household members. Infection outcomes included the occurrence of secondary infections, symptom severity, and CT-value trajectories. We studied the effect of baseline binding antibody levels for SARS-CoVs and seasonal coronaviruses (hCoV) NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43 spike protein, on SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Results 132 of 195 (68%) exposed household members developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among exposed household members, higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 and beta hCoV antibodies (HKU1 and OC43) at baseline, were associated with a reduced risk of secondary infection (adjusted Odds ratio 0.61; 95% Confidence interval 0.44-0.84 and aOR 0.72; 95%CI 0.56-0.92, respectively). No significant differences between antibody levels and symptom burden or CT-value trajectories were observed. Conclusions Our study suggests that prior SARS-CoV-2 and beta hCoV antibodies provide some protection against Omicron BA.1/BA.2 infection, while effects on symptom burden or CT-value could not be demonstrated. The results highlight the relatively limited, but not negligible role of cross-protective antibodies, especially when facing immune escape variants of SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Background: A complement imbalance in lung alveolar tissue can play a deteriorating role in COVID-19, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CD55 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that inhibits the activation of the complement system at the intermediate cascade level, blocking the activity of the C3 convertase. Objective: In our study, lung specimens from COVID-19 and ARDS-positive COVID+/ARDS+ patients were compared with COVID-19 and ARDS-negative COVID–/ARDS– as well as COVID–/ARDS+ patients. Methods: Histochemical staining and immunolabeling of CD55 protein were performed. Results: The COVID–/ARDS– specimen showed higher expression and homogeneous distribution of glycosaminoglycans as well as compactly arranged elastic and collagen fibers of the alveolar walls in comparison to ARDS-affected lungs. In addition, COVID–/ARDS– lung tissues revealed stronger and homogenously distributed CD55 expression on the alveolar walls in comparison to the disrupted COVID–/ARDS+ lung tissues. Conclusions: Even though the collapse of the alveolar linings and the accumulation of cellular components in the alveolar spaces were characteristic of COVID+/ARDS+ lung tissues, evaluating CD55 expression could be relevant to understand its relation to the disease. Furthermore, targeting CD55 upregulation as a potential therapy could be an option for post-infectious complications of COVID-19 and other inflammatory lung diseases in the future.">

        <tr id="Introduction Influenza virus infections are a major global health problem. Influenza can result in mild/moderate disease or progress to more severe disease, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Severity is thought to be primarily driven by immunopathology, but predicting which individuals are at a higher risk of being hospitalized warrants investigation into host genetics and the molecular signatures of the host response during influenza infections. Methods Here, we performed transcriptome and genotype analysis in healthy controls and patients exhibiting mild/moderate or severe influenza (ICU patients). A unique aspect of our study was the genotyping of all participants, which allowed us to assign ethnicities based on genetic variation and assess whether the variation was correlated with expression levels. Results We identified 169 differentially expressed genes and related molecular pathways between patients in the ICU and those who were not in the ICU. The transcriptome/genotype association analysis identified 871 genes associated to a genetic variant and 39 genes distinct between African-Americans and Caucasians. We also investigated the effects of age and sex and found only a few discernible gene effects in our cohort. Discussion Together, our results highlight select risk factors that may contribute to an increased risk of ICU admission for influenza-infected patients. This should help to develop better diagnostic tools based on molecular signatures, in addition to a better understanding of the biological processes in the host response to influenza.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="Age-related susceptibility to sepsis and endotoxemia is poorly defined, although hyperactivation of the immune system and the expansion of the visceral adipose as an immunological reservoir are underlying features. Macrophages from older organisms exhibit substantial changes, including chronic NLRP3 inflammasome activation, genomic remodeling and a dysfunctional, amplified inflammatory response upon new exposure to pathogen. However, the mechanisms by which old macrophages maintain their inflammatory phenotype during endotoxemia remains elusive. We previously identified Gdf3, a TGFβ superfamily cytokine, as a top-regulated gene by age and the NLRP3 inflammasome in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Here, we demonstrate that endotoxemia increases inflammatory (CD11c+) ATMs in a Gdf3- dependent manner in old mice. Lifelong systemic or myeloid-specific deletion of Gdf3 leads to reduced endotoxemia- induced inflammation, with decreased CD11c+ ATMs and inflammatory cytokines, and protection from hypothermia. Moreover, acute blockade of Gdf3 using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, phenocopies old mice with lifelong Gdf3-deficiency. We show that GDF3 promotes the inflammatory phenotype in ATMs by phosphorylating SMAD2/3. Mechanistically, the differential chromatin landscape of ATMs from old mice with or without myeloid-driven Gdf3 indicates that GDF3- SMAD2/3 signaling axis shifts the chromatin accessibility of ATMs towards an inflammatory state during aging. Furthermore, pharmaceutical inhibition of SMAD3 with a specific inhibitor of SMAD3 (SIS3) mimics Gdf3 deletion. SIS3 reduces endotoxemia-mediated inflammation with fewer CD11c+ ATMs and less severe hypothermia in old, but not young mice, as well as reduced mortality. In human adipose tissue, age positively correlates with GDF3 level, while inflammation correlates with pSMAD2/3 level. Overall, these results highlight the importance of GDF3-SMAD2/3 axis in driving inflammation in older organisms and identify this signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating endotoxemia-related inflammation in the aged.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated severity have been linked to uncontrolled inflammation and may be associated with changes in the microbiome of mucosal sites including the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity. These sites play an important role in host-microbe homeostasis, and disruption of epithelial barrier integrity during COVID-19 may potentially lead to exacerbated inflammation and immune dysfunction. Outcomes in COVID-19 are highly disparate, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal, and the impact of microbial dysbiosis on disease severity is unclear. Here, we obtained plasma, rectal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasal swabs from 86 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 12 healthy volunteers. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the microbial communities in the mucosal swabs and measured concentrations of circulating cytokines, markers of gut barrier integrity, and fatty acids in the plasma samples. We compared these plasma concentrations and microbiomes between healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients, some of whom had unfortunately died by the end of the study enrollment, and performed a correlation analysis between plasma variables and bacterial abundances. Rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients had reduced abundances of several commensal bacteria including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increased abundance of the opportunistic pathogens Eggerthella lenta and Hungatella hathewayi. Furthermore, the oral pathogen Scardovia wiggsiae was more abundant in the oropharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients who died. The abundance of both H. hathewayi and S. wiggsiae correlated with circulating inflammatory markers including IL-6, highlighting the possible role of the microbiome in COVID-19 severity and providing potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19.IMPORTANCEOutcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are highly disparate and are associated with uncontrolled inflammation; however, the individual factors that lead to this uncontrolled inflammation are not fully understood. Here, we report that severe COVID-19 is associated with systemic inflammation, microbial translocation, and microbial dysbiosis. The rectal and oropharyngeal microbiomes of COVID-19 patients were characterized by a decreased abundance of commensal bacteria and an increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens, which positively correlated with markers of inflammation and microbial translocation. These microbial perturbations may, therefore, contribute to disease severity in COVID-19 and highlight the potential for microbiome-based interventions in improving COVID-19 outcomes.">

        <tr id="Lung tumor-promoting environmental exposures and γherpesvirus infections are associated with Type 17 inflammation. To test the effect of γherpesvirus infection in promoting lung tumorigenesis, we infected mutant K-Ras-expressing (K-RasLA1) mice with the murine γherpesvirus MHV68 via oropharyngeal aspiration. After 7 weeks, the infected mice displayed a more than 2-fold increase in lung tumors relative to their K-RasLA1 uninfected littermates. Assessment of cytokines in the lung revealed that expression of Type 17 cytokines (Il-6, Cxcl1, Csf3) peaked at day 7 post-infection. These observations correlated with the post-infection appearance of known immune mediators of tumor promotion via IL-17A in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice. Surprisingly, Cd84, an immune cell marker mRNA, did not increase in MHV68-infected wild-type mice lacking lung tumors. Csf3 and Cxcl1 protein levels increased more in the lungs of infected K-RasLA1 mice relative to infected wild-type littermates. Flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses indicated that the infected K-RasLA1 mice had increased Ly6Gdim/Ly6Chi immune cells in the lung relative to levels seen in uninfected control K-RasLA1 mice. Selective methylation of adenosines (m6A modification) in immune-cell-enriched mRNAs appeared to correlate with inflammatory infiltrates in the lung. These observations implicate γherpesvirus infection in lung tumor promotion and selective accumulation of immune cells in the lung that appears to be associated with m6A modification of mRNAs in those cells.">

        <tr id="Viral infection of cells leads to metabolic changes, but how viral infection changes whole-body and tissue metabolism in vivo has not been comprehensively studied. In particular, it is unknown how metabolism might be differentially affected by an acute infection that the immune system can successfully clear, compared to a chronic and persistent infection. Here we used metabolomics and isotope tracing to identify metabolic changes in mice infected with acute or chronic forms of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) for three or eight days. Both types of infection alter metabolite levels in blood and tissues, including itaconate and thymidine. However, we observed more dramatic metabolite changes in the blood and tissues of mice with chronic LCMV infection compared to those with acute infection. Isotope tracing revealed that the contribution of both glucose and glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle increase in the spleen, liver, and kidneys of mice infected with chronic LCMV, while acute LCMV only increases the contribution of glutamine to the TCA cycle in the spleen. We found that whole-body turnover of both glutamine and thymidine increase during acute and chronic infection, whereas whole-body glucose turnover was surprisingly unchanged. Activated T cells in vitro produce thymidine and mice with T cell leukemia display elevated serum thymidine, nominating T lymphocytes as the source of thymidine in LCMV infection. In sum, we provide comprehensive measurements of whole-body and tissue metabolism in acute and chronic viral infection, and identify altered thymidine metabolism as a marker of viral infection.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is characterized by excessive inflammation leading to the development of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) derived from ω6 and ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are central to the regulation of inflammation, controlling both its initiation and resolution. Still, their role in COVID-19 remains underexplored. By employing a holistic approach involving the analysis of white blood cell transcriptomes, targeted lipidomics, cytokine and immune cell profiling, across the spectrum of disease severity groups, including mild non-hospitalized patients and healthy individuals, we now show that LM networks are profoundly altered in COVID-19, correlate with inflammatory patterns, and stratify patients according to disease severity. Central to this are CYP450-derived LMs such as 20-HETE, lipid peroxidation metabolites such as iPF2a-VI, and lipoxygenase-derived LMs such as 12-HETE, all of which are major vasoactive mediators of inflammation. Among them, 20-HETE appears to be a promising prognostic biomarker for ICU admission and a potential therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 disease. Our study thus underscores the significance of LM networks in COVID-19 pathophysiology and sheds light into the broader mechanisms driving viral pneumonia in humans.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses are a genus of small RNA viruses that are responsible for approximately one billion global infections annually. These infections range in severity from the common cold and flu-like symptoms to more severe diseases, such as viral myocarditis, pancreatitis, and neurological disorders, that continue to pose a global health challenge with limited therapeutic strategies currently available. In the current study, we sought to understand the interaction between coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which is a model enterovirus, and macrophage cells, as there is limited understanding of how this virus interacts with macrophage innate immune cells. Our study demonstrated that CVB3 can robustly activate macrophages without apparent viral replication in these cells. We also showed that myeloid cells lacked the viral entry receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, the expression of exogenous CAR in RAW264.7 macrophages was unable to overcome the viral replication deficit. Interestingly, the CAR expression was associated with altered inflammatory responses during prolonged infection. Additionally, we identified the autophagy protein LC3 as a novel stimulus for macrophage activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CVB3-induced macrophage activation and its implications for viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="IL-23 signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases, yet the cellular targets and signaling pathways affected by this cytokine remain poorly understood. We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (CVOID-19) has varied clinical manifestations including mild to severe acute respiratory symptoms. Inflammasome complex and mitochondria play an important role in initiating inflammatory responses and could potentially be affected by this infection. To study the inflammasome and mitochondrial fission and fusion gene expression levels in COVID-19 patients, we designed this experiment. 
The inflammasome and mitochondrial gene expression profiles were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the peripheral blood of 70 hospitalized CVOID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms (HOSP) and 30 ICU patients with severe symptoms (ICU) compared to 20 healthy controls (HC). 
The results indicated that the expression of the dynamin-related protein-1 was extremely suppressed in HOSP while it came back to the normal range in the ICU group. However, the expression of fission 1 protein had a non-significant increase in HOSP and a decrease in the ICU group. The mitofusin-1 and dominant optic atrophy genes showed high expression levels (10-fold) and (70-fold), respectively, in the HOSP group. However, mitofusin-2 significantly decreased in both groups. Although leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 (NLRP3) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activating and recruitment domain genes dramatically increased in both groups (10 and 4-fold), other inflammasome genes declined in both groups. Finally, Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activate d B cells (NF-κB) extremely decreased, and Intreleukine-1 showed high expression in ICU patients (3-fold). 
CVOID-19 infection suppresses the fission genes and elevates the fusion gene expression in mitochondria, and it can cause activation of the inflammasome via the NLRP3 pathway.">

        <tr id="Significance Virus–host interactions can vary widely, with some host cell types resisting virus entry or replication, and others supporting a full viral replication cycle. Such interactions have not been easy to characterize in vivo, particularly for infections of the central nervous system (CNS). We developed a dual-labeling virus with the capability of distinguishing abortive or productive viral replication in vivo. We used this virus to examine the response of different CNS cell types to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. Additionally, we were able to uncover early host responses and assess their impact on primary infection. Investigation of other virus–host interactions can use this dual labeling strategy to better track the dynamics and specificity of virus–host interactions.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors are frequently observed to present persistent symptoms constituting what has been called “post-acute COVID-19 syndrome” (PACS) or “long COVID-19”. Some clinical risk factors have been identified to be associated with PACS development; however, specific mechanisms responsible for PACS pathology remain unknown. This study investigates clinical, immunological, and metabolomic risk factors associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) in 51 patients, assessed 7–19 months after acute infection. Among the participants, 62.7% were male and 37.2% were female, with an average age of 47.8 years. At the follow-up, 37.2% met the criteria for PACS, revealing significant differences in immunological and metabolomic profiles at the time of acute infection. Patients with PACS were characterized by elevated levels of mature low-density granulocytes (LDGs), interleukin-8 (IL-8), pyruvate, pseudouridine, and cystine. Baseline multivariate analysis showed increased pyruvate and decreased alpha tocopherol levels. At follow-up, there was a decrease in absolute B lymphocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid levels. These findings suggest that specific immunological and metabolomic markers during acute infection can help identify patients at higher risk of developing persistent PACS.">

        <tr id="Epithelial injury calls for a regenerative response from a coordinated network of epithelial stem cells and immune cells. Defining this network is key to preserving the repair process for acute resolution, but also for preventing a remodeling process with chronic dysfunction. We recently identified an immune niche for basal-epithelial stem cells using mouse models of injury after respiratory viral infection. Niche function depended on an early sentinel population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) that provided ligand GPNMB to basal-ESC receptor CD44 for reprogramming towards chronic lung disease. These same cell and molecular control points worked directly in mouse and human basal-ESC organoids, but the findings were not yet validated in vivo in human disease. Further, persistence of GPNMB expression in moDCs and M2-macrophages in mouse models suggested utility as a long-term disease biomarker in humans. Here we show increased expression of GPNMB localized to moDC-macrophage populations in lung tissue samples from long-term Covid, asthma, and COPD. The findings thereby provide initial evidence of a persistent and correctable pathway from acute injury to chronic disease with implications for cellular reprogramming and inflammatory memory.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease and is widespread over the world. This disease shows a 5.1% mortality. The understanding of the disease has expanded rapidly in many areas, including virological, epidemiological, clinical, and management dimensions. To better understand the inflammatory and immune profiles that impact the pathogenesis and development of severe COVID-19 symptoms, further studies are essential. This research aims to explore the inflammatory and adaptive immune responses associated with COVID-19, considering factors such as genetic diversity and environmental exposure among Saudi patients. The goal is to determine if patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit different disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: This case-control study includes 115 participants (healthy and with COVID-19 infection), 55 of which had confirmed cases of COVID-19 in intensive care units (ICUs) at different hospitals in Makkah City, Saudi Arabia. Whole blood samples were collected from June to September 2021 for cellular analyses, and inflammation marker data were collected from hospital records. The expression of activation markers on B (CD27 and CD38) and T cells (CD27 and HLA-DR) was obtained using the flow cytometry technique. Also, serum was collected for cytokine measurements, including IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF- α. Results: The results indicated that lymphopenia and excessive T cell activation were more prevalent in severe cases than in healthy individuals. Furthermore, the results revealed that severe COVID-19 patients had an increased frequency of CD19+ B cells, with changes in B cell subsets. The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers with pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers in severe COVID-19 cases, which could be targeted for therapeutic interventions. This might be a valuable approach for the diagnosis and treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.">

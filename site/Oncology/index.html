        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Myocarditis, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, can have multiple etiologies, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or, rarely, mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on left ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from patients with myocarditis unrelated to COVID-19 (Non-COVID-19), after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Post-COVID-19) and after COVID-19 vaccination (Post-Vaccination). We identified distinct cytokine expression patterns, with interferon-γ playing a key role in Post-COVID-19, and upregulated IL16 and IL18 expression serving as a hallmark of Post-Vaccination myocarditis. Although myeloid responses were similar across all groups, the Post-Vaccination group showed a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells, and the Post-COVID-19 group exhibited an expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T and natural killer cells. Endothelial cells showed gene expression changes indicative of vascular barrier dysfunction in the Post-COVID-19 group and ongoing angiogenesis across all groups. These findings highlight shared and distinct mechanisms driving myocarditis in patients with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T-cells are essential for controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet their antigen-specific resolution in relation to disease severity, functional dynamics during acute infection, and long-term memory formation remain incompletely understood. Using comprehensive longitudinal profiling of 553 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic antigens across globally prevalent HLAs, we identified antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses that were either critical for early viral clearance or associated with severe disease outcomes. During acute infection, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a broader and more robust CD8+ T-cell response than those with mild disease. Notably, we identified HLA-A1-restricted immunodominant antigen-specific T-cells strongly associated with severe disease. These T-cells were present at extremely high frequencies but showed significantly reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules at both the transcriptomic (PRF1, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY) and protein levels (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2), as revealed by multidimensional single-cell and cytokine profiling. In contrast, patients with mild disease had T-cells that recognized a more restricted set of antigens, showed only partial overlap with those in severe cases, and showed enhanced cytotoxicity, along with enrichment in gene sets associated with cytotoxic function, hypoxia, and glycolysis. Furthermore, the long-term memory CD8+ T-cells were maintained for a limited subset of immunodominant antigens, with their persistence correlating with their initial frequency during infection. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following infection expanded the long-term T-cell repertoire by enhancing pre-existing responses and generating de novo responses, regardless of prior disease severity. These findings resolve the antigen-specific kinetics and durability of CD8+ T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide key insights into their functional landscape. This knowledge could inform future vaccine strategies and therapeutic interventions to enhance protective immunity against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="Background The durability of vaccine-induced immune memory to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial for preventing infection, especially severe disease. Methods This follow-up report from a phase 1/2 study of S-268019-b (a recombinant spike protein vaccine) after homologous booster vaccination confirms its long-term safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. Results Booster vaccination with S-268019-b resulted in an enhancement of serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers and a broad range of viral neutralization. Single-cell immune profiling revealed persistent and mature antigen-specific memory B cells and T follicular helper cells, with increased B-cell receptor diversity. The expansion of B- and T-cell repertoires and presence of cross-reactive NAbs targeting conserved epitopes within the receptor-binding domain following a booster accounted for the broad-spectrum neutralizing activity. Conclusion These findings highlight the potential of S-268019-b to provide broad and robust protection against a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants, addressing a critical challenge in the ongoing fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).">

        <tr id="Background : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains a public health challenge worldwide. The gastrointestinal tract has emerged as an important site of infection and has been implicated as a reservoir for long-term infection, particularly for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. However, whether vaccine-induced systemic antibodies can prevent intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Compared to Vero cells commonly used to assess SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, the intestinal epithelium has a functional interferon response and expresses higher levels of ACE2, enzymes, and antibody-binding Fc receptors that may impact SARS-CoV-2 immune elimination. Methods : We evaluated the potential of antibodies from both naturally infected and vaccinated human subjects to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of the intestinal epithelium. Serum samples were collected from human volunteers who had undergone natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 (n=5) or who had received the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (n=13). Banked sera collected in 2016 served as negative controls (n=2). SARS-CoV-2 (WA01, Delta or Omicron) was pre-treated with sera and then used to infect iPSC-derived human intestinal organoids (HIO) or Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was quantified by plaque assay, PCR, or immunofluorescence (IF) after 48-96 h. Results: Both HIOs and Caco-2 cells supported robust infection with SARS-CoV-2. In HIOs, pretreatment of SARS-CoV-2 with a high titer post-vaccine serum completely blocked replication of WA01. Similarly, sera from both naturally infected donors collected in 2020 and sera from individuals who had received a BNT162b2 vaccine significantly inhibited replication of the WA01 strain in Caco-2 cells. In contrast, none of the sera significantly inhibited infection with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. For Omicron, only sera from individuals who had received an Omicron-based vaccine significantly inhibited infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the plaque assay. Across all virus types, sera from individuals who had received Omicron-based BNT162b2 boosters were the most effective at reducing infection in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that vaccine-induced antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective in the gut. Our study also supports previous reports indicating that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines need to be adapted to circulating virus strains to convey full protection from infection.">

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak revealed the susceptibility of elderly patients to respiratory virus infections, showing cell senescence or subclinical persistent inflammatory profiles and favoring the development of severe pneumonia. Methods In our study, we evaluated the potential influence of lung aging on the efficiency of replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as determining the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of the distal lung tissue. Results Using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from donors of different ages, we found that pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 IAV replicated in the lung parenchyma with high efficacy. In contrast to these IAV strains, SARS-CoV-2 Early isolate and Delta variant of concern (VOC) replicated less efficiently in PCLS. Interestingly, both viruses showed reduced replication in PCLS from older compared to younger donors, suggesting that aged lung tissue represents a suboptimal environment for viral replication. Regardless of the age-dependent viral loads, PCLS responded to H5N1 IAV infection by an induction of IL-6 and IP10/CXCL10, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and to H1N1 IAV infection by induction of IP10/CXCL10 mRNA. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 IAV infection were not causing detectable cell death, H5N1 IAV infection led to more cytotoxicity and induced significant early interferon responses. Conclusions In summary, our findings suggest that aged lung tissue might not favor viral dissemination, pointing to a determinant role of dysregulated immune mechanisms in the development of severe disease.

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses are the most common cause of infectious encephalitis and highly target neurons for infection. Our understanding of the intrinsic capacity of neuronal innate immune responses to mediate protective antiviral responses remains incomplete. Here, we evaluated the role of intercellular crosstalk in mediating intrinsic neuronal immunity and its contribution to limiting viral infection. We found that in the absence of viral antagonism, neurons transcriptionally induce robust interferon signaling and can effectively signal to uninfected bystander neurons. Yet, in two-dimensional cultures, this dynamic response did not restrict viral spread. Interestingly, this differed in the context of viral infection in three-dimensional forebrain organoids with complex neuronal subtypes and cellular organization, where we observed protective capacity. We showed antiviral crosstalk between infected neurons and bystander neural progenitors is mediated by type I interferon signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we then uncovered regions containing bystander neural progenitors that expressed distinct antiviral genes, revealing critical underpinnings of protective antiviral responses among neuronal subtypes. These findings underscore the importance of interneuronal communication in protective antiviral immunity in the brain and implicate key contributions to protective antiviral signaling.

        <tr id="Common neurological symptoms of COVID-19, such as anosmia, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction, depend on interactions between the peripheral and central nervous systems. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections. Highlights iPSC technology was employed to generate peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a valuable platform for studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on peripheral sensory neurons. Our findings demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant exerted both direct and indirect effects on peripheral sensory neurons. Virus exposure upregulated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in peripherin-positive neurons. Additionally, exposure to the virus or its S1 spike protein increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression and trafficking, leading to axonal degeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that BA.5 exposure enhanced cAMP signaling pathway, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels that led to the significantly damage on synapses and axon guidance. The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited TRPV1 activation and mitigated axonal damage, offering neuroprotective effects for sensory neurons exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Age is among the strongest risk factors for severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we describe upper respiratory tract (URT) and peripheral blood transcriptomes of 202 participants (age range of 1 week to 83 years), including 137 non-hospitalized individuals with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and 65 healthy individuals. Among healthy children and adolescents, younger age is associated with higher URT expression of innate and adaptive immune pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces broad upregulation of URT innate and adaptive immune responses among children and adolescents. Peripheral blood responses among SARS-CoV-2-infected children and adolescents are dominated by interferon pathways, while upregulation of myeloid activation, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways is observed only in adults. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, fever is associated with blunted URT immune responses and more pronounced systemic immune activation. These findings demonstrate that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 differ across the lifespan, from distinct signatures in childhood and adolescence to age-associated alterations in adults.">

We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in relation to antibodies, infection outcome and disease severity and assessed its durability in a longitudinal cohort over a three-year time course. We identified pre-existing T cells reactive to the seasonal coronavirus (CoV) OC43 that cross-react with the conserved SARS-CoV-2 spike S813-829 peptide. These cross-reactive T cells increased in frequency following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and correlated with enhanced spike-specific T cell responses and significantly reduced viral loads. Furthermore, our data revealed that CoV-cross-reactive T cells were maintained as part of the long-lasting memory response, contributing to increased T cell frequencies against omicron variants.

        <tr id="Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, can cause neurological symptoms, but the underlying neurotropic mechanisms are unclear. Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.258.17, B.1.1.7, and BA.5.3.2 (termed wild-type, alpha and omicron, respectively) revealed that human astrocytes, not neurons, support viral proliferation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics. In summary, human astrocytes, but not neurons, contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, highlighting the potential benefits of ketamine treatment in coronavirus infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT A major challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been assessing the intensity, dynamics, and determinants of the antibody responses after infection and/or vaccination. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody responses among naturally infected individuals and individuals who achieved hybrid immunity in a large Canadian cohort. We demonstrate that anti-Spike IgGs and neutralizing antibody dynamics vary greatly among individuals with COVID-19, in peak antibody levels, rate of waning, and longevity of the antibody response. Additionally, we found an association between robust antibody responses and individuals with severe COVID-19 clinical symptoms during the first-month post-symptom onset. For individuals who achieved hybrid immunity, a robust increase in anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibodies followed the first vaccination dose; however, there was a minimal increase in the anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibody titers after administration of the second dose of the vaccine. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies elicited by the wild-type virus alone were largely ineffective against emerging variants of concern in our natural infection-only cohort, in contrast to a much broader and more robust neutralization profile observed in individuals who achieved hybrid immunity. Our findings emphasize the need for global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts to further sustain protective immune responses required to minimize viral spread and disease severity in the population. As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, understanding the interplay between previous infections, vaccine durability, and virus evolution will be critical for guiding ongoing vaccination strategies. IMPORTANCE A major challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been assessing the intensity, dynamics, and determinants of the antibody response after infection and/or vaccination. Our paper addresses this in a large Canadian cohort with antibody responses that were generated by natural infection as well as vaccine in some persons studied.">

Both groups of K18-ACE2 mice were intranasally infected with 500 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with analyses performed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infection (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, lung RNA-seq, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable differences, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance, reduced survival, and failure to recover weight loss due to infection. RNA-seq data suggested greater lung damage and reduced respiratory function in infected aged mice. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient antiviral response characterized by reduced Th1-associated mediators (IFNγ, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9) and diminished number of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. These findings indicate that aging affects antiviral immunity, leading to prolonged infection, greater lung damage, and poorer clinical outcomes. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.

        <tr id="Viral replication in endothelial cells is a hallmark of many viral diseases in humans and other animals, underscoring the importance of understanding cellular mechanisms that restrict viral replication and the associated consequences for vascular health. Pathogenic variants of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV, Isavirus salaris) target endothelial cells of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), causing severe systemic disease and major losses during outbreaks in aquaculture. To better understand the endothelial response to ISAV, we used single nucleus RNA-sequencing at pre-clinical (12 days post infection, dpi) and clinical (16 dpi) stages of infection. Our approach enables an assessment of transcriptomic responses for different endothelial subpopulations at unprecedented resolution. ISAV RNA was predominantly detected in endothelial cells, which, along with mononuclear phagocytes, showed the highest number of differentially regulated genes at both time points. At 12 dpi, differentially expressed genes in endothelial cells were enriched for pathways related to NOD-like receptor signaling, antiviral responses, and regulation of programmed cell death. By 16 dpi, we observed a shift toward enrichment of pathways associated with cellular senescence, apelin signaling, and insulin signaling. We identified two distinct infection-related states at both time points: a virus-permissive state characterized by upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, small GTPase signaling, and MAPK activity, and a bystander phenotype marked by activation of antiviral responses, immune signaling, and translational regulation. This study is the first to capture the individual cell type responses to ISAV infection, and to characterize the in vivo endothelial response to active viral replication at single-cell resolution in any species.">

However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

Here, we present high-resolution spatial transcriptomics of 40 postmortem brain samples from patients with Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and severe COVID-19. Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer-and region-specificity. In Parkinson’s disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance. COVID-19 brains displayed extensive peripheral immune cell infiltration, particularly in the subcortical white matter, accompanied by compromised blood-brain barrier and coordinated neuroinflammatory responses from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Integration of miRNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics uncovered layer-specific regulatory patterns, including neuroinflammation-associated miR-155.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is characterized by cytokine storm and organ dysfunction. The spike S1 subunit induces inflammatory cytokine production, but the immune cell subsets that respond to S1 stimulation and contribute to disease severity remain unclear. Methods We analyzed serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 (moderate: n = 7; severe: n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 38). Using mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight; CyTOF), we analyzed immune cell responses to S1 subunit stimulation in PBMCs from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19. We examined correlations among identified cell populations, serum cytokine levels, and clinical parameters. Results Serum S1 subunit levels correlated with disease severity and inflammatory cytokine concentrations. S1 subunit stimulation induced dose-dependent cytokine production from PBMCs, predominantly from myeloid cells. CyTOF analysis identified classical monocytes with high CD147 expression (CD147hi cMono) as the primary source of S1-induced cytokines. The proportion of CD147hi cMono increased significantly in severe COVID-19 and decreased with clinical improvement. The frequency of CD147hi cMono showed a stronger positive correlation with clinical severity markers in younger patients compared to older patients. Conclusions CD147hi cMono are the primary cellular source of S1-induced inflammatory cytokines and may serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring COVID-19 severity and treatment response.

        <tr id="Abstract People living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, including prolonged viral shedding and emergence of mutations. To investigate the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, seven SIV+ rhesus macaques were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 in all macaques was mild. SARS-CoV-2 replication persisted in the upper, but not the lower respiratory tract for 14 days post-infection. Animals showed impaired generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cells. Animals also displayed transient changes in microbial communities in the upper airway and gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 evolution was observed in the upper respiratory tract. This study demonstrates that SIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in rhesus macaques recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in PLWH. We show that SIV impairs anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, potentially leading to prolonged viral shedding, altered pathogenesis, and viral evolution. This highlights the importance of HIV status in COVID-19 and supports the use of this model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism implicated in cardiac infection in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible.">

Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1–/– mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1–/– animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng–/– mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1–/– animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality, especially in COVID-19 patients, due to delayed diagnosis and limited therapeutic options. While the mechanisms of programmed cell death (PCD) in COVID-19 and sepsis are complex, understanding the molecular markers involved in these processes may aid in assessing disease severity. This study aimed to investigate the roles of PCD markers, inflammatory cytokines, and MHC molecules in distinguishing disease severity in COVID-19 patients with and without sepsis. Methods The study involved adult patients (≥18 years) who survived COVID-19, grouped into four cohorts: COVID-19 with sepsis (C19wSepsis), COVID-19 without sepsis (C19NoSepsis), sepsis alone, and healthy controls. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each cohort were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. PCD markers (caspase-3, caspase-1, MLKL, LC3B, p62/SQSTM1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma), and MHC molecules (MHC I-A, MHC II-DRB1) were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate differences in marker levels between and within cohorts. Results The analysis identified two distinct molecular signatures associated with disease severity. The first signature, characterized by elevated levels of secreted markers of PCD, IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma, MHC I-A and MHC II-DRB1, was common to the C19wSepsis and C19NoSepsis cohorts. The second signature, which was more prominent in the cellular markers of PCD (caspase-1, caspase-3, MLKL, p62/SQSTM1), was uniquely associated with the C19wSepsis cohort. Conclusion These findings provide insight into the molecular signatures distinguishing immune responses in COVID-19-related sepsis and may serve as valuable biomarkers for assessing disease severity, while guiding therapeutic interventions in critical care settings.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells remains very limited. The contributions of intracellular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also unclear. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for IGFBP2, specifically in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2), in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we show that IGFBP2 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in primary AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions from patients with COVID-19-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alone or IPF with a history of COVID-19. Using multicolor immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 and its selective ligands IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly reduced in AEC2 cells from patients with COVID-ARDS, IPF alone, or IPF with COVID history than in those from age-matched donor controls. Further, we demonstrated that lentiviral expression of Igfbp2 significantly reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines—Tnf-α, Il1β, Il6, Stat3, Stat6 and chemokine receptors—Ccr2 and Ccr5—in mouse lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injury (S2; 500 ng/mL). Finally, we demonstrated higher levels of cytokines—TNF-α; IL-6 and chemokine receptor—CCR5 in AEC2 cells from COVID-ARDS patients compared to the IPF alone and the IPF with COVID history patients. Altogether, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IGFBP2 in AEC2 cells and its localized delivery may serve as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with COVID-19.

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have emerged. Although the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the lungs, it can also affect the brain and induce neurological symptoms. However, the specific effects of different variants on the brain remain unclear. In this study, a whole-transcriptome analysis was conducted using the brain tissues of K18-hACE2 mice infected with the ancestral B.1 (Wuhan) variant and with major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.529 (Omicron). After sequencing, differential gene expression, gene ontology (GO) and genome pathway enrichment analyses were performed. An Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) was used to identify the abundance of different cell populations. Additionally, RT-qPCR was used to validate the RNA-seq data. The viral load and hierarchical clustering analyses divided the samples into two different clusters with notable differences in gene expression at day 6 post-infection for all variants compared to the control group. GO and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analyses revealed similar patterns of pathway enrichment for different variants. ImmuCellAI revealed the changes in immune cell populations, including the decrease in CD4+ T and B cell proportions and the increase in CD8+ T and dendritic cell proportions. A co-expression network analysis revealed that some genes, such as STAT1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), were dysregulated in all variants. A RT-qPCR analysis for IL-6, CXCL10 and IRF7 further validated the RNA-seq analysis. In conclusion, this study provides, for the first time, an extensive transcriptome analysis of a K18-hACE2 mouse brain after infection with major SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="Objective Both B-cell- and T-cell-mediated immunity are crucial for the effective clearance of viral infection, but little is known about the dynamic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in people living with HIV (PLWH) after a full course of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Methods In this study, fifty people living with HIV (PLWH) and thirty healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled to assess B-cell and T-cell responses at the day before the vaccination (T0), two weeks after the first dose (T1), two months after the first dose (T2), the day of the third dose (T3), one month after the third dose (T4), three months after the third dose (T5) and 12 months (T6) after the third dose. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses were induced in people living with HIV (PLWH), and these responses lasted at least one year after the third vaccine dose. However, the peak frequencies of Spike-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in PLWH were lower than those in HIV-negative controls. In addition, the expansion of activated B cells, memory B cells and plasma cells after primary vaccination was observed, but the percentages of these cells were decreased at T6 and were comparable to those at T0. Additionally, the percentages of activated T cells, exhausted T cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with enhanced functional activity were increased following the administration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, PLWH had lower percentages of plasma cells, RBD-specific B cells, circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells and CD38+ cTfh cells, and the percentages of the latter two types of cells were positively correlated with the titer of neutralizing antibodies, indicating these differences may account for the weaker immune responses induced in PLWH. Conclusion These data suggest that specific B-cell and T-cell responses could be sustained for at least one year after receiving the third vaccination. Our findings emphasize that the weak SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses induced in PLWH have implications for clinical decision-making and public health policy for PLWH with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Dengue is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions globally and imposes a considerable disease burden. Annually, dengue virus (DENV) causes up to 400 million infections, of which approximately 25% present with clinical manifestations ranging from mild to fatal. Despite its significance as a growing public health concern, developing effective DENV vaccines has been challenging. One reason is the lack of comprehensive understanding of the influence exerted by prior DENV infections and immune responses with cross-reactive properties. To investigate this, we collected samples from a pediatric cohort study in dengue-endemic Managua, Nicaragua. We characterized T cell responses in 71 healthy children who had previously experienced 1 or more natural DENV infections and who, within 1 year after sample collection, had a subsequent DENV infection that was either symptomatic or inapparent. Our study investigated the effect of preexisting DENV-specific T cell responses on clinical outcomes of subsequent DENV infection. We assessed DENV-specific T cell responses using an activation-induced marker assay. Children with only 1 prior DENV infection displayed heterogeneous DENV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies. In contrast, children with 2 or more prior DENV infections showed significantly higher DENV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies associated with inapparent rather than symptomatic outcomes in subsequent infection. These findings demonstrate the protective role of DENV-specific T cells against symptomatic DENV infection and advance efforts to identify protective immune correlates against dengue.">

        <tr id="Background Pregnant women are considered a high-risk population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as the virus can infect the placenta and embryos. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been widely reported to cause retinal pathological changes and to infect the embryonic retina. The infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is primarily mediated through spike (S) protein, which also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, it remains poorly understood how the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 affects retinal development, and the underlying mechanism has not yet been clarified. Methods We used human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids (hEROs) as a model to study the effect of S protein exposure at different stages of retinal development. hEROs were treated with 2 μg/mL of S protein on days 90 and 280. Immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR were performed to assess the influence of S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages. Results The results showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the receptors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, were expressed in hEROs. Exposure to the S protein induced an inflammatory response in both the early and late stages of retinal development in the hEROs. Additionally, RNA sequencing indicated that early exposure of the S protein to hEROs affected nuclear components and lipid metabolism, while late-stages exposure resulted in changes to cell membrane components and the extracellular matrix. Conclusion This work highlights the differential effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced developmental impairments in the human retina.

        <tr id="Introduction Porcine Circovirus (PCV2) infection is prevalent in pig farming and causes significant economic losses. In recent years, the PCV2d subtype has become the most prevalent genotype worldwide, exhibiting higher virulence, leading to more severe viremia and organ damage. Therefore, studying the biological characteristics of the PCV2d subtype is of great significance. Methods We established a PCV2d infection model using BALB/c mice and employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to systematically analyze the transcriptome of 10 cell types in the lung tissues of infected mice. We developed a comprehensive marker gene catalog for these cell types. Results Compared to uninfected mice, PCV2d infection induced extensive viral replication and immunosuppressive responses in most cell types. Monocyte macrophages with high levels of viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and various cell population interactions occurring through CD40-CD40L and CXCL14-CXCR4 were identified. These cells predominantly mediate antigen presentation and processing pathways in vivo, contributing to PCV2d-driven inflammatory lung injury. Discussion Our data uncovered a complex unique immune response scenario in the lung tissue of mice after PCV2d infection, deciphering the potential mechanisms underlying PCV2d-driven inflammatory responses in mice. Furthermore, this study provides a rich database for the molecular basis of different cell types' responses to PCV2d infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has highlighted the critical importance of understanding protective long-lasting immune responses. This study investigates the epitope specificity, T cell receptor (TCR) usage, and phenotypic changes in SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells over time in convalescent individuals with COVID-19. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 28 unvaccinated individuals with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (6 identified as the D614G variant, clade 20C) and analyzed up to 12 months post-symptom onset. Antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) using specific dextramer and antibody reagents. TCR clonotypes and activation markers were characterized to explore T cell dynamics. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited waning frequencies long-term, transitioning from memory-like to a naïve-like state. scRNAseq revealed specificity against both spike and non-spike antigens with increased CD95 and CD127 expression over time, indicating that naïve-like T cells may represent stem cell memory T cells, which are multipotent and self-renewing, likely important for long-lived immunity. TCR clonal expansion was observed mainly in memory T cells, with overlapping TCR beta chain (TRB)-complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences between participants, suggesting shared public TCR epitope-specific repertoires against SARS-CoV-2. Further, unique spike-specific CD4+ T cells with high CD95 and CD127 expression were identified, which may play a crucial role in long-term protection. Discussion This study highlights epitope-specificity heterogeneity, with some immunodominant responses, and suggests a potential role for long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. Shared TCR repertoires offers insights into cross-reactive and protective T cell clones, providing valuable information for optimizing vaccine strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings underscore the critical role of cellular immunity in long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and emphasizes the importance of understanding T cell dynamics.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chikungunya (CHIKV) and dengue (DENV) are mosquito-borne viruses that cause severe epidemics, often in remote regions. A limitation to our understanding of these pathogens is the difficulty of performing assays of the cellular immune response. To fill this gap, we developed a novel miniaturized automated system capable of processing 250 μl of whole blood for high-throughput cellular analysis. In a field study with a pediatric cohort in Msambweni, Kenya, known for previous exposure to CHIKV and/or DENV, we processed 133 whole blood samples using our system under three conditions: no stimulation, and stimulation with CHIKV or DENV peptide pools. These samples underwent CyTOF or flow cytometry analysis to evaluate virus-specific memory T cell responses and phenotypes. CyTOF analysis of 81 participant samples revealed significant cytokine responses to CHIKV and DENV, particularly IFNγ (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and TNF-α (P < 0.0001) by γδ T cells. Additionally, a significant TNF-α response was observed in the CD8+ TEMRA memory subset to DENV, albeit to a lesser degree than in γδ T cells. To confirm our CyTOF findings, we employed flow cytometry on the remaining 40 samples using a targeted panel, validating significant TNF-α (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01) and IFN-γ (P < 0.05) responses by γδ T cells to CHIKV and DENV, respectively. Our study demonstrates that our innovative automated system enables detailed assessment of immune function, particularly beneficial in pediatric populations and resource-limited settings with limited sample volumes. This approach holds promise for advancing our understanding of cellular immune responses to various viral and infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life [1]. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells, and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV infected and bystander activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing. Importance Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and functional genomics to understand the host response in both RSV infected and bystander cells, identify what host factors mediate infection, and contextualize these findings relative to dozens of previously reported screens across 17 additional viruses.">

        <tr id="Background Variant-adapted vaccines are recommended in vulnerable populations to address the waning immunity and the emergence of immune-escaping SARS-CoV-2 variants, yet data about immune responses to such vaccines in people living with HIV (PLWH) are limited. We therefore aimed to assess long-term immune responses to an original–BA.4/5 mRNA booster in this population. Methods In this prospective longitudinal study, PLWH receiving either an original–BA.4/5 bivalent booster or an original monovalent booster and HIV-negative healthcare workers (HCWs) receiving a bivalent booster were enrolled and sampled before (T0), 1 month (T1), and 4–9 months (T2) after the vaccine administration. SARS-CoV-2–specific T and B cells, RBD-binding antibodies, and RBD-blocking antibodies against both wild type (WT) and omicron BA.4/5 virus were determined. Results The bivalent booster is able to transiently increase both humoral and polyfunctional T cell responses in PLWH, with humoral responses comparable to those observed in HCWs. While T cell responses are cross-reactive against viral variants and stable over time, humoral immunity is imprinted to the ancestral virus and wanes quickly. Furthermore, whilst previous SARS-CoV-2 infection does not affect the trajectory of vaccine-elicited immune responses, markers of HIV-related T cell dysfunction are associated with lower antibody peak responses and higher antibody waning. Lastly, the bivalent booster was superior to the monovalent one in inducing BA.4/5-reactive RBD-blocking antibodies. Conclusions The original–BA.4/5 bivalent booster is highly immunogenic in PLWH and superior to the monovalent one in inducing humoral responses against the BA.4/5 virus, although HIV-related T cell dysfunction markers are associated with blunted and less durable antibody immunity.">

        <tr id="Primary immunity against Zika virus (ZIKV) increases the risk of a subsequent severe dengue virus 2 (DENV2) infection, presenting a significant challenge for developing safe and effective ZIKV vaccines. However, the mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain unclear. We show that post-ZIKV infection IgA antibodies in serum targeting the DENV2 nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) drive neutrophil activation and correlate with increased risk of a subsequent severe DENV2 infection in a pediatric cohort study. Increased neutrophil degranulation correlated with IgA binding to DENV2 NS1 and preceded vascular leakage in paired acute-phase samples from the same individuals and in dengue patients after prior ZIKV infection in an orthogonal hospital-based study. Thus, serum anti-NS1 IgA enhances neutrophil activation in severe dengue, with implications for prognostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Background The mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after non-severe COVID-19 remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood cells of patients with post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) and assess if distinct clinical subtypes with specific gene signatures could be identified. Methods The cohort included 111 PCC patients from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant era, with 57 recovered (Recov) and 54 having prolonged symptoms indicative of PCC. The results were compared to 63 healthy controls (Ctrl) without known SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data included patient assessments, laboratory results, comorbidities, and questionnaires on quality of life and functioning. Transcriptomic analysis and cellular deconvolution methods were used on total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results PCC patients had more comorbidities (mean 1.3) and more frequently (59%) at least one comorbidity than recovered patients (31%) and controls (24%). Overall, past COVID-19 illness or current PCC symptoms caused minimal changes in the blood cell transcriptome, with only 3–6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified across comparisons. However, a subset of male PCC patients exhibited an increased fraction of deconvoluted erythroblasts and significant genome-wide gene expression changes, with 399 DEGs compared to recovered and control males. These genes were enriched in pathways related to heme metabolism and gas exchange in erythrocytes. Conclusions Persistent symptoms in PCC are multifactorial and not directly linked to peripheral blood cell gene expression changes. However, a subgroup of male PCC patients shows distinct erythrocyte responses that may contribute to long-term symptoms.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID‐19 commonly leads to respiratory issues, yet numerous patients also exhibit a diverse range of neurological conditions, suggesting a detrimental impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 or the viral Spike protein on the central nervous system. Nonetheless, the molecular pathway behind neurological pathology and the presumed neurotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains largely unexplored. We generated human cortical organoids (HCOs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to assess: (1) the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 main entry factors; (2) their vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; and (3) the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to the Spike protein on their transcriptome. Results proved that (1) HCOs express the main SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors and co‐receptors; (2) HCOs may be productively infected by SARS‐CoV‐2; (3) the viral particles released by SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected HCOs are able to re‐infect another cellular line; and (4) the infection resulted in the activation of apoptotic and stress pathways, along with inflammatory processes. Notably, these effects were recapitulated when HCOs were exposed to the Spike protein alone. The data obtained demonstrate that SARS‐CoV‐2 likely infects HCOs probably through the binding of ACE2, CD147, and NRP1 entry factors. Furthermore, exposure to the Spike protein alone proved sufficient to disrupt their homeostasis and induce neurotoxic effects, potentially contributing to the onset of long‐COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="Background Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome predominantly affecting children, with a propensity to induce coronary artery lesions. Aberrant immune activation and cytokines cascade reactions are involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in immune cell communication during the course of KD and to identify potential biomarkers. Methods The study enrolled seven pediatric patients diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease (KD) between December 2019 and December 2021. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was utilized to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Bioinformatics methods including quality control, dimensionality reduction, cell annotation, differential expression analysis, cell communication analysis, and co-expression network analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. Results This study utilized single-cell sequencing technology to uncover the dynamics of immune cell communication during the course of KD, revealing a significant increase in the number of CD14+ monocytes in the early stages of vasculitis, which play a central role in cell-cell communication. SELPLG was identified as a particularly crucial gene in the signal transduction among immune cells. The study also observed various cellular communication patterns of vasculitis at different time points and identified co-expression modules related to ribosomal function, cell proliferation, and immune responses in CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD16+ monocytes. Notably, the expression of the ITK gene in CD14+ monocytes stood out. Furthermore, MHC-I genes were the most active molecules involved in signal transduction, and the expression of CD40 genes increased with the prolongation of vasculitis duration. Conclusion CD14+ monocytes play a pivotal role in cellular communication during the activation process of KD vasculitis, with SELPLG and ITK as important communication signal genes. These findings provide a novel perspective for the discovery of biomarkers, prediction of disease progression, and the development of targeted treatment strategies for KD.

        <tr id="Background The T cell compartment undergoes significant age-related changes, contributing to the decline of the adaptive immune system and increasing the risk of suboptimal antibody responses to vaccines in older adults. To better understand the association between T cell phenotypes and vaccine responsiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of CD4+, CD8+, and γδ + T cells on VITAL cohort participants who are low or high responders to multiple vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and SARS-CoV-2). Results Using spectral cytometry and FlowSOM, we identified detailed phenotypes of naïve, regulatory, and terminally differentiated T cells. We observed that the percentages of CD31 + naïve CD4+, CD31 + naïve CD8+, and CD38 + naïve CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in low vaccine responders. Notably, CD31 + naïve T cell subsets showed a stronger correlation with immune entropy, a measure of cumulative immune system perturbations, than with age itself. Conclusions These findings suggest that subsets of naïve cells could be associated with weak vaccine responsiveness and immunosenescence. Furthermore, these naive T cell signatures could help predict weak vaccine responses, potentially informing targeted vaccination strategies in older adults.

        <tr id="Abstract Dysregulated innate immune responses contribute to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), characterized by gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous, and/or cardiovascular injury occurring weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. To investigate innate immune functions, we stimulated ex vivo peripheral blood cells from MIS-C patients with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR), key innate immune response initiators. We found severely dampened cytokine responses and elevated gene expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling. Increased plasma levels of zonulin, a gut leakage marker, were also detected. These effects were also observed in fully convalescent children months after MIS-C recovery. When we investigated the genetic background of patients in relation to TLR responsiveness, we found that cells from MIS-C children carrying rare heterozygous variants of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) were less refractory to TLR stimulation and exhibited lysosomal and mitochondrial abnormalities with altered energy metabolism. Moreover, these rare LYST variant heterozygous carriers tended to exhibit unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation, including more profound lymphopenia. The results of our observational study have several implications. First, TLR hyporesponsiveness may be associated with hyperinflammation and/or excessive or prolonged stimulation with gut-originated TLR ligands. Second, TLR hyporesponsiveness during MIS-C may be protective, since LYST variant heterozygous carriers exhibited reduced TLR hyporesponsiveness and unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation. Thus, links may exist between genetic background, ability to establish a refractory immune state, and MIS-C clinical spectrum. Third, the possibility exists that prolonged TLR hyporesponsiveness is one of the mechanisms driving long coronavirus disease (COVID), which highlights the need to monitor long-term consequences of MIS-C.">

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron has demonstrated decreased pathogenicity, yet a few individuals suffer severe pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection; the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Methods The present work investigated the role of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the occurrence and progression of severe Omicron infection. The expression and dynamic changes of ISGs were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the anti-ISG15 autoantibody in infected patients was detected by ELISA. Moreover, we evaluated the correlation of ISGs with disease severity and outcomes by comparing expression of ISGs among each group. Results Decreased expression of several ISGs such as IFI6 are potentially linked to increased severity or poor outcomes of Omicron infection. Longitudinal data also demonstrates that the dynamic variation of IFI6 in the Omicron infection phase may be linked to the prognosis of the disease. The increase of anti-ISG15 autoantibody potentially links to the disease progression and poor outcome of patients with high level of ISG15 expression. Conclusions These findings define aberrant Interferon-stimulated gene associated host responses and reveal potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets for Omicron or other viral infection.">

        <tr id="Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.">

        <tr id="Adult stem cell therapy holds great promise for treating decompensated liver cirrhosis on the basis of animal studies, despite uncertainty about its clinical therapeutic efficacy and unclear underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigated the role of follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), a profibrotic and proinflammatory matricellular protein, in inflammation-related heterogeneity in stem cell therapy. Our results showed that a high level of circulating FSTL1 is significantly correlated with therapeutic response in patients with cirrhosis. FSTL1 facilitated MSC-mediated early recruitment of Ly6C+ inflammatory macrophages within 24 h postinfusion, which was essential for the empowerment of MSCs and subsequent Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage remodelling at 48 h postinfusion. Fstl1 deficiency abrogated early macrophage recruitment and effective Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage accumulation, resulting in the poor antifibrotic effect of MSCs in mice. Whereas, recombinant FSTL1 protein restored the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in CCl4-injured Fstl1+/− mice. Mechanistically, host FSTL1 enhanced rapid recycling of CCR2 to the membrane via activation of the CD14/TLR4/NF-κB/ATP6V1G2 axis, leading to early recruitment of Ly6C+ monocytes /macrophages. Taken together, our findings revealed that FSTL1 is a critical regulator of the fibrotic immune microenvironment and facilitates subsequent stem cell therapy. These data suggest that FSTL1 could serve as a predictive biomarker of stem cell therapy response in patients with liver cirrhosis.">

        <tr id="Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are known to impact cellular and humoral immune response in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). In this study, we performed in-depth SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell profiling using flow cytometry. T-cell immunity in pwMS with or without DMTs was evaluated before a first SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccination and at one-, two- and six-month follow-up. T-cell stimulation without SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens was used as a control. T-cell response was compared to B-cell response by evaluating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We observed an upregulation of specific subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, our results demonstrate the induction of a broad and distinct CD4+ T-cell response in pwMS even on anti-CD20 treatment and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. This was particularly seen in CD4+high and CD4+CD154+ T cells. Our results do not support the induction of a CD8+ T-cell immune response. While humoral immune response was impaired in pwMS during ocrelizumab and fingolimod treatment, there was evidence of a compensatory upregulation of subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells at low levels of seroconversion in pwMS. In conclusion, our results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the adaptive immune response in pwMS following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.">

        <tr id="Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs’ functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, FCGRT gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of FCGRT showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, TRIM21 transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in TRIM21 transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors DDX58 and IFIH1, the transcriptional level of inflammatory IL1B and IL18 was generally very low, along with the NLRP3 danger sensor, members of the NF-κB pathway, and TNF. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.">

        <tr id="In this study, the critical role of the epipharynx in managing long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and in particular, how residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA affects signalling pathways in the epipharynx were investigated via spatial gene expression analysis (Visium HD). Moreover, we hypothesize that epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) targeting the epipharynx could improve long COVID symptoms by modulating local inflammation and gene expression. We conducted a comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles of three patients with long COVID and two control individuals without COVID-19. Residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the epipharynx of patients with long COVID, along with the activation of signalling pathways in epithelial and immune cells. After EAT, the viral RNA was either completely cleared or significantly reduced. T-cell receptor signalling pathways were suppressed; the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α, were reduced; and excessive antibody production was mitigated. Histology showed that EAT effectively eliminated the inflamed, dysfunctional ciliated epithelium. This study clarifies that SARS-CoV-2 has long-term effects on the immune response in the epipharynx, emphasizing the need to focus on chronic epipharyngitis as a potential cause of long COVID. Furthermore, EAT may offer a promising approach to alleviating persistent long COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection leads to viral encephalitis and neurological damage in mice, causing significant neurological symptoms and brain damage. This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms of PRV-induced encephalopathy and the role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We found that PRV infection increased the number of astrocytes and induced a phenotypic shift from the A2 to the A1 subtype, which was associated with increased secretion of MMP-9. MMP-9 was identified as a critical mediator of PRV-induced BBB disruption, as it degrades collagen VI, leading to BBB damage. PRV was shown to penetrate the BBB via a paracellular pathway, and MMP-9 deletion reversed this damage, mitigating tight junction injury. Additionally, PRV infection caused an “inflammatory storm” in the central nervous system (CNS), with increased levels of the chemokines CCL-3, CCL-4, and CCL-5; the cytokines IL-6 and IL-18; and TNF-α. The expression of INF-γ was significantly decreased. In conclusion, PRV infection disrupts the BBB and induces an inflammatory response in the CNS, with MMP-9 playing a key role in mediating BBB damage. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of PRV-induced encephalopathy and potential therapeutic targets for viral encephalitis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bacteria exhibit distinct behaviors in laboratory settings compared to infection environments. The presence of host cells induces changes in bacterial activity, while pathogens trigger immune responses that shape the microenvironment. Studying infection dynamics by microscopy, cytokine screening, and dual RNA sequencing in an air–liquid interface model, we found that prolonged Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization of airway epithelium led to a pro-inflammatory response, consistent across P. aeruginosa strains, despite differences in the dynamics of this response. Concurrently, P. aeruginosa formed non-attached aggregates on the apical side of the cell layer and upregulated genes involved in biofilm formation and virulence. Notably, there was remarkable resemblance between the P. aeruginosa transcriptional profile in our model and that previously reported upon host cell contact. Developing a platform that replicates host microenvironments is vital not only for gaining deeper insights into the interplay between host and pathogen but also for evaluating therapeutic strategies in conditions that closely mirror clinical environments.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a site of replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and GI symptoms are often reported by patients. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends upon heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, which commensal bacteria that bathe the human mucosa are known to modify. To explore human gut HS-modifying bacterial abundances and how their presence may impact SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a task-based analysis of proteoglycan degradation on large-scale shotgun metagenomic data. We observed that gut bacteria with high predicted catabolic capacity for HS differ by age and sex, factors associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, and directly by disease severity during/after infection, but do not vary between subjects with COVID-19 comorbidities or by diet. Gut commensal bacterial HS-modifying enzymes reduce spike protein binding and infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bacterial grooming of the GI mucosa may impact viral susceptibility. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, can infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and individuals who exhibit GI symptoms often have more severe disease. The GI tract’s glycocalyx, a component of the mucosa covering the large intestine, plays a key role in viral entry by binding SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein via heparan sulfate (HS). Here, using metabolic task analysis of multiple large microbiome sequencing data sets of the human gut microbiome, we identify a key commensal human intestinal bacteria capable of grooming glycocalyx HS and modulating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro. Moreover, we engineered the common probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to effectively block SARS-CoV-2 binding and infection of human cell cultures. Understanding these microbial interactions could lead to better risk assessments and novel therapies targeting viral entry mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Background The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease characterized by leukocyte infiltration in the spinal cord. T-lymphocytes are the most important targets of HTLV-1 infection, but monocytes are also infected. Monocytes from HTLV-1-infected individuals exhibit important functional differences compared to cells from uninfected donors. Here, we investigated the effects of cell-cell physical contact and/or secreted factors of HTLV-1-infected cells in monocyte activation and differentiation. Methods The THP-1 human monocytic cell line was co-cultured with a human cell line transformed by HTLV-1 (MT-2) for 6 days. To determine the effects of co-culturing HTLV-1-infected cells in THP-1 monocytes cells were characterized by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and real-time PCR. Computational analysis of published transcriptomic datasets was realized to compare molecular profiles of macrophages and mononuclear cells from HTLV-1 carriers. Results Co-culture of monocytes with HTLV-1-infected cells induced macrophage differentiation and upregulation of typical macrophages-associated molecules (HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86), increased cytokine (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β) levels and their coding genes expression. Consistently, published transcriptomic datasets showed changes in important genes associated with inflammation during HAM/TSP in patients. The presence of HTLV-1-infected cells in the culture also induced significant upregulation of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISG), indicating viral infection. Monocyte activation and differentiation into pro-inflammatory macrophages occurred in a cell-to-cell contact-independent manner, suggesting the role of factors secreted by infected cells. Conclusions Together, our results indicated that HTLV-1-infected cells induced monocyte differentiation into macrophages inflammatory, predominantly.

We found that mice deficient in platelets’ 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) demonstrate exacerbated inflammation and worse outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. One mediator derived from platelet 12-LOX activity, 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), was found to negatively correlate with disease severity. Taken together our data unravel a possible role of platelets and possibly 12-HETrE, which is documented as promoting anti-inflammatory effects, in dampening the inflammatory burden of infected mice and pinpoints potential new therapeutic strategies (12-LOX inhibitors or 12-HETrE receptor agonists) to better combat severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="Background: The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection during pregnancy on the fetus can be direct—transmitted through the placenta—and indirect—creating unfavorable conditions for the development of the fetus because of inflammation, micro-thrombosis, and hypercoagulation. Our study aimed to determine the types and frequency of pathohistological changes in placental tissue in SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women and to examine the possible role of oxidative stress in the prognosis of the delivery and its maternal and fetal complications. Methods: This prospective clinical study included 50 pregnant women divided into two groups, SARS-CoV-2 positive (COVID-19 group) and SARS-CoV-2 negative (control group), from who we collected demographic, clinical, obstetric, biochemical and pathologic data. Data about the newborn characteristics were also collected, which included anamnestic, clinical, and biochemical data. Results: The values of the superoxide anion radical and index of lipid peroxidation were significantly different in mothers concerning the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the levels of the nitric oxide, index of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, and superoxide dismutase were significantly different in the newborns depending on the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newborn characteristics were similar between groups except for concentrations of IgM antibody. The incidence of pathohistological changes of the FVM type in the COVID-19 group of pregnant women was 46%, while in the control group, the incidence was 18%. Conclusions: This study confirmed the significant impact of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection on maternal and fetal biochemical parameters and oxidative stress-mediated placental dysfunction. Future studies should be performed with more participants and follow-up neonatal development.">

        <tr id="Background Since the emergence of COVID-19 at the end of 2019, the disease has led to widespread acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), who are at increased risk due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy. This study aims to explore the differences in immune responses between kidney transplant recipients and non-kidney transplant recipients in COVID-19-induced ARDS to identify potential therapeutic targets for improving outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 108,320 cells derived from peripheral blood samples to construct a global single-cell map of COVID-19 induced ARDS in kidney transplant recipients(ARDSKT), COVID-19 induced ARDS in non transplant recipients(ARDSNKT), and healthy controls. Subsequently, using cellular clustering analysis, we obtained single-cell maps of different cell types. We employed enrichment analysis to determine the pathways involved in different subpopulations and focused on the role of key immune cells such as monocytes, megakaryocytes, B cells, and CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Significant immune differences were observed between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT. In ARDSKT, the S100A9+ MK subpopulation, which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, was elevated, promoting inflammation. In contrast, the S100A12+ monocyte subpopulation that activates the chemokine signaling pathway was more abundant in ARDSNKT, reflecting a stronger inflammatory response, while its abundance was reduced in ARDSKT due to immunosuppression. The CXCR4+ B subpopulation, crucial for adaptive immunity, was significantly reduced in ARDSKT. Additionally, the XAF1+ Teff subpopulation, associated with apoptosis, was more abundant in ARDSKT, potentially impairing immune recovery. This study highlights the immune differences between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT, revealing the impact of immunosuppression on immune dysregulation. These findings suggest that targeting specific immune pathways can improve therapeutic strategies for ARDSKT.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID‐19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS‐CoV‐2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID‐19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high‐throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID‐19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID‐19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus that can infect the brain, and an uncontrolled infection can lead to a range of diseases, including chronic nerve pain, encephalitis, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. These outcomes are often severe and have lasting consequences, highlighting the need to identify host factors that contribute to disease severity. In this study, we report that intranasal HSV-1 infection in murine model, which promotes viral dissemination into the brain, implicates the host protein heparanase (HPSE) as a key mediator of neuroinflammation. Specifically, we observed that the HPSE activity during HSV-1 infection in naïve animals promotes the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, enhances microglial activity in the brain, and contributes to cognitive impairment, anxiety, and motor coordination deficits. Such effects are significantly less detectable in heparanase deficient (Hpse−/−) mice. Additionally, we found that moderate activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly in Hpse+/+ mice, may contribute to the activation of the inflammasome pathway. This, in turn, leads to the activation of caspase-1 (Casp1) and caspase-3 (Casp3), which may play a role in nerve function loss. Our findings position HPSE as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating virus-induced neuroinflammation and neurobehavioral defects. IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection in the brain can lead to severe and often permanent neurological consequences. Host factors influence disease outcomes in response to infection, and understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective therapies. This study identifies the host protein HPSE as a key mediator of neuroinflammation in response to HSV-1 infection. We demonstrate that the HPSE activity drives proinflammatory cytokine expression and microglial activation and promotes a signaling cascade involving toll-like receptors and caspase activation, potentially intensifying neuroinflammatory responses. These findings implicate HPSE as an important player in HSV-1 pathogenesis in the central nervous system and suggest that targeting HPSE could provide a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate virus-induced neuroinflammation and neurobehavioral disturbance.">

        <tr id="Vesiculovirus carajas (CARV) is a pathogen with neuroinvasive potential, yet its impact on neuroinflammation and sickness behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the neuropathological and immunological responses to CARV encephalitis in adult BALB/c mice. Mice were intranasally inoculated with either infected or uninfected brain homogenates, and clinical, histopathological, and cytokine profiles were analyzed. CARV antigens were primarily detected in necrotic neurons, with prominent microglial activation near the ventricles and blood vessels. By day 10 post-infection, infected mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of MCP-1, IFN-γ, IL-12 p70, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in the brain, indicating a strong inflammatory response. These findings highlight the inflammatory modulation associated with CARV infection and suggest a hematogenous route of neuroinvasion, distinguishing CARV from other vesiculovirus species. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of CARV encephalitis and its potential impact on neuroimmune dynamics.">

        <tr id="The health burden of ocular toxoplasmosis is substantial, and there is an unmet need for safe and curative anti-microbial drugs. One major barrier to research on new therapeutics is the lack of in vitro human-based models beyond two-dimensional cultured cells and tissue explants. We aimed to address this research gap by establishing a human retinal organoid model of ocular toxoplasmosis. Retinal organoids, generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells and grown to two stages of organization, were incubated with a suspension of live or heat-killed GT-1 strain T. gondii tachyzoites, or medium without tachyzoites. Both developing (1 month post-isolation) and matured (6 months post-isolation) organoids were susceptible to infection. Spread of live parasites from the margin to the entire organoid over 1 week was indicated by immunolabelling for T. gondii surface antigen 1. This progression was accompanied by changes in the levels of selected tachyzoite transcripts—SAG1, GRA6, and ROP16—and human cytokine transcripts—CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, and IL6—in infected versus control conditions. Our human retinal organoid model of ocular toxoplasmosis offers the opportunity for many future lines of study, including tachyzoite interactions with retinal cell populations and leukocyte subsets, parasite stage progression, and disease processes of different T. gondii strains, as well as drug testing.">

        <tr id="The understanding of how the host immune response differs in T-cell phenotype and memory formation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) remains limited. LTRs who recovered from COVID-19 infection without prior vaccination represent a unique population for studying immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Six LTRs with positive neutralizing antibodies (nAb+) and six LTRs with negative nAb (nAb-) were included at 6 months following COVID-19 infection. It was found that nAb+ LTRs had higher anti-RBD IgG titers and greater neutralizing percent inhibition compared to nAb- LTRs. Fifteen T-cell subsets were identified in COVID-19 convalescent LTRs, and it was shown that only terminal effector CD8+ - 3 decreased in the nAb+ group, while elevated IL-10 expression levels were found in the nAb- group. After stimulation with the SARS-CoV-2 XBB spike peptide pool in vitro, it was observed that the nAb+ group exhibited an increase in effector memory CD4+ cells with lower PD-1 expression, a reduction in effector memory CD4+ - 2 cells, and terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells, while the nAb- group showed high expression of CTLA-4 and IL-10 in terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells. Four SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell subsets were identified, with high expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ in terminal effector CD8+ - 1 and terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in both groups. Perforin was mainly detected in terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in nAb+ LTRs. In addition to these proportional differences, stem cell memory CD4+ cells with higher IL-17A expression and stem cell memory CD8+ cells with higher CTLA-4 expression were also found in nAb- LTRs. These findings suggest that LTRs who developed nAb+ following SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit stronger T-cell responses, with more robust immune activation and memory recall, compared to nAb- LTRs. This study underscores the importance of understanding T-cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 recovery for guiding vaccination strategies and managing immunity in LTRs.">

        <tr id="Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a leading cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide, and the only zoonotic hepatitis virus. HEV genotype 3 (HEV3) is associated with a range of clinical presentations including chronic infection in immunocompromised individuals in developed nations as well as sporadic cases of autochthonous HEV3 in Europe. Current in vitro models support low levels of HEV infection, hampering our understanding of viral pathogenesis and development of therapeutics. We developed modified culture methods for two widely used hepatoma cell lines, PLC-PRF-5 and Huh-7.5, and evaluated HEV infection. Simple epithelial-like polarity and differentiation formed in PLC-PRF-5 cells, evidenced by localisation of tight junction proteins occludin and zona-occludin 1 to intercellular junctions, and increased albumin production. Complex hepatocyte-like polarity was observed in Huh-7.5 cells, with tight junction proteins localised to shared internal bile canaliculi-like structures and retention of the fluorescent molecule, 5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein diacetate. Cells were infected with genotype 3 HEV, and enhanced infection and replication of HEV was observed using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescent labelling of HEV ORF2 and dsRNA. We describe robust, accessible models for HEV infection in vitro. These models will allow studies to further our understanding of this emerging zoonotic pathogen and develop therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with ACE2, a key receptor within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis, regulating blood pressure, and modulating inflammation. An observational study analyzed the gene expression profiles of RAAS receptors and associated miRNAs in 88 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls, comparing the acute and post-acute phases to assess their impact on disease severity and recovery. Our findings revealed an association between reduced MAS1 expression in both advanced age (P = 0.03) and the need for oxygen supplementation (P = 0.04). Additionally, reduced ACE expression was associated with worse mortality outcomes (P = 0.01). Notably, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) in individuals requiring oxygen supplementation and in those with diabetes mellitus during both the acute and post-COVID-19 phases, further highlighting the impact of these conditions on RAAS. The miRNA analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-200c (P = 0.005), miR-let-7 (P = 0.01), and miR-122 (P = 0.03) in acute-phase COVID-19 patients. This dysregulation contributes to the inflammatory response and highlights the interaction between viral entry and immune regulation. These results underscore the significance of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MAS1 axis in inflammation regulation and suggest that targeting this pathway may have therapeutic potential. Our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and identifies the modulation of RAAS receptors and miRNAs as promising biomarkers for disease severity and potential therapeutic interventions.

A developing perspective suggests that TLRs play a central role in neuroinflammation, a fundamental factor in neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This comprehensive review consolidates current research investigating the potential interplay between TLRs, their signaling mechanisms, and the processes of neurodegeneration following SARS-CoV-2 infection with an aim to elucidate the involvement of TLRs in the long-term neurological complications of COVID-19 and explore the potential of targeting TLRs as a means of implementing intervention strategies for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19-associated long-term brain outcomes.">

        <tr id="Introduction Post-COVID syndrome, also known as long COVID, has emerged as a major public health concern, affecting a substantial proportion of individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This condition is characterized by persistent symptoms lasting at least 2 months after acute infection, significantly impacting quality of life and increasing healthcare burdens. In Kazakhstan, the recognition of post- COVID syndrome in national clinical protocols highlights the need for effective prevention and management strategies. Vaccination has been suggested as a key intervention to reduce the severity and prevalence of long COVID symptoms, yet data on its effectiveness, particularly for the domestic QazVac vaccine, remain limited. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of vaccination with the domestic QazVac vaccine on the features of humoral and cellular immunity in patients with post-COVID conditions and to identify the leading clinical variants of the course. Methods We analyzed data from 90 vaccinated and 217 non-vaccinated patients, examining sex, age, smoking status, BMI, comorbidities, and clinical manifestations. Results There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to sex, age, and smoking status. However, the characteristics of the subjects indicated that vaccination was correlated with a lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus (2.2% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.011) and cardiovascular diseases (0.0% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.047), and a higher prevalence of hypertension among non-vaccinated subjects. With regard to clinical symptoms, vaccinated individuals presented a significantly decreased frequency of neurological (51.1% vs. 74.2%, p = 0.001), gastrointestinal (4.4% vs. 15.2%, p = 0.008), respiratory (21.1% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.009), rheumatological symptoms (26.7% vs. 38.7%, p = 0.044), and kidney symptoms (2.2% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.024). In contrast, unvaccinated participants had more memory loss (49.8% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.001), depression (31.3% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001), joint pain (33.2% vs. 14.4%, p = 0.001), and other psychopathological symptoms. Discussion A sharp decrease in the frequency of neurological, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and rheumatological symptoms was recorded in vaccinated patients, advocating for the protective role of vaccination against long COVID-19 sequelae. These findings highlight the potential for vaccination to mitigate the burden of post-COVID complications across various organ systems.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly enhanced our understanding of CD8+ T cell immunity and their role in natural infection and vaccine-induced protection. Rapid and early SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses have been associated with efficient viral clearance and mild disease. Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses can compensate for waning, morbidity-related, and iatrogenic reduction of humoral immunity. After infection or vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells are formed, which mount an efficient recall response in the event of breakthrough infection and help to protect from severe disease. Due to their breadth and ability to target mainly highly conserved epitopes, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are also able to cross-recognize epitopes of viral variants, thus maintaining immunity even after the emergence of viral evolution. In some cases, however, CD8+ T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. In particular, delayed and uncontrolled, e.g., nonspecific and hyperactivated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses have been linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes. In this minireview, we summarize the tremendous knowledge about CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination that has been gained over the past 5 years, while also highlighting the critical knowledge gaps that remain.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity provides the critical first line of defense against infection and sterile triggers. Cell death is a key component of the innate immune response to clear pathogens, but excessive or aberrant cell death can induce inflammation, cytokine storm, and pathology, making it a central molecular mechanism in inflammatory diseases. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one such inflammatory disease, but the specific innate immune mechanisms driving pathology in this context remain unclear. Here, by leveraging RNAseq and tissue expression in clinical samples, we identified increased expression of the innate immune sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) in patients with ALD. We discovered that ZBP1 expression correlated with ALD progression in patients, and that ethanol induced ZBP1-dependent lytic cell death, PANoptosis, in immune (macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells) and non-immune cells (hepatocytes). Mechanistically, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF9 and IRF1 upregulated ZBP1 expression, allowing ZBP1 to sense Z-NAs through its Zα2 domain and drive PANoptosis signaling, cell membrane rupture through NINJ1, and DAMP release. Furthermore, the expressions of ZBP1 and NINJ1 were upregulated in both liver and serum samples from patients with ALD. In mouse models of chronic and acute ALD, ZBP1-deficient mice were significantly protected from disease pathology and liver damage. Overall, our findings establish the critical role of the ZBP1-NINJ1 axis regulated by IRFs in driving inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in liver cells, suggesting that targeting these molecules will have therapeutic potential in ALD and other inflammatory conditions.">

Specifically, S1P1 ligands inhibit cytokine storm and help preserve lung endothelial barrier integrity. We recently showed that the S1P receptor ligand ozanimod can be safely administered to hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibiting severe symptoms of viral pneumonia, with potential clinical benefits. Here, we extend on this study and investigate the impact of ozanimod on key features of the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. We quantified circulating cytokine levels, peripheral immune cell numbers, proportions and activation status; we also monitored the quality of the humoral response by assessing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) antibodies. Our findings reveal that patients receiving ozanimod during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significantly reduced numbers of circulating monocytes compared with those receiving standard care. Correspondingly, in the ozanimod-treated group, circulating levels of C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) were decreased. While treatment with ozanimod negatively impacted the humoral response to COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, it did not impair the development of a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in vaccinated patients. These findings suggest that ozanimod influences key immune mechanisms during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can provide information on patient immunity, identify asymptomatic patients, and track the spread of COVID-19. Efforts have been made to develop methods to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Here, we describe a flow cytometric assay for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in human plasma. To assess the antibody response against the different SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, five viral recombinant proteins, including spike protein subunit 1 (S1), N-terminal domain of S1 (S1A), spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein subunit 2 (S2), and nucleocapsid protein (N), were generated. A comparison of the antibody profiles detected by the assay with plasma from 100 healthy blood donors collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and plasma from 100 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated a clear discrimination between the two groups. Among the COVID-19 patients, the antibody responses for the viral proteins, as determined by their prevalence, were anti-RBD IgG = anti-N IgG > anti-S1 IgG > anti-S1A IgG > anti-S2 IgG, and anti-RBD IgM > anti-S1 IgM > anti-N IgM > anti-S2 IgM. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM was not associated with sex, age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness, except for a higher prevalence of anti-S2 IgG being observed in men than in women. The levels of anti-RBD IgG were higher in patients 65 years and older and in patients who had severe symptoms. Similarly, patients who had severe symptoms exhibited higher levels of anti-S1 and anti-S1A IgG than patients who had mild or moderate symptoms. The levels of anti-RBD IgM tended to be higher in men but did not differ among age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness. Our study indicates that the flow cytometric assay, especially using RBD as target antigen, can be used to detect simultaneously anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in human plasma.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Splenectomy or congenital asplenia is associated with severe reduction of memory B cells and increased risk of fulminant sepsis by encapsulated bacteria. Current guidelines recommend vaccinations against these pathogens before or after splenectomy, but the longevity of immunity acquired after splenectomy has not been determined. The impact of splenectomy on innate immune cells is unknown. We analyzed frequency, differentiation stage, and function of innate and adaptive immunity in the peripheral blood of adult (n = 41) and pediatric (n = 14) patients splenectomized or born asplenic and in spleens of solid organ donors. The absence of the spleen impacts the B‐cell compartment, causing a significant increase of circulating immature transitional and depletion of memory B cells. Using SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination as a model, we show that 1 year after the last immunization, despite normal levels of neutralizing antibodies, memory B and T cells were significantly reduced. Analysis of post‐pandemic spleens shows that spike‐specific memory B and T cells homed to the spleen. We also show a previously unrecognized role of the spleen in the homeostasis of innate NK and Vδ2 T cells. These populations showed altered phenotype and impaired function in the adults, but not in children, suggesting that other tissues may support innate cell development during early life. The reduced function of innate lymphocytes must be considered as an additional immune impairment and risk factor. These findings emphasize the spleen's irreplaceable role in maintaining immune memory across all ages and suggest that its absence contributes to dysfunctions of innate and adaptive immunity in adults.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has largely concluded, the varied trajectories it has followed in different regions of the world remain incompletely understood. Intensive research is needed to fully grasp its course and the implications for future global health challenges. Notably, the milder trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sub-Saharan Africa has defied initial predictions. An emerging body of evidence suggests that, in addition to the continent’s younger average age and the lower prevalence of relevant comorbidities, co-infections with helminths may have also impressively shaped the pandemic’s milder trajectory in the region. Indeed, helminths are renowned for their ability to modulate human immune responses, which, while potentially beneficial in limiting excessive inflammation, could also diminish vaccine efficacy and impede viral clearance. This study investigated different aspects of the intricate interactions between COVID-19 and Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), a helminth infection caused by parasitic worms such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori and endemic to various regions in Sub-Saharan Africa and the tropics. Methods: For this purpose, samples of a larger and ongoing clinical trial (ethical approval codes: CHRPE/AP/525/17 and 325/21; trial registration number ISRCTN14042737) were collected from 222 individuals from endemic areas of Ghana, along with comprehensive clinical and demographic data. The samples include LF patients (n = 222) grouped according to their Lymphoedema (LE) stages, as well as COVID-19 vaccinated (n = 81) and non-vaccinated individuals (n = 141). All vaccinated participants received the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1-S (also known as Vaxzevria) developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZenca. The expressions of SARS-CoV-2 and filarial-specific antibodies (IgG, IgA) were accessed using ELISA, while Luminex-based immunoassays were employed to measure the expression of SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific neutralizing antibodies. The interplay between vaccine responses and demographic factors was analyzed using group comparisons with the Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: The results indicate that a remarkable portion of unvaccinated individuals (56% IgA seropositive, 39% IgG seropositive) developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 despite no confirmed infection. Notably, the study identified a robust antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination, which was independent of the degree of LF pathology or parasitic status. An important observation was the reduced SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in individuals seropositive for Ascaris lumbricoides (p = 0.0264), highlighting an interaction between roundworm infection and COVID-19. Conclusions: The study concludes that the ChAdOx1-S COVID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca) triggers a strong immune response in LF patients; however, filarial and/or soil-transmitted helminth seropositivity might influence the COVID-19 infection-induced response. These findings emphasize the complexity of infectious disease dynamics in co-infected populations and the need to decipher parasite-induced immunomodulatory mechanisms on COVID-19 vaccination.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on all aspects of human activity worldwide, frequently resulting in post-acute sequelae and affecting multiple organ systems. The underlying mechanisms driving both acute and post-acute manifestations of COVID-19 are still poorly understood, warranting further investigation for new targets. The study represents the first attempt to explore the role of T-cadherin in COVID-19 pathogenesis as well as its implications in pulmonary fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. First, we revealed a significant decrease in T-cadherin expression in post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19 patients. This downregulated T-cadherin expression correlated with the elevated levels of VE-cadherin and reduced levels of β-catenin, suggesting a disruption in endothelial cell-cell contact integrity and function. Second, the reciprocal relation of T-cadherin and VE-cadherin expression was further confirmed using cultured human endothelial Ea.hy926 cells. T-cadherin overexpression caused a decrease in VE-cadherin mRNA expression in cultured endothelial cells providing additional evidence in favor of their interplay. Third, employing Cdh13 −/− mice, we unveiled the protective role of T-cadherin deficiency against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Fourth, we demonstrated the mice lacking T-cadherin to have downregulated reactive oxygen species production and Nox2 mRNA expression in an angiotensin II-mediated endothelial dysfunction model. Our findings provide rationale for further studies into T-cadherin-mediated mechanisms in these processes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Patients with hematologic diseases have experienced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a prolonged, progressive course. Here, we present clinical, pathological, and virological analyses of three cases of prolonged COVID-19 among patients undergoing treatment for B-cell lymphoma. These patients had all been treated with anti-CD20 antibody and bendamustine. Despite various antiviral treatments, high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) levels persisted for >4 weeks, and two of them succumbed to COVID-19. The autopsy showed bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrosis. Overlapping cytomegalovirus, fungal and/or bacterial infections were also confirmed. Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed accumulation of mutations and changes in variant allele frequencies over time. NSP12 mutations V792I and M794I appeared independently in two cases as COVID-19 progressed. In vitro drug susceptibility analysis and an animal experiment using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that each mutation, V792 and M794I, was independently responsible for remdesivir resistance and attenuated pathogenicity. E340A, E340D, and F342INS mutations in the spike protein were found in one case, which may account for the sotrovimab resistance. Analysis of autopsy specimens indicated heterogeneous distribution of these mutations. In summary, we demonstrated temporal and spatial diversity in SARS-CoV-2 that evolved resistance to various antiviral agents in malignant lymphoma patients under immunodeficient conditions caused by certain types of immunochemotherapies. Strategies may be necessary to prevent the acquisition of drug resistance and improve outcomes, such as the selection of appropriate treatment strategies for lymphoma considering patients’ immune status and the institution of early intensive antiviral therapy.">

        <tr id="Background Mycobacterium abscessus complex pulmonary disease (MABC-PD) is a chronic and often relapsing disease with considerable morbidity, especially among individuals with other chronic pulmonary conditions. A major clinical challenge lies in distinguishing infection-related symptoms from underlying lung disease and identifying reliable prognosticators to guide treatment decisions and monitoring therapeutic response. Methodology/Principal Findings To address the gaps in clinically relevant indicators, we profiled whole blood transcriptome and 45 plasma proteins of MABC-PD patients across different disease and treatment phases. Whole blood bulk RNA-sequencing revealed that MABC-PD patients with progressive disease exhibited elevated expression of genes related to innate immune and inflammatory responses, with reduced abundance of genes associated with peripheral T and NK cells. Among the 45 plasma cytokines and chemokines profiled, plasma levels of TNFSF10 were significantly reduced, while IFNγ, interleukin-17F (IL17F) and IL17C were elevated in patients with disease progression, despite the reduced abundance of peripheral T and NK cell-associated genes, suggesting recruitment of activated T cells to infection sites in the lungs during disease progression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of IFNγ and IL17F demonstrated strong predictive performance for differentiating patients with disease progression from healthy controls, with AUCs of 0.946 (95% CI 0.829-1.000) and 0.875 (95% CI 0.6699-1), respectively. Conclusions These findings provide insights into the immune profiles of MABC-PD patients during disease progression and suggest that T cell-associated cytokines, such as IFNγ and IL17F, could serve as useful biomarkers for identifying those under watchful waiting or post-treatment who are at risk of disease progression, thereby aiding in more timely and targeted therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Acute lung injury (ALI) or its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), represents a critical condition characterized by extensive inflammation within the airways. Necroptosis, a form of cell death, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. However, the precise characteristics and mechanisms of necroptosis in ARDS remain unclear. Thus, our study seeks to elucidate the specific alterations and regulatory factors associated with necroptosis in ARDS and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the disease. We discovered that necroptosis mediates the progression of ALI through the activation and formation of the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL complex. Moreover, we substantiated the involvement of both MYD88 and TRIF in the activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway in ALI. Furthermore, we have developed a lipid micelle-encapsulated drug targeting MLKL in alveolar type II epithelial cells and successfully applied it to treat ALI in mice. This targeted nanoparticle selectively inhibited necroptosis, thereby mitigating epithelial cell damage and reducing inflammatory injury. Our study delves into the specific mechanisms of necroptosis in ALI and proposes novel targeted therapeutic agents, presenting innovative strategies for the management of ARDS.">

        <tr id="The nature of the effector and memory T cell response in the lungs following acute SARS-CoV-2 infections remains largely unknown. To define the pulmonary T-cell response to COVID-19, we compared effector and memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in mice. Both viruses elicited potent effector T cell responses in lungs, but memory T cells showed exaggerated contraction in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, unlike the T-bet/EOMES-driven effector transcription program in IAV lungs, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells embarked on a STAT-3-centric transcriptional program, a defining characteristic of a pro-fibro-inflammatory program: limited cytotoxicity, diminished expression of tissue-protective inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT), and augmented mucosal imprinting (CD103). Circulating CD45RO+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients expressed elevated levels of STAT-3 and low levels of TIGIT. IL-6 blockade experiments implicated IL-6 in STAT-3 induction and downregulation of PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific primary effector CD8 T cells. Memory CD8 T cells specific to a single epitope, induced by mucosal vaccination, differentiated into cytotoxic effectors and expressed high levels of CD103, effectively reducing viral burden in lungs following a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings have implications for developing targeted immunotherapies to mitigate immunopathology and promote protective T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background COVID‐19 exhibits a variety of symptoms and may lead to multi‐organ failure and death. This clinical complexity is exacerbated by significant immune dysregulation affecting nearly all cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. Granulocytes, including eosinophils, are affected by SARS‐CoV‐2. Objectives Eosinophil responses remain poorly understood despite early recognition of eosinopenia as a hallmark feature of COVID‐19 severity. Results The heterogeneous nature of eosinophil responses categorizes them as dual‐function cells with contradictory effects. Eosinophil activation can suppress virus‐induced inflammation by releasing type 2 cytokines like IL‐13 and granular proteins with antiviral action such as eosinophil‐derived neurotoxins and eosinophil cationic protein, and also by acting as antigen‐presenting cells. In contrast, eosinophil accumulation in the lungs can induce tissue damage triggered by cytokines or hormones like IFN‐γ and leptin. Additionally, they can affect adaptive immune functions by interacting with T cells through direct formation of membrane complexes or soluble mediator action. Individuals with allergic disorders who have elevated levels of eosinophils in tissues and blood, such as asthma, do not appear to be at an increased risk of developing severe COVID‐19 following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. However, the SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine appears to be associated with complications and eosinophilic infiltrate‐induced immunopathogenicity, which can be mitigated by corticosteroid, anti‐histamines and anti‐IL‐5 therapy and avoided by modifying adjuvants or excipients. Conclusion This review highlights the importance of eosinophils in COVID‐19 and contributes to a better understanding of their role during natural infection and vaccination.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lung diseases are widespread worldwide. Pulmonary immunity plays a vital role against lung pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the pathogenesis, including the development of local immune responses to infection, is fundamental for developing interventions to control the viral infection. Methods Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and euthanized 11–14 days later. Results Tertiary lymphoid tissue was found in all SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. The number (13.9 vs 1.5 iPLT number/ lung cm2), size (25992 vs 13946 µm2) and total area (0.46 vs 0.02 mm2 iPLT/ lung cm2) of the lymphoid tissue aggregations were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals than that of normal controls. This induced pulmonary lymphoid tissues comprised B cells, T cells, CD169 macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells with evidence of lymphocyte priming and differentiation. Discussion The results suggest local immunity plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study of pulmonary immunity could lead to new interventions to develop vaccine strategies and discover new immune-regulatory biomarkers in monitoring and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and other lung diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Recent surveillance has identified the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron ariant, which exhibits the ability to evade multiple neutralizing antibodies generated by prior infection or vaccination. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the CD8 T-cell immune reactivity to the Omicron variant. This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of HLA-A2-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes from the Omicron variant and analyze epitope-specific CD8 T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccines. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis of CD8 T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccines, focusing on HLA-A2-restricted epitopes derived from the Omicron variant. Mutant epitopes were evaluated for their impact on antigen presentation and CD8 T-cell immune reactivity. Additionally, we screened for epitopes that exhibited reduced CD8 T-cell responses following the emergence of the Omicron variant. Results Our findings revealed that mutant epitopes in the Omicron variant led to escape from antigen presentation and diminished CD8 T-cell immune responses. We identified two epitopes associated with decreased CD8 T-cell reactivity post-Omicron variant emergence. Notably, we discovered an S protein epitope, 67A>V, which demonstrated similar proportions of CD8 T-cell specificity between the ancestral and mutant strains, suggesting its conservation and potential immunogenicity for vaccine development. Furthermore, the third dose of the inactivated vaccine significantly increased the number of epitope-specific CD8 T cells, underscoring the importance of booster doses in enhancing cellular immune responses against the Omicron variant. Discussion This study highlights the ability of the Omicron variant to evade CD8 T-cell immune responses through epitope mutations, while also identifying conserved epitopes with potential utility in vaccine design. The observed increase in epitope-specific CD8 T cells following a booster dose emphasizes the critical role of additional vaccinations in strengthening cellular immunity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of next-generation vaccines targeting conserved epitopes and optimizing booster strategies.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged the current understanding of the complement cascade mechanisms of host immune responses during infection-induced nonresolvable lung disease. While the complement system is involved in opsonization and phagocytosis of the invading pathogens, uncontrolled complement activation also leads to aberrant autophagic response and tissue damage. Our recent study revealed unique pathologic and fibrotic signature genes associated with epithelial bronchiolization in the lung tissues of patients with nonresolvable COVID-19 (NR-COVID-19) requiring lung transplantation. However, there is a knowledge gap if complement components are modulated to contribute to tissue damage and the fibrotic phenotype during NR-COVID-19. We, therefore, aimed to study the role of the complement factors and their corresponding regulatory proteins in the pathogenesis of NR-COVID-19. We further examined the association of complement components with mediators of the host autophagic response. We observed significant upregulation of the expression of the classical pathway factor C1qrs and alternative complement factors C3 and C5a, as well as the anaphylatoxin receptor C5aR1, in NR-COVID-19 lung tissues. Of note, complement regulatory protein, decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) was significantly downregulated at both transcript and protein levels in the NR-COVID-19 lungs, indicating a dampened host protective response. Furthermore, we observed significantly decreased levels of the autophagy mediators PPARγ and LC3a/b, which was corroborated by decreased expression of factor P and the C3b receptor CR1, indicating impaired clearance of damaged cells that may contribute to the fibrotic phenotype in NR-COVID-19 patients. Thus, our study revealed previously unrecognized complement dysregulation associated with impaired cell death and clearance of damaged cells, which may promote NR-COVID-19 in patients, ultimately necessitating lung transplantation.

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential players in the immune response to infections, involved in shaping innate and adaptive immunity. However, a complete understanding of their specific roles in respiratory infections, including SARS‐CoV‐2, remains elusive. Methods To investigate the dynamics of monocytes and DCs in blood as well as the upper and lower airways, we sampled 147 patients with varying degree of COVID‐19 severity longitudinally during the spring of 2020. Results Using flow cytometry, proteomics and in vitro TLR stimulation, we found differences in the distribution and function of monocytes and DCs in patients compared with controls, and importantly, reduced levels of DCs in both blood and airways. In fact, lower frequencies of cDC2s (Lin− HLA‐DR+ CD1c+) early after symptom onset predicted subsequent severe disease, and depletion of DC subsets lasted longer in patients with more severe disease. In contrast, severe COVID‐19 was associated with increased frequencies of activated monocytes in the lower, but not the upper, airways. Proteomic analysis showed that monocyte and DC‐related cytokines in plasma and airways associated with disease severity. During convalescence, cell frequencies and responses to TLR ligands normalised in blood, except for persistently low plasmacytoid DCs. Conclusion Our study reveals a distinct pattern of recruitment of monocytes but not DCs to the airways during severe COVID‐19. Instead, decreased levels of DCs in both blood and airways were found, possibly contributing to more severe COVID‐19. The connection between low blood DCs early in disease course and more severe outcomes provides insight into COVID‐19 immunopathology, with possible therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with microcephaly in neonates and neurological disorders in adults. Chronic ZIKV infection has been identified in the testes, indicating that the virus can lead to prolonged illness, yet its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we found that ZIKV infection does not induce significant cell death in mouse macrophages despite the critical role that cell death plays in the antiviral immune response. Furthermore, we discovered that ZIKV infection impairs the activation of the NLPR3-dependent inflammasome and inhibits apoptosis. Consequently, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome and apoptosis in the context of ZIKV infection. Our results revealed significant reductions in the protein expression levels of NLRP3 and A20, attributable to post-transcriptional or translational effects during ZIKV infection. These findings suggest that ZIKV infection may disrupt cell death pathways, leading to its pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV), first isolated from a nonhuman primate in Africa in 1947, was relatively understudied until 2016. By then, ZIKV had already been reported in more than 20 countries and territories. The infection poses a significant risk, as it is associated with microcephaly in infants and neurological disorders in adults; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these severe outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that ZIKV infection significantly reduces the expression of NLRP3 and A20 proteins through post-transcriptional or translational processes, which leads to inhibited cell death. These findings are critical because cell death plays a vital role in the host's antiviral immune response. Our findings highlight how ZIKV infection compromises essential cell death pathways, raising serious concerns about its pathogenesis. A comprehensive understanding of this disruption is vital for developing targeted interventions to mitigate the virus' impact on public health.">

        <tr id="Background The intricacies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing acute lung injury (ALI) and modulating inflammatory factor dynamics in vivo remain poorly elucidated. The present study endeavors to explore the impact of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (S1SP) on ALI and inflammatory factor profiles in mice, aiming to uncover potential therapeutic targets and intervention strategies for the prevention and management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods To mimic COVID-19 infection, K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were intratracheally instilled with S1SP, while C57BL/6 mice were administered LPS to form a positive control group. This setup facilitated the examination of lung injury severity, inflammatory factor levels, and alterations in signaling pathways in mice mimicking COVID-19 infection. Histopathological assessment through HE staining, along with analysis of lung wet/dry ratio and ultrasound imaging, revealed severe lung injury. Results After molding, K18-hACE2 mice exhibited a pronounced reduction in body weight and showed more significant lung injury (P < 0.05). Notably, there was a significant elevation in vascular permeability, total protein, and total white blood cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (P < 0.05), indicative of tissue damage. Additionally, the tight junction of lung tissue was compromised (P < 0.05), accompanied by intense oxidative stress marked by decreased SOD activity and elevated MDA content (P < 0.05). Cytokine levels, including IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MIG, were significantly upregulated in both BALF and serum of S1SP + K18 mice (P < 0.05). Furthermore, S1SP prominently augmented the expression of p-p65/P65 and attenuated IκBα expression in the NF-κB signaling pathway of humanized mice (P < 0.05), corroborating a heightened inflammatory response at the tissue level (P < 0.05). Conclusion The administration of S1SP to K18-hACE2 mice resulted in severe lung injury, enhanced vascular permeability, and compromised epithelial barrier function in vivo. This was accompanied by disruption of lung tight junctions, the manifestation of severe oxidative stress and a cytokine storm, as well as the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, highlighting key pathological processes underlying COVID-19-induced lung injury.

        <tr id="Objectives/Goals: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to impact multiple organ systems, including the brain, and is associated with increased cognitive decline in vulnerable populations. The gut microbiome may play a significant role in modulating these effects, as shifts in microbiota composition have been linked to inflammation and systemic disease processes. Methods/Study Population: To explore these interactions, we conducted an acute COVID-19 study using 12-week-old C57 mice intranasally inoculated with 1x10^4 PFU of the Mouse Adapted 10 (MA-10) strain of SARS-CoV-2. On day 5 postinfection, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing on fecal samples, analyzed using QIIME2 and DeSeq2, to assess microbiome alterations and identify changes in metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory responses. Results/Anticipated Results: Analysis revealed notable shifts in the gut microbiome during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, with significant alterations in metabolic pathways related to inflammation and immune regulation. These changes suggest that early gut microbiome disruptions may contribute to the host response in acute COVID-19. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Our findings indicate that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to rapid alterations in the gut microbiome, which could underlie inflammatory and immune pathways impacting disease progression. These insights highlight the potential for microbiome-targeted therapies to mitigate acute COVID-19 morbidity and warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background and Aim COVID‐19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) as a pandemic infectious disease. So far, it has been known that this virus uses several receptors to enter the host cell, one of which is neuropilin‐1 (NRP1). Also, one of the main causes of clinical manifestations, severity of disease, and mortality of patients is cytokine storm syndrome, one of these cytokines being interleukin (IL)‐6. Our aim was to study the level of expression of NRP1 and IL‐6 genes in COVID‐19 patients by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Materials and Methods Our study population included the test group (80 patients with COVID‐19) and the control group (30 healthy individuals). Venous blood was taken from all subjects. After isolating PBMCs from blood using Ficoll, RNA was extracted. Then, cDNA synthesis, the expression level of NRP1 and IL‐6 compared to GAPDH housekeeping gene was measured by real‐time PCR. Results The level of NRP1 gene expression was increased significantly in COVID‐19 different groups compared to the control group. Surprisingly, it was observed that the amount of NRP1 gene decreased in the vaccinated group compared to nonvaccinated groups. IL‐6 gene expression was also significantly increased in all groups except vaccinated patients compared to the control group. Also, the results indicated that there was a positive and statistically considerable relationship between IL‐6 expression level and NRP1 expression level (p = 0.03). Conclusion The significant increase in the expression of NRP1 and IL‐6 genes in COVID‐19 patients, especially in moderate and severe cases, indicates their potential involvement in the progression of the disease, which may serve as biomarkers of disease severity. Also, since these genes play an important role in causing severe inflammation, cytokine storm, and immunopathological complications of COVID‐19, further investigations maybe needed to achieve therapeutic goals to control COVID‐19 and similar diseases.">

        <tr id="Pulmonary fibrosis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19. β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, has been shown to be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis). In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-hACE2 cell model to evaluate the efficacy of the A549-hACE2 monoclonal cell line against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The A549-hACE2 cells were then subjected to either knockdown or overexpression of the effector β-catenin, and the modified cells were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we employed transcriptomics and raw letter analysis approaches to investigate other potential effects of β-catenin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We successfully established a model of cellular fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung-derived cells. This model can be utilized to investigate the molecular biological mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways associated with virus-induced lung fibrosis. The results of our mechanistic studies indicate that β-catenin plays a significant role in lung fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the inhibition of β-catenin mitigated the accumulation of mesenchymal stroma in A549-hACE2 cells. Additionally, β-catenin knockdown was found to facilitate multi-pathway crosstalk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that β-catenin overexpression did not exacerbate cellular fibrosis may be attributed to the activation of PPP2R2B.">

        <tr id="Background Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play a key role in systemic sclerosis (SSc) pathophysiology. However, despite the recognised importance of metabolic reprogramming for pDC function, their metabolic profile in SSc remains to be elucidated. Thus, our study aimed to explore the metabolic profile of pDCs in SSc and their potential contribution to the disease. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and SSc patients. SCENITH™, a single-cell flow cytometry-based method, was applied to infer the metabolic profile of circulating pDCs from patients with SSc. pDCs (CD304+ Lin−) at steady-state or stimulated with CpG A were analysed. Toll-like receptor (TLR)9 activation was confirmed by ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation. Results Circulating pDCs from ten healthy donors and fourteen SSc patients were analysed. pDCs from anti-centromere antibody-positive (ACA+) patients displayed higher mitochondrial dependence and lower glycolytic capacity than those from anti-topoisomerase I antibody-positive (ATA+) patients. Furthermore, cells from both ACA+ patients and limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) patients showed a stronger response towards TLR9 activation than cells from ATA+, anti-RNA polymerase III antibody-positive (ARA+) or diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) patients. Conclusions An innovative single cell flow cytometry-based methodology was applied to analyse the metabolic profile of pDCs from SSc patients. Our results suggest that pDCs from ACA+ patients rely more on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and are more responsive to external stimuli, whereas pDCs from ATA+ patients may exhibit a more activated or exhausted profile.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection primarily affects the respiratory system but may induce hematological alterations such as anemia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Previous studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs); however, the subsequent effects on hematopoiesis and immune reconstitution have not yet been described. Here we evaluated the pathological effects of infection of umbilical-cord-blood-derived HSPCs with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant pseudovirus (PsV). Transcriptomic analysis of Omicron PsV-infected HSPCs revealed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation, aging and the NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting a potential trigger of inflammaging. Omicron PsV-infected HSPCs presented decreased numbers of multipotential progenitors (granulocyte‒erythrocyte‒macrophage‒megakaryocyte colony-forming units) ex vivo and repopulated primitive hematopoietic stem cells (Ki-67−hCD34+ cells) in an HSPC transplantation NOD-scid IL2rγnull mouse model (Omicron mouse). Furthermore, Omicron PsV infection induced myeloid-biased differentiation of HSPCs. Treatment with nanographene oxide, an antiviral agent, partially mitigated the myeloid bias and inflammaging phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insights into the abnormal hematopoietic and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight potential therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The SAR-CoV-2 virus has evolved to co-exist with human hosts, albeit at a substantial energetic cost resulting in post-infection neurological manifestations [Neuro-post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)] that significantly impact public health and economic productivity on a global scale. One of the main molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of Neuro-PASC, in individuals of all ages, is the formation and inadequate proteolysis/clearance of phase-separated amyloid crystalline aggregates—a hallmark feature of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders. Amyloidogenesis during viral infection and persistence is a natural, inevitable, protective defense response that is exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2. Acting as chemical catalyst, SARS-CoV-2 accelerates hydrophobic collapse and the heterogeneous nucleation of amorphous amyloids into stable β-sheet aggregates. The clearance of amyloid aggregates is most effective during slow wave sleep, when high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—a biphasic modulator of biomolecular condensates—and melatonin are available to solubilize amyloid aggregates for removal. The dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics by SARS-CoV-2, in particular fusion and fission homeostasis, impairs the proper formation of distinct mitochondrial subpopulations that can remedy challenges created by the diversion of substrates away from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis to support viral replication and maintenance. The subsequent reduction of ATP and inhibition of melatonin synthesis during slow wave sleep results in incomplete brain clearance of amyloid aggregates, leading to the development of neurological manifestations commonly associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Exogenous melatonin not only prevents mitochondrial dysfunction but also elevates ATP production, effectively augmenting the solubilizing effect of the adenosine moiety to ensure the timely, optimal disaggregation and clearance of pathogenic amyloid aggregates in the prevention and attenuation of Neuro-PASC.">

However, these models are limited in their ability to recapitulate the complex structure of the human airway or the full spectrum of disease symptoms observed in humans. Recently, nose and lung organoids have revolutionized culture complexity in infection biology and have demonstrated potential for research on respiratory virus infections in humans. In this opinion, we review how advances in human nose and lung organoid models, which are able to express all cell types of the respiratory epithelia, i.e., Club, basal, goblet, and ciliated cells, have provided novel insight into the pathogenesis, age-dependent susceptibility, viral attenuation signature, and immune mechanisms of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. The models have also demonstrated potential for studying hitherto uncultivable human viruses and to be useful for studies of zoonotic risk.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is an emerging respiratory virus that commonly causes mild to severe respiratory diseases. EV-D68 infection is also associated with extra-respiratory complications, especially acute flaccid myelitis. However, how the virus invades the central nervous system (CNS) and infects motor neurons is not fully understood. One possible neuroinvasive route is through infection of skeletal muscles, which allows the virus to infect motor neurons via the neuromuscular junction. However, we hypothesise that direct EV-D68 infection of human skeletal muscles can impair muscle function and thus contribute to the development of EV-D68-associated muscle weakness. Here, we inoculated human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived skeletal muscle myotubes grown in 2D with different EV-D68 isolates, which resulted in a productive infection and cell death. We showed, through neuraminidase treatment, that sialic acids facilitate infection of these cells. EV-D68 infection of 3D tissue engineered skeletal muscles led to tissue damage, reduction of contractile force and depletion of muscle and satellite cells. Altogether, we showed that human skeletal muscle can act as an extra-respiratory replication site and infection of skeletal muscles may contribute to EV-D68-associated muscle weakness. Author summary After causing a global outbreak in 2014, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) - a respiratory virus - has been associated with polio-like paralysis. How the virus spreads from the respiratory system to the central nervous system is poorly understood. One of the possible routes for this spread is by infecting skeletal muscles before spreading to motor neurons. However, it is not known whether the virus can infect human skeletal muscles and whether EV-D68 infection of skeletal muscles can also lead to paralysis. Here, we used 2D and 3D human skeletal muscle models to investigate EV-D68 infection of human skeletal muscles. We found that EV-D68 can replicate in these 2D and 3D models and the infection results in destruction of muscle fibres and loss of muscle function. We also found that the infection results in loss of satellite cells, which are important for muscle regeneration, suggesting that EV-D68 infection hampers skeletal muscle regeneration. Our study provides new insights into the potential role of human skeletal muscles in EV-D68-associated paralysis.">

        <tr id="Sjögren’s disease (SjD) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disorder with significant clinical and molecular diversity. While anti-SSA antibodies serve as a hallmark serological biomarker, nearly half of patients lack them, raising fundamental questions about distinct pathogenic mechanisms. To address this, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing with surface protein profiling on 1.5 million PBMCs from 333 participants in the Sjögren’s International Collaborative Clinical Alliance cohort, comparing those with and without SjD and stratifying them by anti-SSA status. Our analysis identified two immunologically distinct subtypes of SjD, with SSA-positive patients exhibiting a dominant and persistent IFN-I signature, profoundly impacting immune cell maturation. Notably, transitional B cells were disproportionately affected, displaying signs of premature maturation, reduced BCR diversity, and shorter CDR3 regions, reinforced interactions with proinflammatory cells, thereby fostering an environment conducive to autoreactivity. By contrast, SSA-negative SjD participants lacked an upregulated IFN-I signature, challenging prevailing pathogenic models and suggesting alternative immune dysregulation pathways. These findings support a two-disease model of SjD and highlight transitional B cells as both a key biomarker and a potential therapeutic target. Targeting IFN-I signaling and transitional B cell maturation may represent a novel therapeutic avenue to modulate immune dysregulation and prevent autoreactivity in SjD.">

        <tr id="Approximately four months after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection, around 25% of individuals developed visuoconstructive deficit (VCD), which was found to be correlated with an increase in peripheral immune markers and alterations in structural and metabolic brain imaging. Recently, it has been demonstrated that supplemental vitamin B12 regulates hyperinflammation during moderate and severe COVID-19 through methyl-dependent epigenetic mechanisms. Herein, whole peripheral blood cultures were produced using samples obtained from patients with confirmed persistent VCD, and controls without impairment, between 10 and 16 months after mild COVID-19. This experimental model was used to assess the leukocyte expression patterns of 11 biomarkers previously associated with VCD in long COVID and explore the potential of pharmacological B12 in regulating these genes. The results showed that patients with persistent VCD displayed continued upregulation of CCL11 and LIF compared to controls. It is worth noting that elevated serum levels of CCL11 have been previously linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, the addition of 1 nM of vitamin B12 to blood cultures from individuals with VCD normalized the mRNA levels of CCL11, upregulated the neuroprotective HGF, and, to a lesser extent, downregulated CSF2 and CXCL10. There was an inverse correlation observed between CCL11 mRNA levels and methylation levels of specific cytosines in its promoter region. These findings underscore the significance of systemic inflammation in persistent VCD associated with long COVID. Moreover, the study provides evidence suggesting that B12, acting as an epidrug, shows promise as a therapeutic approach for addressing this cognitive impairment.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly evolved into a pandemic around the world. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the epidemiology and seasonality of other traditional respiratory viruses, e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, etc. These traditional respiratory viruses have transmission mode and clinical symptoms similar to SARS-CoV-2 but may differ in clinical outcomes and management. Co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses have been reported in the literature but have shown mixed evidence in clinical outcomes. With SARS-CoV-2 evolving into mild Omicron variants, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, which in turn affect the epidemiology and clinical course of respiratory viral infections. In response to these changes, multiplex molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses are attracting more attention in the field and have been developed into a variety of testing modalities. In this review, we describe the seasonality (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere), epidemiology, and clinical significance of traditional respiratory viruses and their co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the post-COVID era. Furthermore, we review commonly used multiplex molecular tests and their applications for the detection of respiratory viruses and their co-infections. Altogether, this review not only sheds light on the epidemiology and clinical significance of respiratory viral infections and co-infections in the post-COVID era, and but also provides insights into the laboratory-based diagnoses of respiratory viral infections using multiplex molecular testing.">

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has varied presentations from asymptomatic to death. Efforts to identify factors responsible for differential COVID-19 severity include but are not limited to genome wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptomic analysis. More recently, variability in host epigenomic profiles have garnered attention, providing links to disease severity. However, whole epigenome analysis of the respiratory tract, the target tissue of SARS-CoV-2, remains ill-defined. Results We interrogated the nasal methylome to identify pathophysiologic drivers in COVID-19 severity through whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of nasal samples from COVID-19 positive individuals with severe and mild presentation of disease. We noted differential DNA methylation in intergenic regions and low methylated regions (LMRs), demonstrating the importance of distal regulatory elements in gene regulation in COVID-19 illness. Additionally, we demonstrated differential methylation of pathways implicated in immune cell recruitment and function, and the inflammatory response. We found significant hypermethylation of the FUT4 promoter implicating impaired neutrophil adhesion in severe disease. We also identified hypermethylation of ELF5 binding sites suggesting downregulation of ELF5 targets in the nasal cavity as a factor in COVID-19 phenotypic variability. Conclusions This study demonstrated DNA methylation as a marker of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with enhancer-like elements playing significant roles. It is difficult to discern whether this differential methylation is a predisposing factor to severe COVID-19, or if methylation differences occur in response to disease severity. These differences in the nasal methylome may contribute to disease severity, or conversely, the nasal immune system may respond to severe infection through differential immune cell recruitment and immune function, and through differential regulation of the inflammatory response.

A better understanding of the immune responses contributing to disease heterogeneity is critical for improving asthma management. T cells are major players in the orchestration of asthma, in both mild and severe disease, but it is unclear whether specific T cell subsets influence asthma symptom duration. Here we show a significant association of airway CD8+ effector memory T cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRAs), but not CD8+ CD45RO+ or tissue resident memory (TRM) T cells, with asthma duration in patients with severe asthma (SA) but not mild to moderate asthma (MMA). Higher frequencies of IFN-γ+ CD8+ TEMRAs compared to IFN-γ+ CD45RO+ T cells were detected in SA airways, and the TEMRAs from SA but not MMA patients proliferated ex vivo, although both expressed cellular senescence-associated biomarkers. Prompted by the transcriptomic profile of SA CD8+ TEMRAs and proliferative response to IL-15, airway IL15 expression measured higher in SA compared to MMA patients. IL15 expression in asthmatic airways negatively correlated with lung function.

        <tr id="CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. While most infected people experienced mild illness, others progressed to severe disease, characterized by hyperinflammation and respiratory distress. There is still much to learn about the innate immune response to this virus. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor that is activated when pattern recognition receptors detect viruses. Upon activation, IRF3 induces the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) and interferon-stimulated genes, which protect the host from viral infection. However, coronaviruses antagonize this pathway, delaying type 1 IFN production. It is, therefore, unclear how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. Our prior reports showed that IRF3 promotes harmful inflammation during bacterial sepsis in mice. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that IRF3 cannot effectively control the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and instead promotes harmful inflammation during severe COVID-19. METHODS AND MODELS: We used mice transgenic for the human angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 transgene, driven by the keratin 18 promoter (K18-ACE2 mice) that were IRF3 deficient or IRF3 sufficient to test how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, K18-ACE2 mice showed a dose-dependent disease, characterized by mortality, lethargy, weight loss, and lung pathology, reminiscent of clinical COVID-19. However, K18-ACE2 mice lacking IRF3 were protected from severe disease with reduced mortality (84.6% vs. 100%) and disease score. We found that IRF3 promoted IFN-β production in the lungs and reprogrammed the cytokine profile, while viral load in the lungs was similar in the presence or absence of IRF3. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that IRF3 played a detrimental role in murine COVID-19 associated with changes in IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines.">

        <tr id="Excessive inflammation and cytokine release are hallmarks of severe COVID-19. Certain programmed cell death processes can drive inflammation, however, their role in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is unclear. Pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of regulated cell death initiated by inflammasomes and executed by the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). Using an established mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus and a panel of gene-targeted mice we found that deletion of the inflammasome (NLRP1/3 and the adaptor ASC) and pore forming proteins involved in pyroptosis (GSDMA/C/D/E) only marginally reduced IL-1β levels and did not impact disease outcome or viral loads. Furthermore, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not trigger GSDMD activation in mouse lungs. Finally, we did not observe any difference between WT animals and mice with compound deficiencies in the pro-inflammatory initiator caspases (C1/11/12-/-). This indicates that the classical canonical and non-canonical pro-inflammatory caspases known to process and activate pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and GSDMD do not substantially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. However, the loss of IL-1β, but not the absence of IL-18, ameliorated disease and enhanced survival in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals compared to wildtype mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that IL-1β is an important factor contributing to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, but its release was largely independent of inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways.">

        <tr id="The progression of COVID-19 involves a sophisticated and intricate interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host’s immune response. The immune system employs both innate and adaptive mechanisms to combat infection. Innate immunity initiates the release of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the adaptive immune response involves CD4+ Th lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and CD8+ Tc cells. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), activating the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling pathway, a crucial component of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This pathway fulfills a dual function during infection. In the early phase of infection, the virus can suppress cGAS-STING signaling to avoid immune detection. However, in the late stages, the activation of this pathway may trigger excessive inflammation and tissue damage, exacerbating disease severity. Modulating the cGAS-STING pathway, whether through agonists like dimeric amidobenzimidazole (diABZI) or inhibitors targeting viral proteins, such as 3CLpro, for example, offers a promising approach for personalized therapy to control the immune response and mitigate severe inflammation, ultimately improving clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The two influenza B virus (FLUBV) lineages have continuously diverged from each other since the 1980s, with recent (post-2015) viruses exhibiting accelerated evolutionary rates. Emerging data from human studies and epidemiological models suggest that increased divergence in contemporary viruses may drive differential cross-protection, where infection with Yamagata lineage viruses provides limited immunity against Victoria lineage viruses. Here, we developed animal models to investigate the mechanisms behind asymmetric cross-protection between contemporary FLUBV lineages. Our results show that contemporary Victoria immunity provides robust cross-protection against the Yamagata lineage, whereas Yamagata immunity offers limited protection against the Victoria lineage. This differential cross-protection is driven by Victoria-elicited neuraminidase (NA)–specific antibodies, which show cross-lineage reactivity, unlike those from Yamagata infections. These findings identify a phenomenon in contemporary FLUBV that may help explain the recent disappearance of the Yamagata lineage from circulation, highlighting the crucial role of targeting NA in vaccination strategies to enhance cross-lineage FLUBV protection.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is widely posited to be a key pathogenic mechanism linking acute organophosphate (OP)-induced status epilepticus (SE) to persistent brain injury and abnormal electrical activity that contribute to epilepsy and cognitive impairment. The plasminogen activation system (PAS) promotes neuroinflammation in diverse neurological diseases but whether it is activated following acute OP intoxication has yet to be evaluated. To address this data gap, we characterized the spatiotemporal expression patterns of multiple components of the PAS in a rat model of acute intoxication with the OP, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Adult male Sprague Dawley rats administered DFP (4 mg/kg, sc), atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, im) and 2-pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, im) went into SE that persisted for hours. One day after acute DFP-induced SE, plasmin activity and protein concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the plasma were increased, though not significantly. In contrast, acute DFP intoxication significantly increased brain levels of PAI-1, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and transcripts of TGF-β in a time- and region-dependent manner. In the cortex and hippocampus, quantification of PAI-1, tPA, and uPA by ELISA indicated significantly increased levels at 1 day post-exposure (DPE). PAI-1 and uPA returned to control values by 7 DPE while tPA protein remained elevated at 28 DPE. Immunohistochemistry detected elevated PAI-1 expression in the DFP brain up to 28 DPE. Co-localization of PAI-1 with biomarkers of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes demonstrated that PAI-1 localized predominantly to a subpopulation of astrocytes. Cytologically, PAI-1 localized to astrocytic end feet, but not adjacent neurovascular endothelium. Electron microscopy revealed neuronal metabolic stress and neurodegeneration with disruption of adjacent neurovascular units in the hippocampus post-DFP exposure. These data indicate that acute DFP intoxication altered PAS expression in the brain, with aberrant PAI-1 expression in a subset of reactive astrocyte populations.

        <tr id="Encephalitic alphaviruses, including eastern, Venezuelan, and western equine encephalitis virus (EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV, respectively) are New World alphaviruses primarily transmitted by mosquitos that cause debilitating and lethal central nervous system (CNS) disease in both humans and horses. Despite over one hundred years of research on these viruses, the underpinnings of the molecular mechanisms driving virally induced damage to the CNS remain unresolved. Moreover, virally induced encephalitis following exposure to these viruses causes catastrophic damage to the CNS, and survivors of infection often suffer from permanent neurological sequelae as a result of sustained neuroinflammation and neurological insults encountered. Animal models are undoubtedly invaluable tools in biomedical research, where physiologically relevant models are required to study pathogenesis and host–pathogen interactions. Here, we review the literature to examine nonhuman primate (NHP) and mouse models of infection for EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV. We provide a brief overview of relevant background information for each virus, including geography, epidemiology, and clinical disease. The primary focus of this review is to describe neuropathological features associated with CNS disease in NHP and mouse models of infection and compare CNS invasion and neuropathogenesis for aerosol, intranasal, and subcutaneous routes of exposure to EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV.">

 Natural killer (NK) cells are crucial constituents of innate immunity, playing a vital role in the early defense against viral infections and cancer. Their antiviral capabilities stem from direct cytotoxic activity against infected cells and immunoregulatory functions that modulate adaptive immune responses. In the context of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), NK cells contribute to controlling viral replication and limiting excessive inflammatory responses.



 This review highlights the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity, focusing on their interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). We discuss potential sources of NK cells for adoptive transfer therapy, critical factors influencing their therapeutic efficacy, and considerations for clinical translation in COVID-19 treatment.



 Various NK cell sources for adoptive therapy are discussed, including peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetically engineered NK cells. Key factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NK cell-based therapies are analyzed, including cytokine modulation, NK cell subset selection, and delivery methods.



 Understanding the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity and the factors that influence the success of adoptive NK cell therapy can inform the design of more effective immunotherapies for COVID-19 patients. Strategies for improving NK cell function, such as genetic modification and optimizing therapy protocols, are highlighted to enhance therapeutic outcomes.



 NK cells neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by releasing cytotoxic granules, inhibiting replication, and modulating inflammation. They originate from peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetic engineering. Therapeutic strategies include adoptive transfer, cytokine modulation, and optimized delivery. Inflammation is controlled, reducing excessive immune responses.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Co‐infection with HIV and SARS‐CoV‐2 presents a complex clinical picture. Deciphering the immune response in this population, particularly the role of cytokines underlying immunopathogenesis could elucidates the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Methods This prospective, two‐stage study enrolled 75 individuals with HIV diagnosed with COVID‐19 (case group) and 25 individuals from the general population infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 only (control group). COVID‐19 diagnosis followed World Health Organization guidelines. Plasma cytokine levels were measured using a cytokine bead array. Results The case group skewed slightly females (61.2% vs. 42.9% female in the control group) an average age of 3 years older (44.13 years vs. 40.86 years). Importantly, all the case group participants had mild complications, while a significant majority (88.1%) in the control group experienced severe complications. The control group displayed a substantially higher IgM titer 963 IU/mL compared to only 39.3 IU/mL in the case group. The control group had significantly higher levels of IL‐6, IL‐10, IFN‐γ, TNF‐α compared to the case group. Conclusion This study suggests a potentially distinct immune response in HIV‐positive patients when infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Elucidating these differences could lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.">

        <tr id="Animal models are indispensable for unraveling the mechanisms underlying post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). This review evaluates recent research on PASC-related perturbations in animal models, drawing comparisons with clinical findings. Despite the limited number of studies on post-COVID conditions, particularly those extending beyond three months, these studies provide valuable insights. Three hallmark features of PASC—lung fibrosis, hyperglycemia, and neurological sequelae—have been successfully replicated in animal models, paving the way for mechanistic discoveries and future medical interventions. Although most studies have reported post-COVID conditions within 14–60 days post-infection, they still offer critical reference for future long-term research. This review also explores potential mechanisms of persisting immune misfiring, a key factor in the chronicity of PASC symptoms. Moreover, challenges in modeling PASC are also discussed, including the limited genetic diversity in inbred animal strains and difficulties in accurately identifying PASC-affected individuals. To address these issues, we propose methodological improvements, such as comparing individual animal parameters with control averages and incorporating genetically diverse populations like collaborative cross models. These strategies will enhance the identification and characterization of PASC endotypes in animal studies. By integrating findings from animal models with clinical manifestations of PASC, future research can provide more valuable insights into its mechanisms and support the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need for longitudinal studies in animal models to fully uncover the mechanisms driving PASC and guide interventions to mitigate its public health impact.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 infection has been responsible of COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) pandemia and can cause a variety of symptoms including gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal pain and liver injury. The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is expressed in gut and SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce vascular damage and immune system dysregulation, creating an inflammatory and hypercoagulable state, as widely described at the lung level. Case presentation This work presents the case of a middle-aged Caucasian man admitted to the Hospital Emergency Department from the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy), complaining of pain in the upper and middle region of the abdomen. The patient tested negative to the nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks after recovering from viral infection. The patient required resection of a segment of ileum and an ulcer of the bowel wall was recognized and sampled. Previous published results had confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, an increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) and an altered morphology of microvilli in the ulcerated ileum of the patient when compared to the non-ulcerated ileum. The present study sought to deepen the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, we evaluated the expression and co-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibronectin by immunohistochemical techniques. VEGF immunohistochemical expression was higher in the ulcer than in the control ileum sample and the non-ulcerated ileum areas and co-expressed with the SPIKE protein. Fibronectin staining was lower in control sample than in non-ulcerated and ulcerated ileum. Electron microscopy analysis showed alterations of the integrity of the intestinal barrier in the ulcerated area when compared to the non-ulcerated ileum or to the control sample. Conclusions Although the patient was tested negative to nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, the SPIKE protein was detected in his terminal ileum, especially in the ulcerated areas. The presence of the viral protein was also associated with an increase of VEGF and Fibronectin. In addition to vascular changes, the SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the junctional apparatus among epithelial cells, making the tissue even more fragile and thus susceptible to the entry of pathogens and the development of further infections.">

        <tr id="Long COVID has emerged as a significant challenge since the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared as an outbreak in March 2020, marked by diverse symptoms and prolonged duration of disease. Defined by the WHO as symptoms persisting or emerging for at least two months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection without an alternative cause, its prevalence varies globally, with estimates of 10–20% in Europe, 7.3% in the USA, and 3.0% in the UK. The condition’s etiology remains unclear, involving factors, such as renin–angiotensin system overactivation, persistent viral reservoirs, immune dysregulation, and autoantibodies. Reactivated viruses, like EBV and HSV-6, alongside epigenetic alterations, exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and energy imbalance. Emerging evidence links SARS-CoV-2 to chromatin and gut microbiome changes, further influencing long-term health impacts. Diagnosis of long COVID requires detailed systemic evaluation through medical history and physical examination. Management is highly individualized, focusing mainly on the patient’s symptoms and affected systems. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, integrating diverse perspectives to address systemic manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Enhanced understanding of long COVID’s pathophysiology and clinical features is critical to improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

Understanding the demographic, clinical, and immunological differences between individuals with and without long COVID-19 is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This observational study included 206 participants, comprising 90 patients with long COVID-19 and 116 without. Data on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were collected, alongside immune cell profiles and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Statistical analyses compared these parameters between the two groups. Long COVID-19 patients were predominantly female (77.8%), older (47.78% aged 41–60, 20% >60 years), and had higher BMI, hypertension (31.1%), and autoimmune diseases (11.1%) compared to nonlong COVID-19 individuals (P < 0.001). Clinical symptoms unique to long COVID-19 included memory loss (40.0%), hair loss (37.8%), fatigue (35.6%), and myalgia/arthralgia (28.9%), all absent in the control group (P < 0.001). Immunologically, patients with long COVID-19 exhibited distinct immune profiles, including elevated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+), reduced B cells, and higher CD4/CD8 ratios. Moreover, long COVID-19 patients had higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, with 15.5% showing levels between 1000–2500 BAU/ml, compared to 6.9% in controls. These immunological biomarkers, including altered T cell subsets and antibody levels, highlight the complex immune dysregulation associated with long COVID-19. These findings could inform future clinical management and therapeutic strategies targeting immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bats are reservoirs for multiple viruses, some of which are known to cause global disease outbreaks. Virus spillovers from bats have been implicated in zoonotic transmission. Some bat species can tolerate viral infections, such as infections with coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses, better than humans and with less clinical consequences. Bat species are speculated to have evolved alongside these viral pathogens, and adaptations within the bat immune system are considered to be associated with viral tolerance. Inflammation and cell death in response to zoonotic virus infections prime human immunopathology. Unlike humans, bats have evolved adaptations to mitigate virus infection-induced inflammation. Inflammatory cell death pathways such as necroptosis and pyroptosis are associated with immunopathology during virus infections, but their regulation in bats remains understudied. This review focuses on the regulation of inflammation and cell death pathways in bats. We also provide a perspective on the possible contribution of cell death-regulating proteins, such as caspases and gasdermins, in modulating tissue damage and inflammation in bats. Understanding the role of these adaptations in bat immune responses can provide valuable insights for managing future disease outbreaks, addressing human disease severity, and improving pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="Since SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented changes in the epidemiology of other infectious diseases, investigations on coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and one of the famous vector-borne diseases, malaria, are crucial for disease control, especially in malaria-endemic areas. The clinical profiles, possible mechanisms for interactions, and representative control measures of COVID-19 and malaria coinfections have recently garnered public attention. The overlap in epidemiology, infection incubation, and clinical symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria coinfections has been thoroughly discussed to provide a detailed diagnostic procedure for coinfections, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions. Immunological and genetic evidence has shown that previous malaria exposure may protect the body from the poor prognosis of COVID-19. ACE2 downregulation and TLR-induced pathways play a role in this protective effect, as do CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell activation and coinhibitory receptor upregulation, which help maintain a balance of immune reactions. Finally, multiple control measures for coinfections were discussed, and malaria control efforts were enriched in the context of COVID-19. These efforts included (1) developing vaccinations; (2) evaluating the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment; (3) exploring recent advances in natural products that are potentially useful for coinfection treatment; (4) researching and implementing bioinsecticides for malaria control, such as gene-driven mosquitoes, fungi, and bacterial symbionts; and (5) improving national electronic disease surveillance platforms in malaria-endemic regions. At last, the above findings summarized valuable lessons about malaria and COVID-19 control and expedite further investigations on coinfections with complex clinical presentations.

        <tr id="Background Severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by an excessive presence of neutrophils. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), released by activated neutrophils due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, contribute to lung epithelial cell death and are key drivers in COVID-19-associated immunothrombosis. However, the mechanism underlying NET formation in COVID-19 remain unclear. Methods Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from the serum of COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers, while neutrophils were isolated from blood samples of healthy volunteers. Neutrophils were treated with EVs, and the formation of NETs was observed. To identify the components responsible for the COVID-19-EVs-induced NET formation, we analyzed the expression profiles of microRNA (miRNAs) in COVID-19-EVs. We identified eight highly expressed miRNAs in COVID-19-EVs and explored their potential roles in COVID-19-EVs-mediated NET formation. Additionally, we explored the role of miR-20b-5p in COVID-19-EVs-induced NET formation. Results In this study, we demonstrate that patients with COVID-19 have a higher concentration of serum EVs (COVID-19-EVs) than healthy controls (Normal-EVs). We also found that COVID-19-EVs are internalized by neutrophils to induced NET formation. Through comprehensive miRNA profiling of COVID-19-EVs versus Normal-EVs, we identified 78 differentially expressed miRNAs, with 27 of these being upregulated and 51 being downregulated. Subsequently, we discovered that COVID-19-EVs that were highly abundant with certain miRNAs promote NET formation. Specifically, miR-20b-5p was found to be the strongest inducer of NET formation of the identified miRNAs. Inhibition of miR-20b-5p resulted in a significant decrease in COVID-19-EVs-mediated induction of NET formation. Conclusion Herein, we reveal a previously unknown role of COVID-19-EVs in NET formation, which contributes to COVID-19 progression. This study suggests that miR-20b-5p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment.

        <tr id="Background: The coronavirus–caused disease (COVID-19), first identified in China in December 2019, has spread worldwide becoming a global pandemic. Although people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus presented mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, an increase in cardiovascular incidents was observed in several scientific studies. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to disrupt the normal immune response leading to a dysregulation of immune system function and massive production of inflammatory cytokines commonly known as “cytokine storm”. Methods: 57 patients eventually participated in the study, assigned to non–COVID (24 patients) and COVID (33 patients) groups. After signing consent to participate in the study, each patient was given a self–administered questionnaire to fill out prior to specimen collection, anthropometric measurements were taken and venous blood was collected for the following determinations: pro- and anti–inflammatory cytokines using a Bio–Plex 200 system, oxidative stress markers and basic hematological blood parameters. Results: showed statistically significant higher values of IL–1Ra and IL–1β in the COVID-19 group. Of the oxidative stress markers, only MDA levels were higher in the COVID-19 group. Conclusions: the results of our study provide evidence and support the occurrence of elevated levels of IL–1Ra, IL–1β and MDA in the COVID-19 group of patients, which are associated with a worse course and prognosis of COVID-19. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and dysregulation of the immune system associated with the cytokine storm is essential to select patients at risk and develop effective drugs and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading infectious causes of death worldwide. Persistent bacterial populations in specific microenvironments within the host hamper efficient TB chemotherapy. Caseum in the necrotic core of closed granulomas and cavities of pulmonary TB patients can harbor high burdens of drug‐tolerant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacilli, making them particularly difficult to sterilize. Here, we describe protocols for the generation of a surrogate matrix using lipid‐rich macrophages to mimic the unique composition of caseum in vivo. Importantly, this caseum surrogate induces metabolic and physiological changes within MTB that reproduce the nonreplicating drug‐tolerant phenotype of the pathogen in the native caseous environment, making it advantageous over alternative in vitro models of nonreplicating persistent (NRP) MTB. The protocols include culture of THP‐1 monocytes, stimulation of lipid droplet accumulation, lysis and denaturation of the foamy macrophages, inoculation and preadaptation of MTB bacilli in the caseum surrogate, and evaluation of drug bactericidal activity against the NRP population. This novel in vitro model is being used to screen for potent bactericidal antimicrobial agents and to identify vulnerable drug targets, among a variety of other applications, thereby reducing our reliance on in vivo models. © 2025 The Author(s).

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combination with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a devastating autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) with limited treatment options. Several studies have shown attenuation of the well-characterized GBS preclinical experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) model with systemically administered therapeutic compounds via anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory mechanisms. Despite this, clinical advancement of these findings is limited by dosing that is not translatable to humans or is associated with off-target and toxic effects. This is due, in part, to the blood-nerve barrier (BNB), which restricts access of the circulation to peripheral nerves. However, during acute neuroinflammation, the normally restrictive BNB exhibits increased vascular permeability and enables immune cell infiltration. This may offer a unique window to access the otherwise restricted peripheral nerve microenvironment for therapeutic delivery. Here, we assessed the degree to which BNB permeability and immune cell infiltration over the course of EAN enables accumulation of circulating nanoparticles. We found that at disease stages defined by distinct clinical scores and pathology (onset, effector phase, and peak of EAN severity), intravenously administered small molecules and nanoparticles ranging from 50 to 150 nm can permeate into the endoneurium from the endoneurial vasculature in a size- and stage-dependent manner. This permeation occurs uniformly in both sciatic nerves and in proximal and distal regions of the nerves. We propose that this nerve targeting enabled by pathology serves as a platform by which potential therapies for GBS can be reevaluated and investigated preclinically in nanoparticle delivery systems.">

        <tr id="La Crosse virus (LACV) is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in the U.S., primarily affecting children under 16 years. Despite severe morbidity and potential mortality risks, no vaccines or antivirals exist. Murine models recapitulate human susceptibility patterns, with weanling mice (3 weeks old) succumbing to disease while adults (≥8 weeks old) exhibit resistance. We characterized the T cell responses underlying this difference. Adult mice mounted robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses by 6 days post-infection (dpi), with sustained IFN-γ, granzyme B, IL-2, and TNF-α production. These T cells expanded significantly and exhibited in vivo cytotoxicity against cells pulsed with LACV glycoprotein (Gc) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens. In contrast, weanlings showed weak T cell responses and 100% mortality by 7 dpi. Immunization with LFn-LACV-Gc and -N improved T cell cytotoxicity and survival in weanlings, highlighting their potential as vaccines. These findings inform strategies to mitigate LACV-induced encephalitis in children.">

        <tr id="Asthma has long been associated with increased susceptibility to viral respiratory infections, leading to significant exacerbations and poorer clinical outcomes. Contrarily and interestingly, emerging data and research surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that patients with asthma infected with SARS-CoV-2 experienced decreased severity of disease, lower hospitalization rates, as well as decreased morbidity and mortality. Research has shown that eosinophils could enhance immune defense against viral infections, while inhaled corticosteroids can assist in controlling systematic inflammation. Moreover, reduced ACE-2 expression in individuals with asthma may restrict viral entry, and the Th2 immune response may offset the Th1 response typically observed in severe COVID-19 patients. These factors may help explain the favorable outcomes seen in asthmatic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review highlights potential protective mechanisms seen in asthmatic patients, including eosinophilia, the use of inhaled corticosteroids, reduced ACE-2 expression, and a dominate Th2 immune response. Such a study will be helpful to better manage patients with asthma who have contracted COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious and severe infectious disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). The disease significantly threatens the sustainable development of the global pig industry. Unfortunately, to date, no safe and efficacious vaccines are commercially available except in Vietnam. Antioxidative stress is a critical factor in antiviral strategies. In this study, we show that ASFV infection elevates the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppresses the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, overexpressing Nrf2 can significantly inhibit ASFV replication. Through high-throughput screening of natural small molecules against ASFV, we identify resveratrol (RES), an Nrf2 activator, as a compound capable of inducing the cellular antiviral responses and effectively inhibiting ASFV replication in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Notably, untargeted metabolomics profiling reveals that glutathione emerges as a primary differential metabolite related to the antiviral activities of RES against ASFV. Mechanistically, RES exerts its antiviral effects and attenuates the elevated level of ROS caused by ASFV infection by inducing the production of reduced glutathione (GSH) via the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, RES exhibits broad efficacy as a potentially effective compound for inhibiting ASFV infection and alleviating the oxidative stress induced by ASFV infection via the Nrf2 signaling pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 is an oral pathogen that infects and replicates in mucosal and salivary epithelial cells, contributing to oral post‐acute sequelae COVID‐19 (PASC) and other oral and non‐oral pathologies. While pre‐existing inflammatory oral diseases provides a conducive environment for the virus, acute infection and persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 can also results in oral microbiome dysbiosis that further worsens poor oral mucosal health. Indeed, oral PASC includes periodontal diseases, dysgeusia, xerostomia, pharyngitis, oral keratoses, and pulpitis suggesting significant bacterial contributions to SARS‐CoV‐2 and oral tissue tropism. Dysbiotic microbiome‐induced inflammation can promote viral entry via angiotensin‐converting enzyme receptor‐2 (ACE2), serine transmembrane TMPRSS2 and possibly other non‐canonical pathways. Additionally, metabolites derived from a dysbiotic microbiome can alter the physiological and biochemical pathways related to the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This may promote a pro‐inflammatory microenvironment, leading to immune exhaustion, loss of tolerance, and susceptibility to a variety of oral pathogens, causing acute and later chronic inflammation. Microbial release of mimics of host metallopeptidases related to furin, ADAM17 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17), and glycoprotein metabolites can further aid viral attachment to T cell immunoglobulin‐like (TIMs), enhancing viral entry while simultaneously depressing oral mucosal immune resistance and clearance. Membrane reorganization characterised by neuroproteins, such as neuropilins, also functionally assists with SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and extends the pathogenesis of PASC from the oral cavity to the brain, gut, or other non‐oral tissues. Thus, poor oral health, characterised by disrupted oral microbiomes can promote viral tropism, weaken antiviral resistance, and heightens susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This immune dysfunction also increases the risk of additional viral infections, exacerbating oral conditions like periodontal and endodontic diseases. These persistent oral health issues can contribute to systemic inflammation, creating bidirectional effects between oral and non‐oral tissues, potentially leading to Post‐Acute Sequelae of COVID‐19 (PASC).">

        <tr id="T-cell ageing may be a key factor in the disproportionate severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older populations. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients, treatment involving the use of monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 usually involves the administration of high doses but has not been very effective at preventing complications or fatality, highlighting the need for additional research into anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, particularly for older populations. In this study, it is discovered that older persons with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has weaker T-cell responses. Therefore the development and characterization of spike-targeting T-cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) full-length human immunoglobulin Gs with enhanced efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is described. Using S-targeting TDBs, polyclonal T cells are guided to target and destroy S-expressing cells, preventing the cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby eliminating the need for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Using animal models of COVID-19, it is shown that the selective activation of T cells improves the efficiency of treatment in preinfected mice by attenuating disease-induced weight loss and death. The significance of T-cell-based immunity during infection is highlighted by the findings. These results have implications for better clinical effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 and the development of T-cell-dependent medicines for the elderly population.">

        <tr id="Cellular innate immune pathways are formidable barriers against viral invasion, creating an environment unfavorable for virus replication. Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in driving and regulating these cell-intrinsic innate antiviral mechanisms through the action of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The host IFN response obstructs viral replication at every stage, prompting viruses to evolve various strategies to counteract or evade this response. Understanding the interplay between viral proteins and cell-intrinsic IFN-mediated immune mechanisms is essential for developing antiviral and anti-inflammatory strategies. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses, encode a range of proteins that, through shared and distinct mechanisms, inhibit IFN-mediated innate immune responses. Compounding the issue, a dysregulated early IFN response can lead to a hyper-inflammatory immune reaction later in the infection, resulting in severe disease. This review provides a brief overview of HCoV replication and a detailed account of its interaction with host cellular innate immune pathways regulated by IFN.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection spread rapidly from China around the world, causing the worst pandemic since the beginning of the 21st century. Although the disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has multiple organ symptoms, the main pathological lesions occur in the lung, causing respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, secondary bacterial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. Despite the best efforts of researchers, the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular and tissue damage in organs and systems is poorly understood. Therefore, in our study, we aimed to highlight the pulmonary lesions and their extent, which could explain the complex symptomatology presented by patients who died with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study was performed on a number of 36 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who died under legally suspicious conditions, requiring autopsy within the Romanian Forensic Medicine Institutes. All patients presented a local inflammatory reaction of pneumonic type, with exudative and proliferative phenomena, with intra-alveolar and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates formed by lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophilic granulocytes, with congested or ruptured blood vessels with intra-alveolar or interstitial hemorrhages, with multiple thrombosis, with proliferation of local fibroblasts transformed into myofibroblasts and presence of granulation tissue that remodeled the entire lung parenchyma.">

        <tr id="The novel H10N3 avian influenza virus (AIV) has infected four individuals since 2021 and caused severe respiratory damage, posing a significant threat to public health. However, its pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our findings revealed that H10N3 infection induces severe lung damage and causes death in mice, even at low doses. The elevated levels of multiple pro-inflammatory factors in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly increased during infection, displaying hallmarks of a cytokine storm. Transcriptome sequencing further revealed systematic activation of inflammation-related pathways, predicting that viral infection induces multiple forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. Protein-level validation showed that the activation of key cell death markers, including Caspase-3, GSDMD, and MLKL, significantly increased as the infection progressed, with their dynamic changes correlating strongly with the expression pattern of viral proteins. This study elucidates the central role of the synergistic effect between the cytokine storm and multiple cell death pathways in H10N3 pathogenesis. These findings not only advance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AIVs but also provide a critical theoretical basis for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Schistosomiasis affects over 250 million people, predominantly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Schistosoma-endemic regions a lack of natural sterilizing immunity means individual are repeatedly infected, treated and reinfected. Due to difficulties in tracking infection in endemic areas, the kinetics of the host immune response during these reinfections have not been elucidated. Here, we use repeated (3x) controlled human Schistosoma mansoni (Sm) infection (repeated CHI) to directly study how antigen-specific T cells develop during reinfection. We compared these responses to natural Sm-infected endemic Ugandan individuals. We report that a mixed Th1/Th2/regulatory CD4+ T cell response develops in repeated CHI, primarily against adult worm antigens. Adult worm-specific responses after repeated CHI were similar to those observed in naturally infected endemic participants. However, endemic participants showed differential responses to antigens from egg and cercariae life-cycle stages. Repeated CHI (3x) with sequential exposure to Sm cercariae of different sexes (male-fmeale-male) revealed an elevated CD4+ T cell cyotkine response to adult worm and egg antigens. Our findings demonstrate that reinfection with single-sex schistosomes elicits adult worm-specific T cell cytokine responses that reflect endemic-natural infection, highlighting the translatability of the CHI model to natural infection in endemic settings. Overall, this study advances our understanding of how schistosome immune responses develop over reinfection cycles in the human host, thereby increasing our understanding of the immunology of natural schistosome (re)infection.">

        <tr id="Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of bronchiolitis in children under the age of five. RSV infection proceeds by fusion of the viral envelope with the target cell membrane, but it is unclear whether fusion occurs with plasma or endosomal membranes. Methods Entry and/or infection was studied in undifferentiated primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells. Synchronization of viral entry or infection was achieved by attaching the virus to the plasma membrane at temperatures of 4°C or 22°C. Cells in which entry events had occurred were identified by the enzymatic action of beta-lactamase M (BlaM) fused to the RSV P protein (BlaM-P) carried by rgRSV virions. BlaM cleaves the beta-lactam ring of CCF2 loaded into the cells, disrupting FRET and allowing blue light to be emitted. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, encoded by the rgRSV genome, was used to identify infected cells. Results We found that adsorption of RSV at 4°C favors entry via endocytosis, whereas binding of the virus to the membrane at 22°C favors RSV entry via the plasma membrane. The induction of endocytosis by synchronization at 4°C is, therefore, an artifact. In addition, we found that all drugs that interfered with RSV infection reduced cell membrane deformations such as filopodia and lamellipodia, suggesting a mechanism by which they may interfere with RSV fusion with the cell membrane. Discussion In conclusion, RSV enters the cell by direct fusion of its envelope with the plasma membrane.">

        <tr id="Infection with novel duck reovirus (NDRV) results in severe splenic necrosis, leading to immunosuppression, secondary infections with other pathogens, and impairment of the immune effect of the vaccine. However, little is known about NDRV-induced spleen injury and its antagonistic mechanism on the host immune response. In this study, we conducted pathological and comparative transcriptomic analyses of NDRV-infected duck spleens. Our findings elucidated the histopathological progression of splenic necrotic foci formation following NDRV infection and identified splenic macrophages as the primary target cells. RNA-Seq analysis revealed differentially expressed genes that were enriched predominantly in immune system processes, signalling molecules and interactions, and pathways related to cell growth and necrosis. Notably, we observed a significant upregulation of ferroptosis during NDRV infection, characterized by the induction of specific metabolism-related genes such as TfR1, Hmox1, and STEAP3, alongside the downregulation of Fpn expression. Our findings collectively indicate the involvement of ferroptosis in spleen injury induced by NDRV infection. Investigating the mechanism of NDRV-induced ferroptosis in spleen macrophages will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis associated with NDRV.

        <tr id="Leishmania infantum causes human Visceral Leishmaniasis and Leishmaniosis (CanL) in reservoir host, dogs. As infection progresses to disease in both humans and dogs there is a shift from controlling, Type 1, immunity to a regulatory, exhausted, T cell phenotype. In endemic areas, association between tickborne coinfections (TBC) and Leishmania diagnosis and/or clinical severity has been demonstrated. To identify immune factors correlating with disease progression, we prospectively evaluated a cohort of L. infantum infected dogs from 2019-2022. The cohort was TBC-negative with asymptomatic leishmaniosis at the time of enrollment. We measured TBC serology, anti-Leishmania antigen T cell immunity, CanL serological response, parasitemia, and disease severity to probe how nascent TBC perturbs the immune state. At the conclusion, TBC+ dogs with CanL experienced greater increases in anti-Leishmania antibody reactivity and parasite burden compared to dogs that did not have incident TBC during the study. TBC+ dogs were twice as likely to experience moderate (LeishVet stage 2) or severe/terminal disease (LeishVet stage 3/4). Prolonged exposure to TBC was associated with a shift in Leishmania antigen-induced IFNγ/IL-10 and enhanced CD8 T cell proliferation. Frequency of proliferating CD8 T cells significantly correlated with parasitemia and antibody reactivity. TBC exacerbated parasite burden and immune exhaustion. These findings highlight the need for combined vector control efforts as prevention programs for dogs in Leishmania endemic areas to reduce transmission to humans. Public health education efforts should aim to increase awareness of the connection between TBC and leishmaniosis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal disease with an unknown etiology and complex pathophysiology that are not fully understood. The disease involves intricate cellular interplay, particularly among various immune cells. Currently, there is no treatment capable of reversing the fibrotic process or aiding lung regeneration. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has demonstrated antifibrotic properties, whereas the adoptive transfer of modified T cells is a well‐established treatment for various malignancies. We aimed to understand the dynamics of T cells in the progression of lung fibrosis and to study the therapeutic benefit of adoptive T cell transfer in a bleomycin‐injured mouse lung (BLM) model. Methods T cells were isolated from the spleen of naïve mice and transfected in vitro with mouse HGF plasmid and were administered intratracheally to the mice lungs 7 days post‐bleomycin injury to the lung. Lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage were collected and analyzed using flow cytometry, histology, qRT‐PCR, ELISA, and hydroxyproline assay. Results Our findings demonstrate the successful T cell therapy of bleomycin‐induced lung injury through the adoptive transfer of HGF‐transfected T cells in mice. This treatment resulted in decreased collagen deposition and a balancing of immune cell exhaustion and cytokine homeostasis compared with untreated controls. In vitro testing showed enhanced apoptosis in myofibroblasts induced by HGF‐overexpressing T cells. Conclusions Taken together, our data highlight the great potential of adoptive T cell transfer as an emerging therapy to counteract lung fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Despite the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, there still remain risks of new aggressive strains of coronavirus. As the human population increases progressively, it is mandatory to ensure both preventive measures and an immediate response to emerging infectious threats. Another essential component for rapidly restraining a new possible pandemic is the development of new anticoronaviral therapeutics. In the present study, the anticoronaviral capabilities of Gc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF) are characterized. It is demonstrated that the administration of GcMAF to Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the first phase of infection (six days postinfection) is accompanied by (i) a statistically significant reduction in the viral load of the lung tissue and (ii) the switching of the inflammatory status of the lung tissue to a neutral one in terms of mRNA expression levels of the groups of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The potential mechanism for this antiviral action and the containment of the inflammatory response by the drug associated with the engagement of terminal N-acetylgalactosamine GcMAF and C-type lectin domain containing 10A expressed at the surface of lung-infiltrating macrophages and pneumocytes, which simultaneously express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is discussed.">

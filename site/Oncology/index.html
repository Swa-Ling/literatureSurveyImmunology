        <tr id="At this stage in the COVID-19 pandemic, most infections are "breakthrough" infections that occur in individuals with prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. To refine long-term vaccine strategies against emerging variants, we examined both innate and adaptive immunity in breakthrough infections. We performed single-cell transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional profiling of primary and breakthrough infections to compare immune responses from unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals during the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave. Breakthrough infections were characterized by a less activated transcriptomic profile in monocytes and natural killer cells, with induction of pathways limiting monocyte migratory potential and natural killer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed a female-specific increase in transcriptomic and proteomic activation of multiple innate immune cell subsets during breakthrough infections. These insights suggest that prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prevents overactivation of innate immune responses during breakthrough infections with discernible sex-specific patterns and underscore the potential of harnessing vaccines in mitigating pathologic immune responses resulting from overactivation.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is accompanied by elevated liver enzymes, and patients with pre‐existing liver conditions experience more severe disease. While it was known that SARS‐CoV‐2 infects human hepatocytes, our study determines the mechanism of infection, demonstrates viral replication and spread, and highlights direct hepatocyte damage. Viral replication was readily detectable upon infection of primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells with the ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2, Delta, and Omicron variants. Hepatocytes express the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor ACE2 and the host cell protease TMPRSS2, and knocking down ACE2 and TMPRSS2 impaired SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Progeny viruses released from infected hepatocytes showed the typical coronavirus morphology by electron microscopy and proved infectious when transferred to fresh cells, indicating that hepatocytes can contribute to virus spread. Importantly, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection rapidly induced hepatocyte death in a replication‐dependent fashion, with the Omicron variant showing faster onset but less extensive cell death. C57BL/6 wild‐type mice infected with a mouse‐adapted SARS‐CoV‐2 strain showed high levels of viral RNA in liver and lung tissues. ALT peaked when viral RNA was cleared from the liver. Liver histology revealed profound tissue damage and immune cell infiltration, indicating that direct cytopathic effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 and immune‐mediated killing of infected hepatocytes contribute to liver pathology.">

Single-cell transcriptomics has provided the scope of investigating cellular and molecular underpinnings of host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high resolution. In this review, we have systematically described the virus-induced dysregulation of relative abundance as well as molecular behavior of each innate and adaptive immune cell type and cell state during COVID-19 infection and for different vaccinations, based on single-cell studies published in last three-four years. Identification and characterization of these disease-associated specific cell populations might help to design better, efficient, and targeted therapeutic avenues.">

        <tr id="The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it critical to understand the immune and inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It became increasingly recognized that the immune response was a key mediator of illness severity and that its mechanisms needed to be better understood. Early infection of both tissue and immune cells, such as macrophages, leading to pyroptosis-mediated inflammasome production in an organ system critical for systemic oxygenation likely plays a central role in the morbidity wrought by SARS-CoV-2. Delayed transcription of Type I and Type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to early disinhibition of viral replication. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), some of which may be produced through mechanisms involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), likely contribute to the hyperinflammatory state in patients with severe COVID-19. Lymphopenia, more apparent among natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells, can contribute to disease severity and may reflect direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 or end-organ sequestration. Direct infection and immune activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may be a critical mechanism through which end-organ systems are impacted. In this context, endovascular neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and microthrombi development can be seen in the lungs and other critical organs throughout the body, such as the heart, gut, and brain. The kidney may be among the most impacted extrapulmonary organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to a high concentration of ACE2 and exposure to systemic SARS-CoV-2. In the kidney, acute tubular injury, early myofibroblast activation, and collapsing glomerulopathy in select populations likely account for COVID-19-related AKI and CKD development. The development of COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), in particular, may be mediated through IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suggesting a direct connection between the COVID-19-related immune response and the development of chronic disease. Chronic manifestations of COVID-19 also include systemic conditions like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which may reflect a spectrum of clinical presentations of persistent immune dysregulation. The lessons learned and those undergoing continued study likely have broad implications for understanding viral infections’ immunologic and inflammatory consequences beyond coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that is one of the most significant challenges to public health over the past few years. Most people are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but older adults are more vulnerable. Aging is one of the major risk factors for the detrimental consequences of COVID-19, likely due to chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, both of which are the characteristics of old age. Immunosenescence refers to the weakening of the immune system with age while inflammaging describes the low-grade chronic inflammation seen in older individuals. One key aspect of human aging is immune deficiency. During aging, our body's defense system weakens, resulting in decreased responses to infection by novel pathogens and a reduced ability to become immunized. The presence of chronic inflammation and viral infection in old age may cause several adverse unpredictable outcomes increasing the propensity and severity of the disease and requires to be considered, enabling people to better prepare for the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. This requires consideration so that individuals can better be prepared to address the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. In this review, we discuss the clinical characteristics of elderly COVID-19 patients and survey the associated molecular pathways that are pivotal for the interactions of the coronavirus and host cellular responses, including immunosenescence, inflammation, telomere attrition, impaired autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in major aging signaling pathways, which are crucial for the discovery of new therapeutic and preventive methods in the ongoing pandemic.">

The mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. We analyzed blood samples from infants (median age 2.3 months) with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 30), RSV (n = 19), and healthy controls (n = 17) using single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, and cytokine profiling. Both viruses triggered comparable interferon responses across PBMC subsets but differed in NK cell and inflammatory responses. Severe RSV cases showed reduced NK cell frequencies, lower IFNG expression, and decreased chromatin accessibility at T-BET and EOMES binding sites. RSV infections were also associated with increased CD4 + T EMRA , memory T reg and transitional B cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was characterized by stronger pro-inflammatory signatures, including increased NFKB pathway activity and higher serum TNF concentrations. These findings highlight distinct immune responses to RSV and SARS-CoV-2, providing insights that may inform clinical decisions.">

In SOTRs, the vaccine-induced adaptive immune response is significantly attenuated compared to the response in healthy individuals.

        <tr id="Abstract COVID‐19 commonly leads to respiratory issues, yet numerous patients also exhibit a diverse range of neurological conditions, suggesting a detrimental impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 or the viral Spike protein on the central nervous system. Nonetheless, the molecular pathway behind neurological pathology and the presumed neurotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains largely unexplored. We generated human cortical organoids (HCOs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to assess: (1) the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 main entry factors; (2) their vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; and (3) the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to the Spike protein on their transcriptome. Results proved that (1) HCOs express the main SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors and co‐receptors; (2) HCOs may be productively infected by SARS‐CoV‐2; (3) the viral particles released by SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected HCOs are able to re‐infect another cellular line; and (4) the infection resulted in the activation of apoptotic and stress pathways, along with inflammatory processes. Notably, these effects were recapitulated when HCOs were exposed to the Spike protein alone. The data obtained demonstrate that SARS‐CoV‐2 likely infects HCOs probably through the binding of ACE2, CD147, and NRP1 entry factors. Furthermore, exposure to the Spike protein alone proved sufficient to disrupt their homeostasis and induce neurotoxic effects, potentially contributing to the onset of long‐COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="Current understanding of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and host responses driving the pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate gene expression patterns during acute SARS-CoV-2 illness. Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples. We also generated expression data on the human nose organoid model during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The human nose organoid-generated host transcriptional response captured many aspects of responses observed in the above patient samples, while suggesting the existence of distinct host responses to SARS-CoV-2 depending on the cellular context, involving both epithelial and cellular immune responses. Our findings provide a catalog of SARS-CoV-2 host response genes changing over time and magnitude of these host responses were significantly correlated to viral load.">

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to have neurotropism and therefore to lead to not only peripheral inflammatory responses but also neuroinflammation. Because the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), can be found in many intraocular tissues, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also contribute to persistent intraocular neuroinflammation, microcirculation dysfunction and ocular symptoms. Increased awareness of neuroinflammation and future research on interventional strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are important for improving long-term outcomes, reducing disease burden, and improving quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this review is to focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and intraocular neuroinflammation and to discuss current evidence and future perspectives, especially possible connections between conditions and potential treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Type I interferons exert their antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including but not limited to LY6E, CH25H, IFITM2/3, and IFIH1. However, the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of action of most ISGs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet fully understood. By screening 109 ISG-knockout cell lines, we identify that phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an interferon-inducible protein, acts as a crucial restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells lacking PLSCR1 are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, overexpression of PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depletion of PLSCR1 enhances cellular entry of both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by specifically downregulating plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the virus's receptor, without affecting the overall levels of ACE2 within the cell. As such, we unraveled previously unappreciated mechanisms by which PLSCR1 exerts its restrictive effect on SARS-CoV-2. These data provide new insights into the interplay between host innate antiviral immunity and SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on novel antiviral therapeutics.


IMPORTANCE
Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been identified as a critical host restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we demonstrated that PLSCR1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry by downregulating the plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for viral entry. Our findings elucidate a novel host-pathogen interaction that not only deepens our understanding of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 but offers potential strategies for therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Few pathogens have historically been subjected to as intense scientific and clinical scrutiny as SARS-CoV-2. The genetic, immunological, and environmental factors influencing disease severity and post-infection clinical outcomes, known as correlates of immunity, remain largely undefined. Clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to those with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms. While most infected individuals return to their former health and fitness within a few weeks, some develop debilitating chronic symptoms, referred to as long-COVID. Autoimmune responses have been proposed as one of the factors influencing long-COVID and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between viral infections and autoimmune pathologies is not new. Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, among others, have been shown to induce the production of autoantibodies and the onset of autoimmune conditions. Given the extensive literature on SARS-CoV-2, here we review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmune pathologies, with a focus on autoantibodies. We closely examine mechanisms driving autoantibody production, particularly their connection with disease severity and long-COVID.">

        <tr id="Objective Vaccination is protective against severe COVID-19 disease, yet whether vaccination reduces COVID-19-associated inflammation in pregnancy has not been established. The objective of this study is to characterize maternal and cord cytokine profiles of acute SARS-CoV-2 “breakthrough” infection (BTI) after vaccination, compared with unvaccinated infection and uninfected controls. Study design 66 pregnant individuals enrolled in the MGH COVID-19 biorepository (March 2020-April 2022) were included. Maternal sera were collected from 26 unvaccinated and 21 vaccinated individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cord sera were collected at delivery. Maternal and cord sera from 19 term dyads without current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed as controls. Cytokines were quantified using the Human Inflammation 20-Plex ProcartaPlex assay. Results There was a significantly higher incidence of severe/critical maternal illness in unvaccinated pregnant individuals with SARS-CoV-2 compared to vaccinated (10/26 (38%) vs. 0/21 (0%), p<0.01). Significantly higher maternal levels of TNFα and CD62P were observed in vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 BTI compared with unvaccinated individuals with infection (p<0.05). Network correlation analyses revealed a distinct maternal cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals. Neither unvaccinated nor vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in elevated cord cytokines compared to controls. Multivariate analyses demonstrate distinct maternal and cord cytokine profiles in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 at delivery. Conclusion Vaccination was associated with higher maternal cytokine levels during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to unvaccinated infection, which may reflect vaccine-mediated priming of the immune system. A fetal inflammatory response specific to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a deadly human viral disease with a high rate of infection, morbidity, and mortality. Although vaccines and antiviral treatments are available, hospitalizations remain steady, and concerns about long-term consequences persist. Therefore, there is a great urgency to develop novel therapies. Here, we analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication while building an antiviral cellular defense. Our study reveals that miR-155 expression is elevated in patients with COVID-19. Using a mouse model transgenic for human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2, we evaluated the potential of anti-miR-155 therapy. Treating SARS-CoV-2-infected mice with anti-miR-155 significantly reduced miR-155 expression, improved survival, and slightly increased body weight. Notably, these mice showed altered expression of cytokines in the lungs. These findings suggest anti-miR-155 could be a promising therapy to mitigate the cytokine storm and long-lasting symptoms induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, improving public health outcomes and enhancing global pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to over 670 million infections and nearly 7 million deaths worldwide. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has precipitated a significant public health crisis. The prevalence of liver function abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 53% among healthy individuals or patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and shows a positive correlation with disease severity; moreover, specific adaptive immune responses can influence the trajectory and outcomes of COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 may impact autoimmunity through mechanisms such as excessive stimulation of immune responses and molecular mimicry, particularly in genetically predisposed individuals. Currently, the overall mutational trend of SARS-CoV-2 indicates heightened infectivity and immune evasion capabilities. Consequently, vaccination remains crucial for universal protection against this disease. Nevertheless, alongside the widespread implementation of vaccination programs globally, an increasing number of cases have been documented where COVID-19 vaccination appears to trigger new-onset autoimmune hepatitis; yet definitive evidence is still pending elucidation regarding causality. In this review, we analyse the clinical-immunological characteristics, risks associated with severe disease progression, and prognosis for AIH patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; discuss the detrimental effects exerted by SARS-CoV-2 on hepatic function; summarise the mechanisms and attributes leading to new-onset AIH; as well as provide insights into how vaccination may interfere with autoimmunity processes. We continue to underscore the significance of vaccination while aiming to enhance awareness concerning potential risks associated with it—this could facilitate better management strategies for autoimmune diseases along with appropriate adjustments in vaccination protocols. Although the precise triggering mechanism linking COVID-19-related events to AIH remains unclear, existing evidence suggests that this relationship is far from coincidental.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an RNA virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the lungs and airways, it can also infect other organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the choroid plexus could serve as a potential entry site for SARS-CoV-2 into the brain. Tissue samples from 24 deceased COVID-19-positive individuals were analyzed. Reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on selected brain regions, including the choroid plexus, to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy were used to detect and localize two characteristic proteins of SARS-CoV-2: the spike protein S1 and the nucleocapsid protein. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the choroid plexus. Immunohistochemical staining revealed viral particles localized in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, with the spike protein S1 detected in the late endosomes. Our findings suggest that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (B-CSF) barrier in the choroid plexus serves as a route of entry for SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS. This study contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying CNS involvement in COVID-19 and highlights the importance of further research to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting this entry pathway.">

While advancement of vaccines and drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 virus has reduced severe illness, reinfection remains a significant concern. This paper explores the impact of COVID-19 reinfection on human immunity and examines possible coping strategies, particularly the advancements in plant-derived adjuvants to enhance vaccine efficacy. The virus's ability to mutate, evade immune responses, and affect immune memory highlights the importance and potential effectiveness of treatments that prolong immunity response. Plant-derived adjuvants Advax and Matrix-M have been shown to improve long term immune responses by stimulating long-lasting antibodies and cytotoxic T-cell activation. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy and safety in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19, along plant-based adjuvants reducing reinfection risks. Future research could further focus on develop precising adjuvants’ formulations, exploring more plant-based compounds that could be apply in vaccine development, and conducting long-term studies to evaluate long-term immune durability and safety of the vaccines.">

        <tr id="The reaction of different cell types to prion infections is highly heterogeneous. While neurons experience spine retraction and eventually death, astrocytes and microglia undergo strong activation and proliferation. Here we analyzed the cell-type specific responses to prion diseases by establishing a spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of mice infected with RML prion strain. Brain areas with severe neuronal loss, such as the thalamus and cerebellum, experienced intense microgliosis. Starting from 30 weeks post-inoculation, we observed the accumulation of a novel microglial subpopulation characterized by strong expression of Gpnmb in these brain regions. The molecular profile of Gpnmb+ microglia reflected a state of enhanced phagocytic activity with upregulation of genes associated with lysosomal function and degradation, including vacuolar ATPase V0 domain subunit d2 (Atp6v0d2) and Galectin-3 (Lgals3). In microglial-like, murine BV2 cells, Gpnmb upregulation was induced by soluble find-me signals released during apoptosis, but not by apoptotic bodies or prion accumulation. Gpnmb ablation in BV2 cells impaired their ability to phagocytose apoptotic cells, underscoring its essential role in maintaining microglial phagocytosis. Our findings define Gpnmb⁺ microglia as a distinct, apoptosis-driven phagocytic state, linking neuronal loss to microglial activation in prion disease. The upregulation of GPNMB in sCJD patients, along with its role in apoptotic clearance and lysosomal function, positions it as both a key regulator of microglial responses and a potential biomarker of disease progression.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus responsible for COVID-19, interacts with the host immune system through complex mechanisms that significantly influence disease outcomes, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity. These interactions are crucial in determining the disease's severity and the host's ability to clear the virus. Given the virus's substantial socioeconomic impact, high morbidity and mortality rates, and public health importance, understanding these mechanisms is essential. This article examines the diverse innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2's structural proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, along with nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open reading frames. These proteins play pivotal roles in immune modulation, facilitating viral replication, evading immune detection, and contributing to severe inflammatory responses such as cytokine storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus employs strategies like suppressing type I interferon production and disrupting key antiviral pathways, including MAVS, OAS-RNase-L, and PKR. This study also explores the immune pathways that govern the activation and suppression of immune responses throughout COVID-19. By analyzing immune sensing receptors and the responses initiated upon recognizing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, this review elucidates the complex pathways associated with the innate immune response in COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights for therapeutic interventions and informs public health strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Several respiratory viruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‐Coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), suppress nuclear factor‐E2‐related factor‐2 (NRF2) antioxidant response, generating oxidative stress conditions to its advantage. NRF2 has also been reported to regulate the innate immune response through the inhibition of the interferon (IFN) pathway. However, its modulation in younger individuals and its correlation with the IFN response remain to be elucidated. Methods The NRF2 and redox‐related genes expression was examined in nasopharyngeal swabs from children attending the pediatric hospital for SARS‐CoV‐2 molecular testing. Expression levels were analyzed by stratifying the population according to the SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity, age, or the presence of symptoms. The results were correlated with Types I and III IFN genes and IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs). Results We found that NRF2 expression was markedly diminished in positive patients compared to negative. Moreover, it correlated with higher expression of IFNα2 and IFNλ3, as well as ISG15 and ISG56. Interestingly, symptomatic patients with anosmia/ageusia showed pronounced expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease1/redox factor 1 (APE1), together with Type I IFNs, ISG56, and the inflammasome component NLRP3. Conclusion The results indicate an interdependence between NRF2 antioxidant pathway and IFN‐mediated response during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in young subjects.">

Here, we showed that neutrophilia can be detected acutely and even months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and mice, while neutrophil depletion reduced disease severity in mice. A key factor in neutrophilia and severe disease in infected mice was traced to the chemokine CXCL12 secreted by bone marrow cells and unexpectedly, endothelial cells. CXCL12 levels were negatively correlated with LDN numbers in longitudinal analyses of patient blood samples. CXCL12 blockade in SARS-CoV-2–infected mice increased blood/lung neutrophil numbers, thereby accelerating disease progression without changing lung virus titers. The exaggerated mortality caused by CXCL12 blockade could be reversed by neutrophil depletion. In addition, blocking interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) reduced CXCL12 levels, suggesting a signal transduction from virus-mediated ACE2 ligation to increased CXCL12 secretion. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of CXCL12 in diminishing neutrophilia, including low-density neutrophilia, and its deleterious effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results also support the involvement of SARS-CoV-2–endothelial cell interactions in viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the respiratory system and other organ systems. Tissue injuries resulting from viral infection and host hyperinflammatory responses may lead to moderate to severe pneumonia, systemic complications, and even death. While anti-inflammatory agents have been used to treat patients with severe COVID-19, their therapeutic effects are limited. GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) is a pro-inflammatory receptor expressed on vascular endothelial cells, regulating leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a GPR4 antagonist, NE-52-QQ57, in the SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Our results demonstrated that GPR4 antagonist treatment increased the survival rate in this severe COVID-19 mouse model. The inflammatory response, characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was reduced in the GPR4 antagonist group compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, both SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and infectious viral titers in the mouse lung were decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive mouse brains was also decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, the GPR4 antagonist inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero E6 cells. Together, these results suggest that GPR4 antagonism may be explored as a novel approach for the treatment of COVID-19 and other similar viral diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has profoundly impacted global health, with pneumonia emerging as a major complication in severe cases. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is marked by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an excessive inflammatory response, resulting in oxidative stress and significant tissue damage, particularly in the respiratory system. Antioxidants have garnered considerable attention for their potential role in managing COVID-19 pneumonia by mitigating oxidative stress and modulating immune responses. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the use of antioxidants in hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Studies exploring antioxidants, including vitamins, trace elements, nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O3), glutathione (GSH), L-carnitine, melatonin, bromelain, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and numerous polyphenols, have yielded promising outcomes. Through their ROS-scavenging properties, these molecules support endothelial function, reduce the thrombosis risk, and may help mitigate the effects of the cytokine storm, a key contributor to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Clinical evidence suggests that antioxidant supplementation may improve patient outcomes by decreasing inflammation, supporting immune cell function, and potentially shortening recovery times. Furthermore, these molecules may mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19 by exerting direct antiviral effects that inhibit the infection process and genomic replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. Moreover, antioxidants may work synergistically with standard antiviral treatments to reduce viral-induced oxidative damage. By integrating findings from the literature with real-world data from our clinical experience, we gain a more profound understanding of the role of antioxidants in managing COVID-19 pneumonia. Further research combining comprehensive literature reviews with real-world data analysis is crucial to validate the efficacy of antioxidants and establish evidence-based guidelines for their use in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2s) have recently been shown to exert key regulatory functions in innate and adaptive immune response networks that drive the establishment and progression of type 2 immunity and its associated pathologies. Although mainly tissue resident, ILC2s and their crosstalk within tissue microenvironments influences both local and systemic metabolism. In turn, the metabolic status shapes the diverse ILC2 phenotypes and effector functions. Hence, deciphering the metabolic networks of ILC2s is essential in understanding ILC2’s roles in health as well as pathophysiologies. Here we detail a framework of experimental approaches to study key immunometabolic states of primary murine ILC2s and link them to phenotypes and functionality. Utilizing flow cytometry, Single Cell ENergetIc metabolism by ProfilIng Translation inhibition (SCENITH) as well as the Seahorse platform we provide a framework that allows in-depth analysis of cellular bioenergetic states to determine the immunometabolic wiring of ILC2. Linking immunometabolic states and networks to ILC2 phenotypes and effector functions will allow in-depth studies that assess the potential of novel pharmaceutics to alter ILC2 functionality in experimental and clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Coronaviruses are endemic in the human population and include both seasonal viruses as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), with exposure history differing between children and adults. We sought to identify age-specific differences in memory CD4 T cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), as quantitative and qualitative differences in immune function may be responsible for age-related variation in disease presentation. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from cohorts of children and adults enrolled pre-2019 and following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Subjects enrolled post-pandemic had a history of COVID-19 vaccination. Cells were stimulated with peptide pools representing the unique and more cross-reactive portions of the S protein for 24 hours, with cytokine release blocked for the last 4 hours of coculture. Subsets of S-specific CD4 T cells were identified using a 31-plex spectral flow cytometry panel. Results Pre-pandemic, adults had a higher frequency of activated IFNγ+ CD4 T cells specific for the S protein compared to children, with boosting of responses in both adults and children following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, the CD4 T cell response to the S protein was Th1 biased, with adults having a greater proportion of cells expressing IFNγ, IL2 and TNFα. When cytokine-expressing, antigen-specific CD4 T cells were subsetted by CD45RA and CCR7 expression, there was a more naïve phenotype pre-pandemic, with transition to an effector memory phenotype post-2019. Conclusion A greater magnitude of CD4 T cells specific for the S protein was detected in adults pre-pandemic, with this reactivity boosted in both children and adults following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Boosting of reactivity to both unique and conserved S protein epitopes in children and adults suggested that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via vaccination did not preferentially boost memory CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes. Post-pandemic, there was a shift to a more Th1 phenotype together with a gain in cytokine-producing CD4 T cells with a phenotype consistent with effector memory. Disclosures Jennifer L.

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Dendritic cells (DCs) in severe cases exhibited reduced proportions and attenuated expression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86), alongside increased cytochrome c expression, indicating impaired antigen presentation and enhanced apoptosis. NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and -2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) that have caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, a better understanding of host responses to β-CoVs would provide insights into the pathogenesis of these viruses to identify potential targets for medical countermeasures. In this study, our objective is to use a systems biology approach to explore the magnitude and scope of innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection over time in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3/2B4 cells). Total RNA extracted at 12, 24, and 48 hours after β-CoVs or mock infection of Calu-3/2B4 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis to select genes whose expressions were significantly modulated post-infection. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 stimulate similar yet distinct innate antiviral signaling pathways in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that many genes related to the viral life cycle, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated at multiple time points. Based on their profound modulation upon infection by SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron BA.1, four ISGs, i.e., bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 11 (CXCL11), and Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1), were identified as potential drug targets against β-CoVs. Our findings suggest that these genes affect both pathogens directly and indirectly through the innate immune response, making them potential targets for host-directed antivirals. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induce differential effects on host innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a significant impact on public health, particularly for individuals with underlying health conditions such as obesity and diabetes. While vaccination efforts have played a crucial role in reducing hospitalizations, it remains unclear whether the effectiveness of these vaccines varies among different population groups. In this study, we investigated the immune responses generated by various SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms in mouse models with obesity and diabetes, focusing on both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Our findings revealed diminished immune responses in diabetic and obese mice compared to healthy counterparts. After vaccination with adjuvanted subunit or mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccines, both humoral and cell-mediated responses were significantly reduced in diabetic mice. Obese mice also exhibited decreased immunogenicity, albeit to a lesser extent. However, it should be noted that mRNA vaccines demonstrated strong neutralizing responses across all metabolic states, while adjuvanted subunit vaccines elicited higher antibody avidity in mice with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity compared to healthy mice. These results suggest that the impaired humoral and cell-mediated responses observed in altered metabolic states may be linked to chronic inflammation associated with obesity and suboptimal glycemic control in diabetes. Understanding the impact of these metabolic disturbances on vaccine immunogenicity is crucial for developing optimized vaccines that can effectively enhance immune responses and provide long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2, even in individuals with obesity and diabetes. By contributing these findings, we support efforts to improve vaccine efficacy in populations affected by metabolic disorders, advancing effective immunization against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immunocompromised patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often have prolonged viral shedding, and some are clinically suspected of reinfection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, data on this issue are limited. This study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 variants in serially collected respiratory samples from immunocompromised patients with prolonged viral shedding for over 12 weeks or relapsed viral shedding after at least 2 weeks of viral clearance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
From February 2022 to September 2023, we prospectively enrolled immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had hematologic malignancies or had undergone transplantation and were admitted to a tertiary hospital. Weekly saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from enrolled patients for at least 12 weeks after diagnosis. Genomic RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on samples, and those testing positive underwent viral culture to isolate the live virus. Spike gene full sequencing via Sanger sequencing and real-time reverse transcription-PCR for detecting mutation genes were conducted to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants.


RESULTS
Among 116 enrolled patients, 20 with prolonged or relapsed viral shedding were screened to identify the variants. Of these 20 patients, 7 (35%) exhibited evidence of re-infection; one of 8 patients with prolonged viral shedding and 6 of 12 with relapsed viral shedding were reinfected with SARS-CoV-2.


CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that approximately one-third of immunocompromised patients with persistent or relapsed viral shedding had reinfection with different variants of SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Compromised male reproductive health, including reduced testosterone and sperm count, is one of the long COVID symptoms in individuals recovering from mild-severe disease. COVID-19 patients display testicular injury in the acute stage and altered serum fertility markers in the recovery phase, however, long-term implications on the testis remain unknown. This study characterized the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on testis function. The K18-hACE2 mice that survived SARS-CoV-2 infection were followed for one month after infection and the testicular injury and function markers were assessed at different stages of infection and recovery. The long-term impact of infection on key testes function-related hormones and male fertility was measured. The efficacy of inflammation-suppressing drug in preventing testicular injury was also evaluated. The morphological defects like sloughing of spermatids into the lumen and increased apoptotic cells sustained for 2–4 weeks after infection and correlated with testicular inflammation and immune cell infiltration. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of inflammatory, cell death, and steroidogenic pathways. Furthermore, reduced testosterone levels associated with a transient reduction in sperm count and male fertility. Most testicular impairments resolved within one month of infection. Importantly, dexamethasone treatment attenuated testicular damage, inflammation, and immune infiltration. Our results implicate virus-induced cytokine storm as the major driver of testicular injury and functional impairments, timely prevention of which limits testis damage. These findings serve as a model for evaluating therapeutics in long COVID patients and may guide clinical strategies to improve male reproductive health outcomes post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Studies have proposed a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and islet dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated how SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein affects human islet microvascular function. Using confocal microscopy and living pancreas slices from non-diabetic organ donors, we show that a SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 recombinant protein activates pericytes - key regulators of islet capillary diameter and beta cell function-and induces capillary constriction. These effects are driven by a loss of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from pericytes' plasma membrane, impairing ACE2 activity and increasing local angiotensin II levels. Our findings highlight islet pericyte dysfunction as a potential contributor to the diabetogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and offer new insights into the mechanisms linking COVID-19, vascular dysfunction and diabetes.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with neurological effects that persist beyond the acute phase, collectively referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or “long COVID.” This article discusses the neurological impacts of PASC, which can occur regardless of the initial illness’s severity. Studies indicate that most patients continue to experience symptoms for at least 3 months post-infection. Long-term effects include neurocognitive deficits, sleep disturbances, and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. Proposed mechanisms underlying these effects include neuroinflammation, microvascular damage, and autoimmune responses, while direct viral neuroinvasion remains a topic of ongoing debate. SARS-CoV-2 may also worsen pre-existing neurological disorders and increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease. The article highlights the need for longitudinal studies to better understand the variability in outcomes and the mechanisms driving these persistent effects. In addition, it explores the inflammatory pathways linking long COVID to AD. Both conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation, activation of shared markers such as the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome, and alterations in amyloid-beta production. The apolipoprotein E4 gene, a known risk factor for AD, is also associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. Neuroimaging studies reveal brain changes in COVID-19 survivors, particularly in regions related to cognition and memory, further emphasizing the need for long-term research to assess the potential role of long COVID in exacerbating neurodegenerative diseases.">

 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. However, SARS-CoV-2 chiefly infects lungs through the binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) expressed on the alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, the intestinal epithelial cells also express ACE2 receptors. Not only has the SARS-CoV-2 been detected in nasopharyngeal and mid-nasal samples, but also it seems SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found in the feces of infectious patients. In fact, fecal samples of patients contain RNA of the virus. The intensity of COVID-19 has mainly been associated with aging and comorbidities. Older patients experience a decline in the alteration of the gut microbiome, and COVID-19 has proven to be most fatal in this age group, further emphasizing the potential critical role of gut microbiota in this disease. The lung was formerly believed to be a sterile area free from bacteria. However, the lung microbiome has received more attention due to its recent link to several respiratory illnesses and immunity. In this review article, data from COVID-19 research and gut–lung cross-talk in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease and explored the bidirectional impacts of it on the gut–lung axis microbiome were discussed.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are significant 21st-century pandemics with distinct virological and clinical characteristics. COVID-19 primarily presents as an acute respiratory illness, while HIV leads to chronic immune suppression. Understanding their differences can enhance public health strategies and treatment approaches. Purpose This narrative review compares the virology, transmission, immune responses, and clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV to inform treatment strategies and public health interventions. Methods A narrative review was conducted, synthesizing data from peer-reviewed literature and expert commentary from 2010 to 2024. Databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant studies. Results SARS-CoV-2 primarily spreads through airborne droplets and contaminated surfaces, while HIV transmits through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves both innate and adaptive systems, potentially leading to a cytokine storm in severe cases. In contrast, HIV evades the immune system by integrating into host cells, resulting in chronic infection and progressive immune deterioration. Treatment for SARS-CoV-2 focuses on symptom management and prevention, with antiviral medications and vaccines playing crucial roles. Conversely, HIV treatment relies on antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress viral replication and maintain immune function. Conclusion The review highlights the acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 versus the chronic progression of HIV. Tailored prevention and treatment strategies are essential for effective disease management. Recommendations Public health strategies should address the unique transmission routes and progression of both viruses. Further research into vaccine development and therapeutic interventions is critical for improving disease management.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection in the placenta can lead to fetal distress and demise, characterized by severe trophoblast necrosis, chronic histiocytic intervillositis (CHI), and massive perivillous fibrin deposition. We aimed to uncover spatial immune‐related protein changes in SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis compared with CHI placentas and uncomplicated pregnancies to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Placentas were retrospectively collected from cases with SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis resulting in fetal distress/demise (n = 9), CHI (n = 9), and uncomplicated term controls (n = 9). The expression of 53 immune‐related proteins was quantified using GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler in three separate compartments: villi (fetal compartment), intervillous space, and decidua (both maternal compartments). Compared with controls, SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis and CHI both displayed differentially expressed proteins in the intervillous space only, including upregulation of myeloid markers (e.g., CD40, CD11c, CD68, CD163). Specifically, SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis was associated with reduced expression of multiple apoptotic proteins (e.g., BAD, BIM, BLXL, BCL6). In conclusion, SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis and CHI are associated with enhanced myeloid cell infiltration into the intervillous space, but not in the decidua and villi. The more prominently reduced apoptosis‐related protein expression in SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis may lead to an exaggerated immune response, causing acute placental dysfunction and fetal demise.">

        <tr id="Although emerging data have revealed the critical role of memory CD8+ T cells in preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and its memory and innate-like subsets in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with various disease manifestations in an HLA-restricted fashion remain to be understood. Here, we show the strong association of protective cellular immunity with mild COVID-19 and unique cell types against SARS-CoV-2 virus in an HLA-A2 restricted manner. ELISpot assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in mild COVID-19 patients are significantly higher than in severe patients, whereas neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 virus significantly correlate with disease severity. Single-cell analyses of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells, which recognize highly conserved immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes, demonstrate divergent profiles in unvaccinated patients with mild versus severe disease. CD8+ T-cell types including cytotoxic KLRB1+ CD8αα cells with innate-like T-cell signatures, IFNGhiID3hi memory cells and IL7R+ proliferative stem cell-like memory cells are preferentially observed in mild COVID-19, whereas distinct terminally-differentiated T-cell subsets are predominantly detected in severe COVID-19: highly activated FASLhi T-cell subsets and early-terminated or dysfunctional IL4R+ GATA3+ stem cell-like memory T-cell subset. In conclusion, our findings suggest that unique and contrasting SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell profiles may dictate COVID-19 severity. Graphical abstract.

        <tr id="Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus persists in multiple organs due to its tropism for various tissues, including the skeletal system. This study investigates the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including both ancestral and Omicron viral strains, on differentiating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the precursor cells, into osteoblasts. Although both viral strains can productively infect osteoblasts, precursor cell infection remained abortive. Viral exposure during osteoblast differentiation demonstrates that both variants inhibit mineral and organic matrix deposition. This is accompanied by reduced expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the upregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) strongly suggests that the ancestral and Omicron variants may disrupt bone homeostasis by promoting osteoclast differentiation, ultimately leading to the formation of bone-resorbing cells. This process is dependent of spike glycoprotein since its neutralization significantly reduced the effect of infective SARS-CoV-2 and UV-C inactivated virus. This study underscores the capacity of ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants to disrupt osteoblast differentiation, a process essential for preserving the homeostasis and functionality of bone tissue.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has challenged the scientific and medical community since its emergence. Understanding the immunopathogenic events that occur during infection is crucial to developing effective treatment and prevention strategies.Objective: To synthesize the immunological aspects in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019.Development: SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the entry of the virus into host cells through the ACE2 receptor. Once inside, the virus induces an immune response. In the early stages, the innate immune response is activated, which includes the release of interferons and cytokines. However, in some patients, this response becomes deregulated, triggering a cytokine storm that contributes to systemic inflammation and lung damage. T and B cells also play a crucial role; although the activation of CD8+ T cells can help control the infection, their depletion in severe cases has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Immunopathogenic events in COVID-19 are complex and can lead to diverse clinical outcomes. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for the development of targeted therapies and effective vaccines. Continued research is critical to improving our response to future pandemics.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The global pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 has resulted in millions of people experiencing long COVID condition, a range of persistent symptoms following the acute phase, with an estimated prevalence of 27%–64%. Materials and Methods To understand its pathophysiology, we conducted a longitudinal study on viral load and cytokine dynamics in individuals with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We used reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR to quantify viral RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and employed multiplex technology to measure plasma cytokine levels in a cohort of people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Our study included individuals with long COVID condition and those without, all of whom had at least three nasopharyngeal and plasma samples collected within 55 days after diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results Individuals affected with long COVID symptoms had delayed viral clearance and lower viral loads at diagnosis compared to those without symptoms. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed variations in IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10 levels, with delayed normalization in individuals affected by long COVID syndrome. Correlation analysis indicated associations between viral load and IP‐10 and interrelations among cytokines IL‐1β, IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10. Conclusion Our study provides insights into the association between nasopharyngeal viral load, cytokine dynamics, and the development of long COVID syndrome, providing an early signature of this condition.">

        <tr id="The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor antibodies as a therapeutic agent to combat severe COVID-19. Given the constant evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants, the study aims to assess the potential of these inhibitors in adapting to new challenges and improving treatment outcomes. A comprehensive review of relevant literature was conducted using electronic databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The study analyzed the role of IL-6 inhibitors in combating SARS-CoV-2, focusing on their therapeutic potential in treating severe COVID-19 cases, particularly in controlling the overshooting immune response associated with cytokine storms. IL-6 inhibitors proved to be versatile and effective in attenuating severe immune responses, especially cytokine storms, which are common in advanced COVID-19 cases. The literature emphasizes their ability to regulate the immune system, reduce disease severity, and improve patient outcomes. Their efficacy in controlling the immune response and reducing disease severity makes IL-6 inhibitor antibodies a promising therapeutic strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants.

        <tr id="Introduction The innate immune response is an important first checkpoint in the evolution of an infection. Although adaptive immunity is generally considered the immune component that retains antigenic memory, innate immune responses can also be affected by previous stimulations. This study evaluated the impact of vaccination on innate cell activation by TLR7/8 agonist R848, as well as seasonal variations. Methods To this end, blood samples from a cohort of 304 food and retail workers from the Quebec City region were collected during three visits at 12-week intervals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils were isolated during the first and third visits and were stimulated with R848 to assess the innate immune response. Results Our results show that IL-8 production after stimulation decreased after vaccination. In addition, the IL-8 response was significantly different depending on the season when the visit occurred, for both COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Discussion This study highlights that innate immune responses can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and fluctuate seasonally.">

        <tr id="Context: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China. From the outset, this highly contagious and dangerous illness posed significant risks and challenges for global healthcare systems and populations. Scientists and healthcare professionals worldwide have been striving to develop effective treatments for severe acute respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection, employing both pre-existing and innovative approaches. However, a specific drug targeted explicitly against COVID-19 remains elusive. Despite the reduced prevalence of severe cases and the predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, COVID-19 continues to pose significant risks, particularly for polymorbid patient groups. This review focuses on the potential antiviral effects of promising new drugs, including ensitrelvir, clazakizumab, upamostat, and others. Evidence Acquisition: An analytical review was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases for publications related to promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2, their mechanisms of action, and potential therapeutic effects up to November 2024. Selection criteria included: (1) Free-text availability; (2) English language; (3) relevance to the publication's theme a total of 104 articles were initially selected. Of these, 27 articles were excluded for not meeting the free-text criterion, 14 were excluded due to language incompatibility, and 28 were excluded for thematic irrelevance. Ultimately, data from 35 articles were analyzed and summarized for this review. Results: Thirty-five scientific studies were reviewed to describe current paradigms and emerging concepts in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. Current drugs with proven efficacy include: (1) Combined monoclonal antibodies targeting the S-protein (casirivimab/imdevimab); (2) monoclonal antibody preparations against the S-protein (pemivibart; vilobelimab); (3) viral replication inhibitors (molnupiravir); (4) protease inhibitors (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir); (5) immunosuppressants (dexamethasone; tocilizumab). The review also highlights drugs under development targeting traditional pathways [e.g., viral protease, interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and those aimed at novel mechanisms (e.g., antigalectin-3; adhesion blockers). Conclusions: Although numerous drug effects and potential drug combinations for COVID-19 have been described, limited clinical trials and research focus on identifying novel treatment approaches. Comprehensive investigations are needed to assess and evaluate the risks of different treatment strategies, minimizing potential short- and long-term complications for patients. Such advancements will pave the way for more optimal and effective medical treatment of COVID-19.">

The regeneration of myelin, or remyelination, occurs spontaneously following demyelination. The lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced focal demyelination model enables investigations into the mechanisms of remyelination, providing insight into the molecular basis underlying an evolving remyelinating microenvironment over a tractable time course. Here, we present a detailed analysis using high-resolution single nucleus RNA sequencing to investigate gene expression dynamics across multiple cell populations involved in the remyelination process. We examine three specific time points following focal demyelinating injury in mice, and by delineating activation states within the heterogeneous cell populations of demyelinated lesions, we highlight changes in gene expression within subclusters of each cell population from the early stages of injury response to the initiation and maintenance of remyelination. Our findings reveal how shifts in microglial, astrocytic and fibroblast activities within lesions are associated with efficient oligodendrocyte differentiation during remyelination.">

Cellular senescence has been implicated as a key pathogenic mechanism. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of regorafenib, a previously characterized senomorphic drug, for severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected K18-hACE2 mice, overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor, exhibited 100% mortality by 10 days post infection. Regorafenib treatment significantly improved survival rates, approximately 43% remaining alive. Mechanistically, regorafenib effectively suppressed type I and II interferon and cytokine signaling. Notably, regorafenib inhibited NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, a key driver of the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of regorafenib and suggest its potential use as a promising treatment option for severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="In the past decade, a major goal in biomedical research has been to understand why individuals differ in disease susceptibility, disease dynamics, and progression. In many pathologies, this variability stems from evolved immune mechanisms that resist inflammatory stress from various diseases that have been encountered throughout life. These may provide advantages against other diseases, reduce comorbidities, and enhance longevity. This study evaluates prior immunity as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, crucial for understanding plasmatic signaling cascades in different disease stages and their impact on disease progression. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, primarily affects the respiratory system and presents a wide range of symptoms, posing significant challenges to medicine. This study systematically analyzed prior immunity and inflammation in two independent cohorts of infected patients. A serological profile is determined by protein microarrays, which identify IgM and IgG responses against 37 prevalent microbial pathogens and provide a comprehensive plasma analysis of 21 acute-phase proteins. Our results reveal distinct serological profiles correlating with disease severity, indicating that immune system dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is linked to existing immunity. These findings highlight the relevance of prior immunity for monitoring disease progression, particularly in infections and vaccine failure, and underscore the importance of functional proteomics in determining prognostic biomarkers.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells are associated with viral clearance and improved outcomes in COVID-19, but also with immunopathology. Defining T cell diversity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables implementation of T cells in prevention and treatment strategies. T cells recognize peptide sequences from pathogens upon presentation in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Human MHC molecule diversity results in a wide array of peptide recognition by T cells making viral escape difficult, but also challenging to measure. Methods Using the ImmunoSEQ Assay to sequence complementarity-determining regions in the β chains (CDR3β) of the T cell receptor (TCR) from peripheral blood collected from participants in the EPICC COVID-19 cohort study, we quantified and characterized patterns of TCR usage. Multiple bioinformatic pipelines were compared for analysis. Results Our study evaluated TCR repertoires from 39 participants who had mild (20 outpatient) versus severe (19 hospitalized) acute COVID-19, and either experienced unvaccinated primary infection (n = 15) or vaccine breakthrough infection (n = 24) (Table 1). From these four clinical groups, we used the ImmuneCODE database, VDJdatabase and healthy controls to identify CD8 TCR sequences and amino acid motifs in the CDR3β region specific for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We were surprised to find that vaccine breakthrough and primary infection participants exhibited similar frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR sequences over 14-21 days post-symptom onset. Increased use of common TCR clones occurred in participants with older age and comorbidities, which correlated with more severe disease (Figure 1). Strikingly, an increased frequency of non-SARS-CoV-2 TCRs was significantly associated with severe disease in unvaccinated (p = 0.006) and vaccinated participants (p = 0.045). Conclusion In conclusion, our study highlights the opportunities and challenges of studying the complexity of T cell diversity and the utility of combining databases and bioinformatics for identification of patterns of TCR recognition. Interestingly, participants who were hospitalized were more likely to have circulating T cells non-specific for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that vaccines that increase T cell specificity may reduce disease severity.

        <tr id="Alcohol-induced dysregulation of microglial activity is associated with neuroinflammation, cognitive decline, heightened risk for neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol dependence, and escalation of alcohol drinking. Given the challenge of longitudinally sampling primary microglia, we optimized an in vitro method to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-human primates (NHP) into microglia-like cells (induced-microglia; iMGL). The iMGLs displayed transcriptional profiles distinct from those of monocyte progenitors and closely resembling those of primary microglia. Notably, morphological features showed that differentiated iMGLs derived from NHPs with chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) possessed a more mature-like microglial morphology. Additionally, dysregulation in key inflammatory and regulatory markers alongside increased baseline phagocytic activity was observed in CAC-derived IMGLs in the resting state. Phenotypic and functional assessments following LPS stimulation indicated the presence of an immune-tolerant phenotype and enrichment of a CD86+ hyper-inflammatory subpopulation in iMGLs derived from ethanol-exposed animals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vitro differentiation of PBMC offers a minimally invasive approach to studying the impact of CAC on microglial function revealing that CAC reshapes both functional and transcriptional profiles of microglia.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2, also called coronavirus causes SARS-CoV-2 or severe acute respir-atory syndrome, a highly transmissible disease that has rapidly spread worldwide, straining healthcare systems and leading to a substantial number of fatalities. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has revealed a gender difference, with males dying at a greater rate and with more severe cases than women. It's worth noting that the male reproductive system might be par-ticularly susceptible to damage during periods of moderate to severe sickness, which has been linked to cases of orchitis and erectile dysfunction. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles have been found in the tissues of the testes and penile of both living patients who have recov-ered from the virus and in post-mortem analyses of males who have died from it. For males who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2, sexual transmission is not a big concern, even though moderate to severe infections may have detrimental effects on male reproductive health. This includes the depletion of germ cells and Leydig cells that leads to a decrease in the formation of sperm, potentially decreasing the release of male sex hormones. These ad-verse effects may result in issues such as infertility and sexual dysfunction, which are of growing concern for couples looking to conceive or those in need of assisted reproduction. Numerous investigations have examined SARS-CoV-2's effects on male reproductive health from a variety of perspectives. The purpose of this review is to give a general summary of how SARS-CoV-2 has affected male reproductive health.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Problem Although it is still uncertain whether Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) placental infection and vertical transmission occur, inflammation during early pregnancy can have devastating consequences for gestation itself and the growing fetus. If and how SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific immune cells negatively affect placenta functionality is still unknown. Method of study We stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from women of reproductive age with SARS‐CoV‐2 peptides and cocultured them with trophoblast spheroids (HTR‐8/SVneo and JEG‐3) to dissect if SARS‐CoV‐2‐activated immune cells can interfere with trophoblast functionality. The activation and cytokine profile of the PBMCs were determined using multicolor flow cytometry. The functionality of trophoblast spheroids was assessed using microscopy, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and RT‐qPCR. Results SARS‐CoV‐2 S and M peptides significantly activated PBMCs (monocytes, NK cells, and T cells with memory subsets) and induced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFNγ. The activated PBMCs did not impact the viability, growth rate, and invasion capabilities of trophoblast spheroids. Furthermore, the hormonal production of hCG by JEG‐3 spheroids was not compromised upon coculture with the activated PBMCs. mRNA transcript levels of genes involved in trophoblast spheroid functional pathways were also not dysregulated after coculture. Conclusions Together, the findings of our in vitro coculture model, although not fully representative of in vivo conditions, strongly support the claim that the interaction of SARS‐CoV‐2‐activated peripheral blood immune cells with trophoblast cells at the fetal–maternal interface does not negatively affect trophoblast functionality. This goes in hand with the recommendation of vaccinating pregnant women in their first trimester.">

        <tr id="As of early October 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, resulted in approximately 35 million cases and one million fatalities worldwide. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease marked by the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies and a lack of tolerance to nuclear self-antigens. Hypocomple-mentemia, or an abnormal blood complement deficit, is a reliable predictor of infection in SLE patients. Moreover, it has been found that immunoglobulin (Ig), particularly IgG and IgM, is lowered in SLE patients, which may be a factor in their heightened susceptibility to infection. Bloodstream autoantibodies, lymphopenia, aberrant T cells, proinflammatory cytokines, and impaired regulatory systems all lead to an immune response that is aberrant in lupus patients. SLE patients exhibit impaired CD8 T cell responses, including abnormal phagocytosis and chemotaxis. Recent study has shown that COVID-19 infections significantly boost type I inter-feron responses. Patients with SLE and Covid-19 infection typically get immune-suppressing drugs viz corticosteroids, Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK), and tocilizumab, which improve their immune systems and diminution susceptible to Covid-19 infections.">

Studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA can persist after acute infection in serum or tissues, but their role in PCS is unclear. Methods: Here, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analyzed in the serum of 121 PCS patients with predominant fatigue and exertional intolerance, of whom 72 met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, 37 post-COVID recovered healthy controls, and 32 pre-pandemic healthy controls. Results: Spike protein was detected in the serum of 11% of recovered controls, 2% of PCS patients, and 14% of ME/CFS patients between 4 and 31 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not in pre-pandemic samples. The occurrence and concentration of spike protein did not correlate with infection or vaccination timepoints. In ME/CFS patients, spike protein presence was not associated with the severity of symptoms or functional disability. In 5 out of 22 patients who under-went immunoglobulin depletion, spike protein levels were reduced or undetectable after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins. Conclusions: In summary, this study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients but found no association with ME/CFS.">

        <tr id="This review article discusses the role of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infection, both conditions being renowned for their impact on the vascular endothelium. The processes involved in vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis are reviewed briefly before exploring the interplay between hypoxia, VEGF-A, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and inflammatory pathways. We then focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and show how the binding of the viral pathogen to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, as well as to NRP-1, leads to elevated levels of VEGF-A and consequences such as coagulation, vascular dysfunction, and inflammation. HIV infection augments angiogenesis via several mechanisms, most prominently, by the trans-activator of transcription (tat) protein mimicking VEGF-A by binding to its receptor, VEGFR-2, as well as upregulation of NRP-1, which enhances the interaction between VEGF-A and VEGFR-2. We propose that the elevated levels of VEGF-A observed during HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection originate predominantly from activated immune cells due to the upregulation of HIF-1α by damaged endothelial cells. In this context, a few clinical trials have described a diminished requirement for oxygen therapy during anti-VEGF treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The currently available anti-VEGF therapy strategies target the binding of VEGF-A to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. The blocking of both receptors could, however, lead to a negative outcome, inhibiting not only pathological, but also physiological angiogenesis. Based on the examination of published studies, this review suggests that treatment targeting selective inhibition of VEGFR-1 may be beneficial in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 and post-COVID (long COVID) are associated with thromboembolic complications; however, it is still not clear whether platelets play a leading role in this phenomenon. The platelet hyperreactivity could result from the direct interaction between platelets and viral elements or the response to inflammatory and prothrombotic factors released from blood and vessel cells following infection. The existing literature does not provide clear-cut answers, as the results determining platelet status vary according to methodology. Elevated levels of soluble markers of platelet activation (P selectin, PF4), increased platelet aggregates, and platelet-derived microparticles suggest the activation of platelets circulating in the bloodstream of COVID-19 patients. Similarly, platelets isolated from COVID-19 patients demonstrate increased reactivity in response to collagen, thrombin, and ADP. By contrast, an analysis of whole blood from COVID-19 patients indicates the reduced activation of the fibrinogen receptor. Similarly, some in vitro studies report potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 in platelets, whereas others do not indicate any direct effect of the virus on platelets. The aim of this work is to review and evaluate the reliability of the methodology for testing platelet function after contact with SARS-CoV-2. Despite the diversity of methods yielding varying results and the influence of plasma components or blood cells, it can be concluded that platelets play an important role in the development of thrombotic complications after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a profound global impact since its emergence in late 2019. Characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress and death, COVID-19 has necessitated extensive research into the host-pathogen interactions that drive disease progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies. This study employed a multi-omic approach that combined direct RNA sequencing (DRS) and Illumina cDNA sequencing to investigate whole blood transcriptomic profiles in COVID-19 patients. By leveraging the unique capabilities of Nanopore DRS, which provides long-read sequencing data, we were able to capture not only gene expression levels but also crucial RNA modifications, including poly(A) tail length, non-adenine residue (non-A), pseudouridylation (psU), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation. This comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore the impact of these RNA modifications on gene expression and function within the context of COVID-19. Our findings reveal significant alterations in gene expression patterns, poly(A) tail lengths, non-A and the prevalence of psU and m5C modifications in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. These results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between viral infection, host immune response, and RNA processing, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

Recent studies have revealed an imbalance in the von Willebrand factor (VWF)-ADAMTS13 axis in patients with RTIs, including COVID-19. We examined whether this imbalance contributes to RTI-mediated stroke severity. Wild-type (WT), Vwf -/-, or Adamts13-/- mice with respective littermate controls (Vwf +/+, or Adamts13+/+) were infected intranasally with sublethal doses of S. aureus (on days 0, 2, and 5) or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (on day 0) and subjected to transient (30 or 45 min) cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion. In S. aureus-infected mice, infarct volumes were assessed on day 2 and functional outcomes on weeks 1 and 4 post-reperfusion. In SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, infarct volumes and functional outcomes (Bederson score) were assessed on day 1 post-reperfusion. We demonstrated that S. aureus or SARS-CoV-2 RTI was accompanied by an imbalance in the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis and an increase in plasma levels of IL-6, CXCL1, and MCP-1, which was associated with larger infarcts and worse functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. mock-infection). S. aureus- or SARS-CoV-2-infected Vwf -/- mice exhibited reduced infarcts and improved functional outcomes, while infected Adamts13-/- mice displayed greater stroke severity (P<0.05 vs. control). In the models of RTI preceding stroke, VWF contributes to stroke severity, while ADAMTS13 is protective.">

Methods We performed single-cell transcriptome coupled with T-cell/B-cell receptor (TCR/BCR) sequencing in 15 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from Omicron infection and naïve with booster vaccination. Results We found that after breakthrough infection, multiple cell clusters showed activation of the type I IFN pathway and widespread expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); T and B lymphocytes exhibited antiviral and proinflammatory-related differentiation features with pseudo-time trajectories; and large TCR clonal expansions were concentrated in effector CD8 T cells, and clonal expansions of BCRs showed a preference for IGHV3. In addition, myeloid cells in the BA.5.2 breakthrough infection with the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV were characterized by enhanced proliferation, chemotactic migration, and antigen presentation. Discussion Collectively, our study informs the comprehensive understandings of immune characterization for Omicron breakthrough infection, revealing the positive antiviral potential induced by booster doses of vaccine and the possible "trained immunity" phenomenon in the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV, providing a basis for the selection of vaccination strategies.">

Trajectory analysis indicates bifurcating paths starting from the homeostatic state branching toward stress-response and inflammatory states. Three major functional modules: ribosomal/translation, coordinated immune cell function, and inflammatory/transcriptional regulation, showing disease-specific activation patterns were identified.

        <tr id="Background/Aim Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, manifests a wide range of clinical symptoms ranging from mild to moderate and severe. Host-related factors influence the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection; for instance, the expression of host microRNAs (miRNAs) could influence the progression and complications of COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the expression pattern of endogenous miRNAs in 80 severe COVID-19 patients compared to a group of healthy individuals. Materials and Methods The miRNA screening expression analysis was performed using TaqMan Low-Density Array, and the expression changes of miR-490-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-454-3p, and miR-431-5p were validated using RT-qPCR. In silico analysis was used to identify new targets and predict the pathways, biological processes, and interactions of the selected miRNAs. Results The miR-490-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-454-3p, and miR-431-5p, were over-expressed in the total population of severe COVID-19 patients compared to the control group. miR-490-3p was found to be over-expressed in both female and male COVID-19 patients.

        <tr id="Exacerbated inflammation is a major contributor to tissue damage and mortality in infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. The resolution phase of inflammation is critical for restoring tissue homeostasis following an injury. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is a ubiquitous protein that plays a fundamental role in the resolution of inflammation, including in preclinical models of infectious disease. Here, we investigated the role of AnxA1 in coronavirus infection and its potential as a host-targeted therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2. Wild-type (WT) and AnxA1 knockout (AnxA1KO) mice were intranasally infected with the murine betacoronavirus MHV-3 to study the endogenous role of AnxA1. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses in the lungs of MHV-3-infected mice revealed increased AnxA1 expression and its cleavage, which was associated with neutrophilic infiltration (Ly6G+ cells) mainly in peribronchiolar and perivascular regions. AnxA1-deficient mice exhibited higher neutrophilic infiltration and lung damage, alongside increased CXCL1 production in the lungs, when compared to WT-infected mice. In a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice, we found increased AnxA1 cleavage associated with lung inflammation. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice with the AnxA1-mimetic peptide, Ac2-26, reduced lung damage and lethality, without altering the host ability to deal with viral replication. Notably, Ac2-26-treated mice exhibited similar levels of protection to that afforded by the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings highlight the protective role of the endogenous AnxA1 in mitigating coronavirus-induced lung inflammation and underscore the therapeutic potential of AnxA1 mimetic Ac2-26 as a host-targeted therapy against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the recognition of viral particles and activation of the innate immune system, but their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still poorly characterized. In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 10 (TLR10) in modulating the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results showed that overexpression of TLR10 in A549 lung epithelial cells, immunostimulated with SARS-CoV-2 proteins S and N mainly downregulated proinflammatory cytokines and interferons and affected gene expression in the cocultured THP-1 monocytes. Our results suggest that TLR10 could mediate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection by downregulating the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL10, IL6, IL8, and IFNβ. Modulation of TLR10 expression could have implications for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, in whom excessive inflammation leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a key feature. However, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of modulating TLR10 expression on the antiviral response and the overall balance of the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

CSF derives from and borders central nervous system (CNS) tissue, allowing for comprehensive accounting of cell types along with their relative abundance and immunologic profiles relevant to CNS diseases. Using integration techniques applied to publicly available datasets in combination with our own studies, we generated a compendium with 139 subjects encompassing 135 CSF and 58 blood samples. Healthy subjects and individuals across a wide range of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, COVID-19, and autoimmune encephalitis, were included. We found differences in lymphocyte and myeloid subset frequencies across different diseases as well as in their distribution between blood and CSF. We identified what we believe to be a new subset of AREG+ dendritic cells exclusive to the CSF that was more abundant in subjects with MS compared with healthy controls. Finally, transcriptional cell states in CSF microglia-like cells and lymphoid subsets were elucidated. Altogether, we have created a reference compendium for single-cell transcriptional profiling encompassing CSF immune cells useful to the scientific community for future studies on neurologic diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute COVID-19 infection causes significant alterations in the innate and adaptive immune systems. While most individuals recover naturally, some develop long COVID (LC) syndrome, marked by persistent or new symptoms weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, there are no clinical tests to distinguish LC patients from those fully recovered. Understanding the immunological basis of LC is essential for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches. Methods We performed deep immunophenotyping and functional assays to examine the immunological profiles of LC patients, individuals with active COVID-19, recovered patients, and healthy donors. This analysis assessed both innate and adaptive immune features, identifying potential biomarkers for LC syndrome. A Binomial Generalized Linear Model (BGLM) was used to pinpoint immune features characterizing LC. Results COVID-19 patients exhibited depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes, and monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells. Elevated basal inflammation was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to LC patients, whose immune profiles were closer to those of healthy donors and recovered individuals. However, LC patients displayed persistent immune alterations, including reduced T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Tregs) and switched memory B cells, similar to COVID-19 patients. Through BGLM, a unique adaptive immune signature for LC was identified, featuring memory CD8 and gd T cells with low proliferative capacity and diminished expression of activation and homing receptors. Discussion The findings highlight a unique immunological signature associated with LC syndrome, characterized by persistent adaptive immune dysregulation. While LC patients displayed recovery in innate immune profiles comparable to healthy and Recovered individuals, deficits in T cell and memory B cell populations were evident, differentiating LC from full recovery. These findings provide insights into LC pathogenesis and may support the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Many common symptoms in post-acute sequelae following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) overlap with those of multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined symptoms and performance of the PASC score, developed in the general population, in MS based on infection history.


METHODS
We surveyed North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry participants regarding infections and categorized participants based on infection history. Symptoms experienced before, during, and after infection were used to identify persistent new symptoms. PASC was defined as a score ⩾ 12 based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study RECOVER.


RESULTS
Of 4787 participants surveyed, 2927 were included: 294 (10%) having recent COVID-19; 853 (29.1%) recent non-COVID-19 infection; 246 (8.4%) recent COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infection; 1534 (52.4%) uninfected, defined as never having COVID-19 nor any infection within the past 6 months. Compared to those uninfected, infection groups reported at least a two-fold increase in fever, cough, loss of smell/taste, and shortness of breath. Based on persistent new symptoms, PASC was identified in only 1.5% of participants with COVID-19.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests lower than expected prevalence of PASC in MS and a complex association between infections and development of new persistent symptoms following infections. The similar proportions classified with PASC across infection groups shows that symptoms of PASC are common and complicate assessment of PASC in MS.">

 Background:
 Preceding respiratory tract infections (RTIs) caused by bacteria or viruses are associated with worse stroke outcomes, likely due to an exaggerated inflammatory immune response, endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and coagulopathy. Recent studies have revealed increased plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels and reduced ADAMTS13 activity (the risk factors for stroke) in patients with RTIs, including COVID-19. However, it remains unclear whether an imbalance in the VWF–ADAMTS13 axis plays a causative role in the pathophysiology of
 S. aureus
 - or COVID-19-associated stroke severity or is merely an associative marker of disease status.


 Objective:
 To examine whether an imbalance in the VWF–ADAMTS13 axis is a causal link between RTIs and stroke severity.


 Methods:
 Wild-type (WT) mice (3–4 months old) were infected intranasally with sublethal doses of
 S. aureus
 (on days 0, 2, and 5) or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (on day 0). On day 6 (
 S. aureus
 ) or day 3 (SARS-CoV-2), the infection was confirmed to be localized in the lungs (but not in the brain) and the plasma VWF levels and ADTMTS13 activity were quantified. In another set of experiments, WT,
 Vwf
 −/−
 , and
 Adamts13
 −/−
 mice (3–4 months old) with respective littermate controls were subjected to transient (30 or 45 min) cerebral ischemia (filament stroke model) followed by reperfusion. For the
 S. aureus
 experiments, brain infarcts were assessed on day 2 post-reperfusion and functional outcomes (corner test, wire hanging test, modified neurological severity score, and rotarod test) on week 1 and 4 post-reperfusion. For the SARS-CoV-2 experiments, brain infarcts and functional outcomes (the Bederson score) were assessed on day 1 post-reperfusion.


 Result:
 We demonstrated that
 S. aureus
 or SARS-CoV-2 infection localized to the lungs in the WT mice resulted in increased (2–3 fold) plasma VWF levels and reduced ADAMTS13 activity, concomitant with larger infarcts and worse functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. mock-infected mice) up to day 28 post-reperfusion.
 S. aureus
 - or SARS-CoV-2-infected VWF-deficient mice exhibited reduced infarcts and improved functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. infected

 Vwf
 +/+

 ). In contrast,
 S. aureus
 or SARS-CoV-2-infected ADAMTS13-deficient mice displayed greater stroke severity (P<0.05 vs. infected

 Adamts13
 +/+

 ).


 Conclusion:
 In the experimental models of RTI preceding stroke, VWF plays a causal role in worsening stroke outcomes, while ADAMTS13 is protective.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is central to temporal lobe epilepsy, yet the specific role of myeloid cells remains unclear. In status epilepticus (SE) models, circulating monocytes have been reported to infiltrate the brain, though distinguishing them from microglia remains challenging. Using a rat model, we traced infiltrating monocytes post-SE, to investigate their persistence, phenotypic evolution during epileptogenesis and contribution to neuroinflammation. By tracking phagocyted fluorescent nanoparticles and using CD68 immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that monocytes entered the brain in significant numbers 24 hours post-SE, after the inflammatory peak occurred (7h post-SE). Tracked up to 7 weeks, these cells adopted a microglia-like phenotype, contributed to the microglial scar and sustained low-grade inflammation during the chronic phase of epilepsy solely through their presence, as their expression of pro-inflammatory markers resembled that of non-activated microglia. Importantly, monocytes initially and transiently supported an anti-inflammatory response providing a unique opportunity to modulate neuroinflammation and potentially disrupt epilepsy progression, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with the enveloped RNA betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, led to a global pandemic involving over 7 million deaths. Macrophage inflammatory responses impact COVID-19 severity; however, it is unclear whether macrophages are infected by SARS-CoV-2. We sought to identify mechanisms regulating macrophage expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and to determine if macrophages are susceptible to productive infection. We developed a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mouse whereby hACE2 cDNA was cloned into the mouse ACE2 locus under control of the native promoter. We validated the susceptibility of hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to wild-type mice and an established K18-hACE2 model of acute fulminating disease. Intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 led to pulmonary consolidations with cellular infiltrate, edema, and hemorrhage, consistent with pneumonia, yet unlike the K18-hACE2 model, hACE2 mice survived and maintained stable weight. Infected hACE2 mice also exhibited a unique plasma chemokine, cytokine, and growth factor inflammatory signature relative to K18-hACE2 mice. Infected hACE2 mice demonstrated evidence of viral replication in infiltrating lung macrophages, and infection of macrophages in vitro revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of altered RNA and ribosomal processing machinery as well as activated cellular antiviral defense. Macrophage IL-1β-driven NF-κB transcription of ACE2 was an important mechanism of dynamic ACE2 upregulation, promoting macrophage susceptibility to infection. Experimental models of COVID-19 that make use of native hACE2 expression will allow for mechanistic insight into factors that can either promote host resilience or increase susceptibility to worsening severity of infection.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), alarmed the global community due to the significant loss of human lives during the pandemic. However, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. A positive aspect of this recent pandemic has been that it stimulated scientists to create vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, accelerating the emergence of new therapeutic agents based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Numerous mRNA therapeutic products are currently in development, with dozens at various clinical trial stages. These products have facilitated significant changes in the paradigm of medical therapy, including the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although most of these cardiovascular mRNA therapeutics are still in preclinical development, phase IIa trials for myocardial ischemia therapy have already been completed with encouraging results. The scope of mRNA therapy for CVD is extremely broad, potentially even limitless, with ongoing research including conditions like myocardial ischemia, heart failure, arrhythmias, hypercholesterolemia, and occlusive arterial diseases. Moreover, mRNA can be used to enhance the effectiveness of cell therapies. In the future, researchers predict that mRNA therapies will not only replace some existing biopharmaceuticals and pharmacotherapy methods but also be applied to treat previously considered untreatable cardiovascular diseases.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious threat to people worldwide causing a variety of diseases, manifesting with intestinal, respiratory, hepatic, and neurological symptoms. The therapeutic strategy to counteract SARS-CoV-2 encompasses antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, such as systemic glucocorticoids which may benefit patients with middle and severe COVID-19. The spike glycoprotein (S protein), which recognizes the host cell receptor and initiates the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to it, can be considered a potential target for glucocorticoids. However, the mechanism of glucocorticoid inhibitory action against the S protein is currently unclear due to insufficient study of the ligand-binding sites on the S protein. The aim of the study was to evaluate the binding characteristics of systemic glucocorticoids to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and to elucidate the topological features of non-covalent ligand-protein complexes. AutoDock Vina was used for molecular docking studies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with ligands. Dexamethasone (DEX), methylprednisolone (Medrol), triamcinolone (TAC), and prednisone (PRED) were selected as ligands. The Open Babel 3.1.1 software was used to prepare ligand structures. Two 3D structures of the S protein which have open (RBD-up) and closed (RBD-down) conformations in the receptor-binding domain (PDB ID: 6VYB, and PDB ID: 6VXX), respectively, were used as docking targets (www.rcsb.org). Ligand interactions with amino acid residues were identified using the PLIP web tool (https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de). Visualization of docking results was implemented in PyMol 2.5. Docking study demonstrated that all glucocorticoids can bind to multiple sites in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including the receptor-binding fragment (S1) and the fusion fragment (S2). Methylprednisolone showed the best affinity with the S protein in RBD-up conformation than other glucocorticoids, with a binding free energy of –9.7 kcal/mole and an inhibition constant value of 0.08⋅10–6 M. Triamcinolone demonstrated a high affinity with the S protein in RBD-down conformation, at which the binding free energy was −8.8 kcal/mole and an inhibition constant value was 0.36⋅10–6 M. Our results show that Gly744, Asp745 and Arg1000 are mainly involved in the stabilization of complexes through the hydrogen bonds. Hydrophobic interactions are primarily mediated by Thr572, Ile587, and Val976. These results are an important basis for the development of potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to an emerging health challenge known as long COVID, also known as PASC, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, characterized by symptoms that persist beyond the acute phase of infection. While acute COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique patterns of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives. Research on respiratory virus immunity duration post-vaccination reveals variable outcomes. This study performed a literature review to assess the efficacy and longevity of immune protection post-vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with a focus on immunocompromised populations. Specific objectives included examining humoral and cellular immune responses and exploring the impact of booster doses and hybrid immunity on extending protection. Methods. A literature review was conducted focusing on studies published from January 2014 to November 2024. The search targeted adaptive immunity post-vaccination, natural immunity, and hybrid immunity for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV. Selection criteria emphasized human populations, adaptive immunity outcomes, and immunocompromised individuals. The PICO framework guided the analysis, culminating in a detailed review of 30 studies. Results. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines exhibited robust initial antibody responses, which waned significantly within six months, necessitating frequent boosters. Influenza and RSV vaccines similarly showed declines in immunity, though some influenza vaccines demonstrated moderate durability. Hybrid immunity, arising from combined natural infection and vaccination, provided more resilient and lasting protection than vaccination alone, especially against emerging variants. Immunocompromised individuals consistently exhibited reduced durability in adaptive immune responses across all studied viruses. Challenges include rapid viral mutations, limiting the broad protection of current vaccines. Conclusions. Immune durability varies significantly across virus types and patient populations. Frequent boosters and hybrid immunity are critical to optimizing protection, particularly for vulnerable groups. The findings underscore the need for adaptable vaccination strategies and advancements in vaccine design to counter rapidly mutating respiratory pathogens effectively.">

        <tr id="Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and long-term complications in bone health. Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces bone turnover and promotes bone loss, but the mechanism underlying worsened bone health remains elusive. This study sought to identify specific immune mediators that exacerbated preexisting IMIDs after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Plasma samples from 4 groups were analyzed: healthy, IMID only, COVID-19 only, and COVID-19 + IMID. Using high-throughput multiplexed proteomics, we profiled 1,500 protein biomarkers and identified 148 unique biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with IMIDs, including elevated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17F) and bone resorption markers. Long-term circulating SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, a virulence factor for COVID-19, was detected in the COVID + IMID group. RA was one of the most common IMIDs in our study. ORF8 treatment of RA-derived human osteoblasts (RA-hOBs) increased levels of inflammatory (TNF, IL6, CCL2) and bone resorption (RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio) markers compared with healthy controls. Supernatants from ORF8-treated RA-hOBs drove the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast-like cells. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exposure can exacerbate IMIDs through ORF8-driven inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19–induced bone pathologies.">

        <tr id="Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased severity and mortality from respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination in the general population significantly reduces the risk of severe respiratory viral infection and triggers a strong, polyfunctional and lasting T cell response in healthy individuals. However, vaccine effectiveness in people with diabetes is unclear. Here we studied the magnitude and functional characteristics of vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the full vaccination protocol, and the recall response after a third booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and compared them to those of people without diabetes. We found defects in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory maintenance and the functionality of the vaccine specific T cells in people with diabetes compared to people without. In those individuals with diabetes that harbored detectable vaccine-specific T cells, they displayed an unfocused, tolerogenic phenotype characterized by increased expression of IL-13 and IL-10 in T1D and T2D compared to people without diabetes. These results have implications for vaccination strategies for people with diabetes.">

Recent studies have reported that severe cases of COVID-19 are primarily characterized
by endotheliitis (or endothelialitis), whose severity is related to the pre-existing or current damage to
the complex structure that lines the surface of the vascular endothelium, most notably the glycocalyx.
Such damage results in the loss of many endothelial cell functions. To restore these functions, the
cell must repair the glycocalyx that covers it. However, this is not always possible, especially when
the repair capacity of such an exo-endo-cytoplasmic cell structure is limited due to cellular senescence.
If the gene repair system remains activated, the damaged glycocalyx can be reconstituted via
specific transcriptional pathways in response to oxidative and reductive stresses. Despite the experimental
evidence in favour of this hypothesis, many of the recently published reviewrs on long
COVID do not mention the use of therapeutic treatments via specific 'oxidative eustress'. In fact,
mild and controlled oxidative stress is able to induce an activating response to cellular damage repair
processes. This perspective aims to draw the attention of researchers to these aspects in an attempt to
address this gap in understanding.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Although recommended isolation periods for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been shortened as the pandemic has subsided, prolonged Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding remains common in immunocompromised patients. This study estimated the probability of viral clearance in these patients based on elapsed days and specific risk factors.


METHODS
We prospectively enrolled immunocompromised patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from January 2022 to May 2023 during the Omicron variant era. We collected weekly respiratory specimens for viral load measurement and culture. We identified significant predictors of viral culture negative conversion through univariate and multivariate analyses and estimated viral clearance probabilities using a Cox time-varying proportional hazard model.


RESULTS
Among 70 patients with serial 319 respiratory specimens with positive SARS-CoV-2 genomic polymerase chain reaction results that underwent cell culture, ∼69% (48) had haematologic malignancies and 31% (22) underwent solid organ transplants. B-cell depleting agents and viral copy number significantly influenced viral culture negative conversion. The probability of culture-negative conversion for immunocompromised patients not treated with B-cell-depleting agents increased over time, with over 90% achieving negative conversion by Day 84. Patients treated with B-cell depleting agents showed lower conversion rates. By Day 84, <90% of patients with cycle threshold values 23-28 [4.85-6.35 log copies/mL] achieved culture-negative conversion. The results indicate more prolonged shedding than in patients without B-cell depletion.


CONCLUSION
Estimating SARS-CoV-2 clearance probabilities based on specific risk factors can guide individualised isolation decisions for immunocompromised patients, tailoring policies to each patient's delayed viral clearance risk.">

        <tr id="Host immunity in sepsis has features of hyperinflammation together with progressive immunosuppression, particularly among CD4 T cells, that can predispose to secondary infections and ineffectual organ recovery. Metabolic and immunologic dysfunction are archetypal findings in critically ill patients with sepsis, but whether these factors are mechanistically linked remains incompletely defined. We characterized functional metabolic properties of human CD4 T cells from critically ill patients with and without sepsis and healthy adults. CD4 T cells in critical illness showed increased subset-specific metabolic plasticity, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) acquiring glycolytic capacity that stabilized suppressive markers FOXP3 and TIGIT and correlated with clinical illness severity. Single-cell transcriptomics identified differential kynurenine metabolism in Tregs, which was validated ex vivo as a mechanism of Treg glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring. These findings underscore immunometabolic dysfunction as a driver of CD4 T cell remodeling in sepsis and suggest therapeutic avenues to restore an effective immune response.">

        <tr id="Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of pathophysiological conditions linked to the disruption of metabolic processes associated with energy storage and consumption. Approximately one-third of adults in the United States are currently diagnosed with MetS. Patients with MetS experience higher mortality rates following SARS-CoV-2 infection and exhibit poor vaccine efficacy following influenza virus vaccination compared to metabolically healthy individuals. However, the specific impact of MetS on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination has not been widely studied. To address this gap, we utilized high-fat diet feeding to establish a murine model of MetS, in which mice exhibit the same diagnostic criteria for MetS as human patients. We then used high-fat diet-induced MetS mice and regular chow diet-fed wild-type mice to analyze immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we monitored mice for disease severity, measured levels of virally induced inflammation, and quantified viral titers in various tissues. Our results indicate that MetS mice exhibit accelerated mortality post-infection, accompanied by elevated mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokine transcripts at sites of infection. Additionally, MetS alters the degree of viral replication across various tissues. Furthermore, our vaccination studies revealed that MetS reduces the potency of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Delta variant. Overall, our findings suggest that MetS exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and diminishes vaccine efficacy, underscoring the need for tailored strategies to protect individuals with MetS from severe outcomes following infection and vaccination. Impact This study represents the first detailed account of the failure to generate protective neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mice with metabolic syndrome (MetS) following vaccination. The insights gained from this research inform future vaccine design and aid in identifying individuals at greater risk of breakthrough infections. By specifically isolating the risk associated with MetS, rather than obesity alone, these findings lay the groundwork for future investigations aimed at enhancing immune responses in individuals with MetS. This work is highly relevant to a broad audience, as it addresses a critical unmet need in vaccine development and provides essential guidance for the rational design of vaccines to protect vulnerable populations affected by MetS.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic and devastating health crisis. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), and the exaggerated immune response resulting from infection with this disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality.  Activation may have a contribution to disease severity.A case study was carried out in order to find the association between COVID-19, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2. The effect of age, sex, smoking, diabetic and hypertention on the level of the studied cytokines were evaluated. Inaddition, the influnce of COVID-19 severity on TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2 levels were studied. Blood samples were collected from 50 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who visited of Al-Hussein Teaching hospital and 50 control people, during the period from (May -November 2021). The ages of the patients ranged from (Twenty two years to seventy six years). The serum samples were used in detection of TNF-α , IL-8 and IL-2  by using ELISA test. Then   the collected data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 11. The results showed that that the most affected age group was (40-60) years old followed by less than 40 years old and more than 60 years old. The numbers of patients were 29, 11 and 10 respectively. Most of COVID-19 patients were male (56 %:28), while the rest cases were females (44%:22). The mean values of the studied cytokines in COVID-19 patients in both sex and all age groups were more than their counter parters in H.C group. The effect of main risk factors for severe and long COVID-19 include age, sex, smoking, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension) on variations in the level of studied cytokines of the host were found significantly. Moreover, the effect of COVID-19 severity on the studied cytokines was highly significants. The maximum values of cytokines were obtaind in critical degree followed by severe and moderate severity.  It is concluded from the study's results that patients infected with severe SARS-CoV-2 experience increasing proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 that produce signaling the initial phase of cytokine storm. Thus, further studies should be conducted to use the studied cytokines inhibitors as a treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

This review discusses the mechanisms by which these RNA respiratory viruses activate inflammasomes, emphasizing the roles of various signaling pathways and components involved in this process. Additionally, we highlight the specific interactions between viral proteins and inflammasome sensors, elucidating how these viruses manipulate the host immune response to facilitate infection.

Microglia are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system and are readily infected by HIV. Microglia are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HAND. In order to identify pathways that may contribute to neuropathogenesis in HAND, we infected induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) with HIV and defined gene expression changes over an 8-day period. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were studied in parallel in order to identify common pathways stimulated in myeloid cells versus the unique aspects of microglia infection. Infection of iMG led to the induction of a robust early inflammatory response triggered within hours of infection, a pattern that differed significantly from that seen in MDMs. Remarkably, gene expression changes in iMG reproduced many of the characteristic genetic signatures previously identified in brain tissues obtained from individuals clinically diagnosed with HAND. Inflammatory activation representing interferon-mediated signaling, TNF/NF-κB, and IL-6/JAK/STAT pathways were particularly prominent over the time course of infection. Interferon-mediated signaling led to enhanced expression of multiple HIV restriction factors, yet viral replication in iMG remained robust. These findings suggest that HIV infection of microglia is the key cellular driver of neuroinflammation in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals. Further studies of infected microglia are likely to aid in understanding the pathogenesis of HAND and in evaluating therapeutic strategies to limit or eliminate HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. Author Summary Persons living with HIV frequently develop debilitating problems with brain function that are collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Treatment with antiretroviral drugs to control HIV has largely eliminated the most severe form of HIV-related brain dysfunction, HIV encephalitis, but a significant proportion of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiviral therapy still develop significant problems with cognitive function. Microglia are the major macrophage-like cells of the brain and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Inflammation in the brain following infection contributes to damage to neurons and is the likely source of decline of brain function. This study used microglia that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, termed iMG, to study the kinetics of gene expression changes in HIV-infected microglia, and compared those changes to those seen in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). iMG were found to be easily infected with a macrophage-tropic HIV strain and exhibited a rapid increase in gene expression associated with inflammatory signaling through interferon- and tumor necrosis factor/NF-kappa B-mediated pathways. Remarkably, the patterns of gene expression in microglia strongly overlapped with gene expression signatures derived from brain tissue samples of HIV patients with HAND. The rapid onset and magnitude of inflammation as well as induction of specific HIV restriction factors differed from that seen in infected macrophages/MDMs. These studies reinforce the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of HAND and provide insights into HIV-microglia interactions that can help direct interventions to reduce inflammation and preserve brain function.">

        <tr id="Globally, sepsis remains a major health issue, with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) being a leading cause of mortality. MODS, a severe condition often seen in intensive care units, typically results from infections or trauma and involves complex pathophysiological processes requiring various clinical interventions. Although infections are the main triggers, the mechanisms driving MODS remain unclear. To investigate the transition of sepsis to MODS, we generated a single cell RNA sequencing dataset comprising 86,839 immune cells from pediatric sepsis patients at the clinical onset of MODS patients and age-matched controls, identifying 22 distinct cell types. A cluster of S100 genes, located in the same genomic region, was highly expressed in neutrophils in MODS patients, demonstrating strong diagnostic potential across cohorts (AUC=0.94– 0.99) and potential as therapeutic targets. We found that many B and T cells showed heightened inflammation and increased apoptotic activity during early MODS. Additionally, specific transcription regulators and surface proteins associated with inflammation and S100 regulations were uniquely expressed in MODS. Pseudotime analysis revealed distinct S100 gene expression patterns between controls and MODS. Cell-cell interaction analysis highlighted dendritic cells as key mediators, enhancing communication between plasma cells and Vδ T cells while activating inflammatory and immunosuppressive pathways. We also analyzed 116,803 immune cells from adult MODS patients, revealing stronger immune dysregulation compared to pediatric MODS, including altered S100 gene expression, and enhanced cell-cell interactions. These findings suggest that S100 genes may serve as a marker for MODS. Furthermore, insights gained from adult MODS could improve our understanding of rare pediatric MODS and contribute to the development of better therapeutics for all MODS patients.">

        <tr id="The betacoronavirus genus contains five of the seven human coronaviruses, making it a particularly critical area of research to prepare for future viral emergence. We utilized three human betacoronaviruses, one from each subgenus—HCoV-OC43 (embecovirus), SARS-CoV-2 (sarbecovirus), and MERS-CoV (merbecovirus)—, to study betacoronavirus interactions with the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway of the integrated stress response (ISR)/unfolded protein response (UPR). The PERK pathway becomes activated by an abundance of unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to phosphorylation of eIF2α and translational attenuation. We demonstrate that MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV-2 all activate PERK and induce responses downstream of p-eIF2α, while only SARS-CoV-2 induces detectable p-eIF2α during infection. Using a small molecule inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation, we provide evidence that MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 maximize viral replication through p-eIF2α dephosphorylation. Interestingly, genetic ablation of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein (GADD34) expression, an inducible protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-interacting partner targeting eIF2α for dephosphorylation, did not significantly alter HCoV-OC43 or SARS-CoV-2 replication, while siRNA knockdown of the constitutive PP1 partner, constitutive repressor of eIF2α phosphorylation (CReP), dramatically reduced HCoV-OC43 replication. Combining GADD34 knockout with CReP knockdown had the maximum impact on HCoV-OC43 replication, while SARS-CoV-2 replication was unaffected. Overall, we conclude that eIF2α dephosphorylation is critical for efficient protein production and replication during MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 infection. SARS-CoV-2, however, appears to be insensitive to p-eIF2α and, during infection, may even downregulate dephosphorylation to limit host translation.">

Using transcriptional profiles we analyzed the impact of SARS-CoV2 infection and/or vaccination in pregnant people and their infants longitudinally Transcriptome changes in pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination Modular analysis of pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination compared with healthy uninfected controls. Red dot: overexpression, blue dot: underexpression, white/empty space no difference vs controls Methods Multicenter observational study of SARS-CoV-2-infected and/or vaccinated pregnant people and their infants. Pregnant people (infected [n=91], vaccinated [n=42], infected-and-vaccinated [n=14], controls [n=22]) and their infants (n=81, 38,14, 11, respectively) were included. Maternal blood samples were collected during different trimesters and at delivery. Infant blood samples were collected longitudinally from birth (< 72 hours), at 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months of age. Whole blood RNA was extracted for RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic data analyzed with R Transcriptional analysis of immune system development in early life Modular gene expression scores were analyzed longitudinally of individual infant samples. Red: higher expression, white: lower expression. D1-3: days 1 to 3, W1: week 1, M1: month 1, M3: month 3, M6: month 6 Results Compared with uninfected controls, interferon and plasma cells genes were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute infection (< 14 days), but underexpressed with earlier infection or vaccination during pregnancy (Figure 1). Newborns < 72 h of age (from all groups) showed significantly increased expression of erythrocytes, neutrophils, and inflammation genes. Expression of T/cytotoxic cell genes started to be observed at 1 week, while expression of B cells, plasma cells and interferon genes was observed at 3 months of age (Figure 2). Quantitative gene set enrichment analysis showed that compared to controls, infants from infected and/or vaccinated mothers had increased expression of interferon, while neutrophil, and adaptive immunity genes were decreased (Figure 3) SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination of pregnant people shaped immune profiles of their infants Fold changes of gene sets in infants compared to controls are shown (adjusted p-value <0.01) from quantitative gene set enrichment (QuSAGE) analysis. Red: overexpression, blue: underexpression. Infant groups are defined by maternal infection and/or vaccination status at delivery. Conclusion Interferon and plasma cells related pathways were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute COVID-19, while vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection earlier in pregnancy were associated with under-expression of both innate and adaptive immunity genes. The infant immune system changed rapidly in the first few days of life, as different immune programs followed separate time trajectories.

        <tr id="Oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) are critical for neuronal support functions, including myelination and remyelination. Emerging evidence reveals their active roles in neuroinflammation, particularly in conditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study explores the inflammatory translatome of OLCs during the early onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an established MS model. Using RiboTag-based RNA sequencing in genetically modified Olig2-Cre RiboTag mice, we identified 1,556 upregulated and 683 downregulated genes in EAE OLCs. Enrichment analysis indicated heightened immune-related pathways, such as cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and antigen presentation, while downregulated genes were linked to neuronal development and myelination. Notably, OLCs expressed cytokines/chemokines, and their receptor, highlighting their active involvement in neuroinflammatory signaling. Functional studies demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling in OLCs exacerbates EAE pathology by enhancing antigen presentation and chemokine production, whereas interferon-beta (IFN-β) signaling showed minimal impact. These findings provide novel insights into the inflammatory role of OLCs in EAE and suggest therapeutic potential in targeting OLC-mediated neuroinflammation for MS and related disorders.">

        <tr id="We have previously shown that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1E2 envelope glycoprotein can regulate HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) activity through disruption to NF-κB activation. This response is associated with upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S, M, and E but not the N structural protein can perform similar downmodulation of HIV-1 LTR activation, and in a dose-dependent manner, in both HEK293 and lung BEAS-2B cell lines. This effect is highest with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S strain and decreases over time for the subsequent emerging variants of concern (VOC), with Omicron providing the weakest effect. We developed pseudo-typed viral particle (PVP) viral tools that allowed for the generation of cell lines constitutively expressing the four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and utilising the VSV-g envelope protein to deliver the integrated gene construct. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed on cells expressing S, E, M, or N to determine cell activation status. Gene expression differences were found in a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IF16, IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15, as well as for a number of heat shock protein (HSP) genes, including HSPH1, HSPA6, and HSPBP1, with all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. There were also differences observed in expression patterns of transcription factors, with both SP1 and MAVS upregulated in the presence of S, M, and E but not the N protein. Collectively, the results indicate that gene expression patterns associated with ER stress pathways can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein expression. The results suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate an array of cell pathways, resulting in disruption to NF-κB signalling, hence providing alterations to multiple physiological responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection induces interferon (IFN) response by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we show that the bulk of the IFN-I release comes from pDC sensing of infected cells and not cell-free virions. Physical contact (or conjugates) between pDCs and infected cells is mediated through CD54-CD11a engagement, and such conjugate formation is required for efficient IFN-I production. Interestingly, CD11a is inducible on infected epithelial cells when they are co-cultured with PBMCs, thus allowing for potentially bidirectional cross-talks between CD54 and CD11a, which further amplify the sensing. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) are sensed less efficiently than the Wuhan ancestral strain (LSPQ1), but the mechanisms driving the defect are different among the VOCs. CD11a induction on infected cells is correlated with their ability to form cell conjugates with pDCs. Impaired sensing of the Alpha variant is linked to reduced CD11a induction on infected cells and to fewer conjugates formed with pDCs. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into how SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are sensed by pDCs and reveal that this process is targeted by some VOCs to limit IFN-I production.


IMPORTANCE
Type I interferons (IFN-I) represent an important component of the host's innate defense against initial SARS-CoV-2 infections. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce large quantities of IFN-I upon recognition of viral particles or infected cells. This study shows that pDCs sense infected cells more efficiently than viral particles, leading to a higher production of IFN-I. Physical contact between a pDC and an infected cell is critical to this process; the interaction is mediated via CD11a and ICAM-1 complex and potentially is bidirectional. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have evolved to limit the IFN response through different mechanisms. For the Alpha variant, reduced level of CD11a on infected cells is linked to less contact with pDCs and decreased IFN-I release. Overall, our study characterizes some of the early steps involved in pDC-mediated response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and shows that these processes are targeted by VOCs to likely limit IFN-I response and enhance viral spread.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), is a major concern due to its astonishing prevalence and high fatality rate, especially among elderly people. Patients suffering from COVID‐19 may exhibit immunosuppression in the initial stage of infection, while a cytokine storm can occur when the disease progresses to a severe stage. This inopportune immune rhythm not only makes patients more susceptible to the virus but also leads to numerous complications resulting from the excessive production of inflammatory factors. A20, which is widely accepted as a pivotal regulator of inflammation, has been shown to be implicated in the processes of antiviral responses and immunosuppression. Thus, A20 may participate in regulating the pathological processes of COVID‐19. Methods This narrative literature review summarizes recent evidence on the mechanisms of A20 in regulating the pathological processes of COVID‐19. We also downloaded single‐cell RNA‐seq data sets from healthy individuals and patients with varying severities of COVID‐19 from the NCBI GEO database to further dissect A20's regulatory mechanisms of these intricate cytokine pathways that are closely associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results A20 might be one of the most critical anti‐infectious and anti‐inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19. It effectively suppresses the immune damage and inflammatory storm caused by viral infection. Conclusions Understanding the relationship between A20‐regulated signaling pathways and pathological processes of COVID‐19 can provide insight into potential targets for intervention. Precise regulation of A20 to induce antiviral activity and an anti‐inflammatory response could mediate the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 and could become an effective treatment.">

While anti-Aβ antibodies provide hope in targeting Aβ plaques in the brain, there still remains a lack of understanding regarding the cellular responses to these antibodies in the brain. In this study, we sought to identify the acute effects of anti-Aβ antibodies on immune responses. To determine cellular changes due to anti-Aβ antibody exposure, we intracranially injected 14 mo APP male and female mice with anti-Aβ IgG1 (6E10) or control IgG1 into the cortex. After 24 h or 3 d, we harvested the cortex and performed a glial cell-enriched preparation for single-cell sequencing. Cell types, proportions, and cell-to-cell signaling were evaluated between the two injection conditions and two acute timepoints. We identified 23 unique cell clusters including microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells, neurons, oligos/OPCs, immune cells, and unknown. The anti-Aβ antibody-injected cortices revealed more ligand–receptor (L–R) communications between cell types, as well as stronger communications at only 24 h. At 3 d, while there were more L–R communications for the anti-Aβ antibody condition, the strength of these connections was stronger in the control IgG condition. We also found evidence of an initial and strong communication emphasis in microglia-to-nonparenchymal immune cells at 24 h, specifically in the TGFβ signaling pathway. We identify several pathways that are specific to anti-Aβ antibody exposure at acute timepoints. These data lay the groundwork for understanding the brain's unique response to anti-Aβ antibodies.">

A comparison of the effectiveness and therapeutic usage of drugs as reported in clinical trials and reports was made at different disease levels as well. Clinical studies indicate that Annual SZ with mild side effects was more affordable and might be more effective than other medications. Additionally, Annual SZ was capable of reducing the lev-els of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as viral attachment and RNA replication.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The majority of COVID-19 infections in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological (Heme-Onc) diagnoses are mild with good outcome compared to adults. Postulated reasons include cross-protection from immunity against seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV’s), subdued inflammatory responses in children than in adults and differences in humoral and T-cell responses. The objectives of this study are to compare antibody responses against HCoV’s, anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral, T-cell, and inflammatory profiles between Heme-Onc children with COVID-19 and control groups. Methods Binding IgG antibodies against Spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2, four HCoV’s (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), quantitative levels of 21 cytokines and 9 chemokines (multiplexed solid-phase electrochemiluminescence assay by Meso Scale Diagnostics/MSD) were compared among five cohorts: 1) children with Heme-Onc diagnoses and COVID-19 (n = 41) 2) healthy children with COVID-19 (n = 21) 3) adults with COVID-19 (n = 14) 4) children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) [n = 23] and 5) healthy children without COVID-19 (n = 12). Additionally, T-cell responses against S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using ELISpot in Heme-Onc children a group of healthy children COVID-19. Results Anti-S antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV were significantly lower in children in Heme-Onc and healthy children with COVID-19 compared to adults with COVID-19 (Figure 1). The concentration of eight pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly lower in Heme-Onc and healthy children compared to adults with COVID-19 and children with MIS-C. The responder T-cell frequency varied between 0 and 860/100,000 PBMC at study enrollment in children with Heme-Onc diagnoses. Conclusion In this single-center study, cross-protection from HCoV antibodies is an unlikely mechanism to explain mild COVID-19 in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological diagnoses. Subdued inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be one of the factors for the mild COVID-19 disease phenotype in children.

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes have been implicated as central mediators of neuroinflammatory processes in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory roles and interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a compartmentalized microfluidic chip coculture platform. This novel platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of fluidically isolated microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 hours. The glial activation and crosstalk were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were successfully generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic chip platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Notably, the levels of secreted inflammatory mediators were altered under coculture conditions, revealing significant glial crosstalk. Utilization of our microfluidic coculture platform facilitated the study of microglial migration and glial activation within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Microglia migrated efficiently toward the astrocyte compartment, and the chemoattractant adenosine diphosphate (ADP) notably increased microglial migration within this platform. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation of the microfluidic chip cocultures successfully recapitulated glial crosstalk, revealing unique responses. This crosstalk was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3 in the cocultures, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate molecular crosstalk between inflammatory microglia and astrocytes, providing evidence of how glial cells orchestrate responses during neuroinflammation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the microfluidic coculture platform developed in this study for microglia and astrocytes provides a more functional and enhanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.">

        <tr id="The long-term effects of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations on adaptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Understanding the behavior of B cells during infection and vaccination is important for determining protective humoral immunity. We evaluated the profile of humoral immunity and B cell pool in individuals who were acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2, recovered from COVID-19, or received two doses of the AZD1222 vaccine. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these individuals were subjected to in vitro stimulation to promote the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and the ELISpot evaluated the abundance of pan and SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1-reactive IgG+ ASC. Stimulated PBMCs were characterized using flow cytometry. Culture supernatants were assessed for soluble B-cell-activating factors. The IgA and IgG for the S1 were evaluated through ELISA. Results: The recovered individuals displayed a robust S1 ASC compared to acute and vaccinated individuals. Although the frequency of total B cells or B cell subsets did not vary among the groups, plasmablast cells were increased in naïve and double-negative B cells in the acute, recovered, and vaccinated individuals. Similar IgA and IgG production appeared to be present in the acute and recovered individuals. During vaccination, more IgG is produced than IgA. In acute patients, BAFF levels were positively correlated with total B cells and IgG+ plasmablast cells but negatively correlated with IgA+ plasmablast cells. Conclusions: Vaccination and natural infection with COVID-19 induce a differential profile and functionality of B cells. We suggest that new vaccines against COVID-19 incorporate molecular adjuvants that regulate B lymphocyte functionality and consider the beneficial aspects of the IgA response in addition to IgG.">

        <tr id="The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection is reported to begin with the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human body through droplets, entering the lungs, and binding to the ACE-2 receptor. Meanwhile, activated macrophages stimulate an immune and inflammatory response, activating the coagulation cascade. This activation in COVID-19 patients can exacerbate the condition and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The coagulation cascade is influenced by the expression of related genes, including F3, F5, F8, F12, F13A1, VWF, THBD, PROC, PROCR, PROS1, SERPINE1, A2M, and PLAUR. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022, with 22 mild COVID-19 cases, 35 moderate-to-severe cases, and 20 healthy control individuals from Dr. M. Djamil Padang General Hospital in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Coagulation gene expression data using the RNA-Seq method with transcriptomic analysis were collected and recorded in transcript per-million (TPM) units. The results showed a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes in moderate-to-severe compared to mild COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The analysis of log2 folds change has a statistically significant increase observed in the expression of coagulation genes and a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes among moderate-to-severe and mild patients, as well as healthy controls. The results underscored the impact of COVID-19 infection on the activity of coagulation cascade genes, which could influence the condition of patients and serve as a reference for therapy.">

        <tr id="HIV infection exerts profound and long-lasting neurodegenerative effects on the central nervous system (CNS) that can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we used single-nucleus multiome sequencing to map the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of postmortem human brains from 13 healthy individuals and 20 individuals with HIV who have a history of treatment with ART. Our study spanned three distinct regions—the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and ventral striatum—enabling a comprehensive exploration of region-specific and cross-regional perturbations. We found widespread and persistent HIV-associated transcriptional and epigenetic alterations across multiple cell types. Detailed analyses of microglia revealed state changes marked by immune activation and metabolic dysregulation, while integrative multiomic profiling of astrocytes identified multiple subpopulations, including a reactive subpopulation unique to HIV-infected brains. These findings suggest that cells from people with HIV exhibit molecular shifts that may underlie ongoing neuroinflammation and CNS dysfunction. Furthermore, cell–cell communication analyses uncovered dysregulated and pro-inflammatory interactions among glial populations, underscoring the multifaceted and enduring impact of HIV on the brain milieu. Collectively, our comprehensive atlas of HIV-associated brain changes reveals distinct glial cell states with signatures of pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic dysregulation, providing a framework for developing targeted therapies for HIV-associated neurological dysfunction.">

 Evidence suggest that about 10-30% of individuals with COVID-19 develop a chronic condition following the acute phase, now referred to as the post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID1,2. Dysregulation of the immune system and chronic inflammation, which are among the primary drivers of PASC3, are at the heart of immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) pathology. As PASC still remains underexplored in the IMID population, we aimed to carry out a population-based cohort study to estimate the risk of PASC in patients with IMIDs compared to those without a recorded diagnosis of an IMID.



 We used the Danish national registers to identify all individuals with a recorded positive SARS-CoV-2 test between 01 January 2020 and 01 January 2022. Individuals with IMIDs including Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondylarthritis (SpA), and psoriasis were identified using ICD-10 codes and medication with indication (only for psoriasis) before 01 January 2020. The IMID and non-IMID groups were matched (1:2) on age, sex, municipality of residence, and calendar period. With the first positive date as index, individuals were followed up until a PASC diagnosis, emigration, death or end of the study period (31 July 2022), whichever is earliest. If an individual from the non-IMID group is diagnosed with an IMID, they are censored. Cox proportional hazard regression was carried out to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with adjustments for age, sex and Charlson Comorbidity Index in all analyses. Subgroup analysis by vaccination status, hospitalization for COVID-19, IMID medication, IMID group, and SARS-CoV-2 variant were carried out.



 We compared 25,889 IMID patients to 51,778 individuals without an IMID for the risk of PASC. The median age was 48 (IQR: 35, 61) and 56% were women. Psoriasis was the largest group constituting 47% of the IMID group. During a median follow-up of 7.7(IQR:7.1-16.3) months, a total of 753 cases of PASC were reported in the entire cohort. The Cox proportional hazard regression showed an increased risk of PASC in the IMID group (HR: 1.51, 95% CI: (1.30-1.74)) compared to the non-IMID group. SpA (HR: 1.91, 95% CI:(1.21-3.01)), RA (HR: 1.72, 95% CI:(1.25-2.37)) and psoriasis (HR: 1.50, 95% CI:(1.21-1.85)) were individually associated with an increased risk of PASC.



 This cohort study using nationwide registers showed an increased risk of PASC in individuals with an IMID and in spondylarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis individually. The results underline the need for clinicians to be aware of the chronic impact of early SARS-CoV-2 infection that IMID patients are living with at present.

        <tr id="Introduction COVID-19 was less severe in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared with Europe and North America. It is unclear whether these differences could be explained immunologically. Here we determined the levels of ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 peptide-specific IFN-{gamma} producing cells, and levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines over the first month of COVID-19 diagnosis among Kenyan COVID-19 patients from urban and rural areas. Methods Between June 2020 and August 2022, we recruited and longitudinally monitored 188 COVID-19 patients from two regions in Kenya, Nairobi (urban, n = 152) and Kilifi (rural, n = 36), with varying levels of disease severity {-}- severe, mild/moderate, and asymptomatic. IFN-{gamma} secreting cells were enumerated at 0-, 7-, 14- and 28-days post diagnosis by an ex vivo enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay following in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with overlapping peptides from several SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A multiplexed binding assay was used to measure the levels of 22 plasma cytokines and chemokines. Results Higher frequencies of IFN-{gamma}-secreting cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides were observed on the day of diagnosis among the asymptomatic compared to the patients with severe COVID-19. Higher concentrations of 17 of the 22 cytokines and chemokines measured were positively associated with severe disease, and in particular interleukin (IL)-8, IL-18 and IL-1ra (p<0.0001), while a lower concentration of SDF-1 was associated with severe disease (p<0.0001). Concentrations of 8 and 16 cytokines and chemokines including IL-18 were higher among Nairobi asymptomatic and mild patients compared to their respective Kilifi counterparts. Conversely, the concentrations for SDF-1 were higher in rural Kilifi compared to Nairobi (p=0.012). Conclusion In Kenya, as seen elsewhere, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were associated with severe COVID-19, while an early IFN-{gamma} cellular response to overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides was associated with reduced risk of disease. Living in urban Nairobi (compared with rural Kilifi) was associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected individuals showed either mild symptoms or were paucisymptomatic, with severe impact on human health, revealing heightened risk and direct effects on health. Among various factors contributing to complications, bacterial and fungal co-infection remains very common and is highly lethal. This narrative review aims to focus on the collective role of gut microbiota and mycobiota in COVID-19. Fungal infection has been identified as a key risk factor for the spread of COVID-19 and mortality. Gut mycobiomes diversity and abundance also vary due to the different types of SARS-CoV-2 variant infection. Their cross-talk plays a vital role in immune regulation and disease severity, with an emphasis on understanding the altered condition as a predictive marker. On the other hand, the gut microbiome is well known for shaping metabolic functions, generating immune responses, and deciphering the signal to decide the healthy state and disease condition of an individual. Immune response during COVID-19 infection was also linked with metabolites produced by the gut microflora, specifically amino acids, sugar metabolites, and neurotransmitters. The cross-talk between gut microbiota and gut mycobiota for clinical implications in terms of early detection, identification of the disease severity, and even therapeutic alternatives will open newer avenues. A deep dive understanding of the cross-talk between the microbiome and mycobiome, and their role in immune response will take scientific discovery knowledge to develop gut-targeted safe therapeutic approaches in the form of FMT (fecal microbiota transplantation) probiotics, peptides, antibacterial, and antifungal metabolites. Overall cross-talk and immune interplay are critical determinants of host immunity, providing insights into their role and key take home lessons for better management of crisis in the future.">

In particular, the involvement of activated mast cells (MC) in the highly angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing small bowel, the largest lymphoid organ, might be significant in PCS pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of activated MC, residual SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and zonulin (a marker for impaired intestinal integrity), in the context of PCS, examining peripheral blood (PB) and terminal ileum (TI) 2 years post-infection. Methods In this cross-sectional, controlled study, paired PB and TI samples were obtained from 21 SARS-CoV-2 convalescents with (PCS+) and 11 without PCS (PCS−). CD117+CD25+ activated MC and residual S protein were assessed using fluorescent immunohistochemistry on sections of the the ileal tissue from the gut. Tryptase, zonulin and S protein were quantified in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry assessed frequencies of T-cells (CD3+CD4+ (TCD4), CD3+CD8+ T-cells (TCD8)) and CCR7±CD27± memory subsets (TCM: T central memory, TEM: T effector memory) on mononuclear cells of PB and TI. Results Among PCS+ and PCS−, median follow up was 22 and 18 months post-infection, 81% and 73% were female, and 57% and 55% had pre-existing conditions of which arterial hypertension, chronic lung disease and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent. Compared to PCS−, PCS+ expressed significantly more MC (p< 0.0001) in ileal sections, along with elevated levels of tryptase (p=0.0196) and zonulin (p=0.024) in PB. S protein, by contrast, was undetectable in PB of PCS+ and PCS− even 2 years post-infection. In TI however, the frequency of tissue-resident S protein-infected cells was significantly higher in PCS+ compared to PCS− (p=0.0135). Interestingly, systemic tryptase levels correlated positively to elevated TCM in TI (r=0.7407, p=0.0034). Conclusion Elevated MC activity and S protein in the TI, along with increased tryptase and zonulin levels in PB, indicate ongoing immune activation and intestinal damage in the TI of PCS+. Understanding the role of tissue-resident MC in PCS pathogenesis could lead to targeted therapies. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a respiratory disease that can range in presentation from mild symptoms to severe conditions such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus, spreads through aerosols and respiratory droplets. It enters human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, leading to various complications, including significant alterations in red blood cells and potential disruptions in haemoglobin function and oxygen transport. During infection, the interaction between hypoxia, inflammation, and haematopoiesis affects erythropoiesis at multiple levels. Hypoxia and inflammation, resulting from lung complications and a reduced red blood cell count, influence the regulation of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron levels in the blood. Elevated hepcidin levels are associated with hypoxia and the suppression of erythroferrone, a hormone that normally inhibits hepcidin production. Despite high levels of inflammation, patients in intensive care units often exhibit elevated ferritin levels, which, rather than indicating low hepcidin, suggest disrupted iron metabolism and the development of severe anaemia. Iron is kept in stores, likely due to paradoxically high hepcidin levels, which explains the elevated ferritin measurements. An increase in immature blood cells and a decrease in CD71+ erythroid cells are observed. The elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells highlight their dual role in modulating hyper-inflammation and immune response during disease progression. This review examines the pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 affects red blood cell production and the haematopoietic system and how it triggers cytokine storms through interleukins, immature blood cells, and CD71+ erythroid cells. Understanding these processes provides novel pathways for managing haematological manifestations and immune responses in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Microglia play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and display remarkable plasticity in their response to inflammatory stimuli. However, the specific signaling profiles that microglia adopt during such challenges remain incompletely understood. Traditional transcriptomic approaches provide valuable insights, but fail to capture dynamic post-translational changes. In this study, we utilized time-resolved single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to measure distinct signaling pathways activated in microglia upon exposure to bacterial and viral mimetics-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the immunomodulatory role of astrocytes on microglial signaling in mixed cultures. Microglia or mixed cultures derived from neonatal mice were treated with LPS or Poly(I:C) for 48 h. Cultures were stained with a panel of 33 metal-conjugated antibodies targeting signaling and identity markers. High-dimensional clustering analysis was used to identify emergent signaling modules. We found that LPS treatment led to more robust early activation of pp38, pERK, pRSK, and pCREB compared to Poly(I:C). Despite these differences, both LPS and Poly(I:C) upregulated the classical reactivity markers CD40 and CD86 at later time points. Strikingly, the presence of astrocytes significantly blunted microglial responses to both stimuli, particularly dampening CD40 upregulation. Our studies demonstrate that single-cell mass cytometry effectively captures the dynamic signaling landscape of microglia under pro-inflammatory conditions. This approach may pave the way for targeted therapeutic investigations of various neuroinflammatory disorders. Moreover, our findings underscore the necessity of considering cellular context, such as astrocyte presence, in interpreting microglial behavior during inflammation.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has presented formidable challenges to global health since its emergence in late 2019. While primarily known for respiratory symptoms, it can also affect the ocular surface. This review summarizes the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on ocular surface immunity and inflammation, focusing on infection mechanisms, immune responses, and clinical manifestations. Ocular symptoms, though uncommon, include conjunctivitis, dry eye, and blurred vision. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in ocular surface epithelial cells, facilitating viral entry, replication, and local dissemination. The innate immune responses involving corneal epithelial cells and immune cells are discussed, alongside mechanisms of antigen presentation and adaptive immunity. The review also examines the roles of cytokines and chemokines in mediating ocular surface inflammation and explores the impact of cytokine storms and chronic inflammation on ocular health. Additionally, the interplay between systemic and ocular immune responses is highlighted, analyzing how systemic COVID-19 inflammation influences ocular surface health. These insights underscore the broader implications of COVID-19 beyond localized ocular infection. By consolidating current findings, this review aims to guide preventive and therapeutic strategies while identifying directions for future research to mitigate the ocular consequences of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in nearly 630 million cases and 6.60 million fatalities globally, as of November 2022. SARS-CoV-2, a species of the Coronaviridae family, has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome as well as four main structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) required for viral entrance into target cells. The spike protein (S) influences this entry through interactions with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized numerous variants of concern (VOCs) that involve Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, having multiple mutations within the spike protein, altering infection rates and immunity evasion. The Omicron variant, featuring 50 mutations, mainly within the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), has a higher transmission rate as compared to other variants. This study focused on two recent Omicron subvariants, XBB.1.5 and CH.1.1, which are known for their high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor. Utilizing an in silico strategy, a total of 1.65 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to assess the stability as well as binding details of these subvariants along with the wild-type Omicron variants. The comprehensive structural stability of the spike protein–hACE2 complexes was evaluated by using numerous parameters including root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, the binding free energies have been determined using the MM-GBSA approach to provide insights into the binding affinities of these variants. Evaluation revealed that the unbound mutant frameworks (SM and TM) displayed higher degrees of instability in comparison to the wild-type (WT) Omicron variant. In contrast, the WT–hACE2 of the Omicron variant complex was less stable than the subvariants, SM–hACE2 and TM–hACE2 complexes. Binding free energy calculations employing MM-PBSA disclosed higher binding energy values for the SM–hACE2 and TM–hACE2 complexes, suggesting a more stable and ordered binding interaction. The observed increase in transmissibility of the new XBB.1.5 and CH.1.1 subvariants, in comparison to the wild-type Omicron, appears to be due to this greater stability and ordered binding.">

        <tr id="Introduction Despite the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, inflammatory and/or thrombotic episodes have been reported. Since the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the endothelium remains uncertain, our objective was to assess endothelial activation status before and 90 days after the third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Methods A prospective longitudinal study was conducted at University General Hospital of Albacete, involving 38 healthy health-care workers. Serum levels of endothelial markers (endocan and sVCAM-1) and spike S1-specific IgG antibodies were determined before and at 7, 15, 24 and 90days following vaccination. To analyze each participant´s individual response, we calculated relative increases/decreases (delta values) in endothelial markers and antibodies concentrations compared to their pre-vaccination levels. Results We identified two significantly distinct profiles of endothelial markers response, characterized by either increased or decreased serum levels of endocan and sVCAM. Incremental and decremental response groups did not differ in terms of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and influenza vaccine co-administration. However, these responses were significantly associated with the relative spike-specific antibody production. Specifically, the greatest relative increase in antibodies was found in the decremental responders. Additionally, the higher delta antibody production was observed in non-previously infected individuals Conclusion Administration of the BNT162b2 booster vaccine triggered a non-homogenous response of endothelial function markers among the study participants. Our findings improve the understanding of individual responses to the mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine, which could be useful in assessing the need for booster doses, particularly in population at risk of vascular complications.">

        <tr id="From December 2019 to March 2020, the human population faced a new coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, which led to global morbidity and high mortality worldwide. Typical features of coronavirus infection tended to resemble a seasonal infection over time. Despite this fact, it has been proven that, after acute disease, numerous disorders are detected in the patients, manifesting both with general health disturbances and as complications of pre-existing chronic diseases, including allergic syndrome. On the basis of these findings, the study of post-COVID syndrome became an important aspect of the ongoing COVID-19 research. It has been shown over recent decades that the number of people suffering from various types of allergic reactions is growing every year. Therefore, the studies in allergic pathology in the structure of post-COVID syndrome are among the most pressing issues. In addition to studying exacerbations of allergic reactions, a thorough analysis has shown that adverse reactions caused by coronavirus infection are viewed from new aspects, being characterized by functional disorders of acquired and innate immune response, causing increasingly severe consequences for the immune system and the whole body. Currently, the features of humoral immune response in post-COVID syndrome have not been sufficiently studied. In this respect, we have evaluated the features of humoral immunity in patients with post-COVID syndrome, with clinically confirmed allergic anamnesis. The study revealed changes in humoral immune system, indicating that the most significant changes are observed in post-COVID patients with a burdened history of allergies, thus requiring a more detailed study of immune status in order to develop an individualized approach to immunocorrection of these disorders in this group of patients.">

        <tr id="Background. Research results on the immune response and cytokine profile in children with the new coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 are contradictory and insufficient, which necessitates the need to understand the nature of the course of the disease depending on age and severity of the infection. The importance of assessing risks and predicting the consequences of a new coronavirus infection in childhood makes the study of serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines relevant.The aim. To study the level of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in newborns during the acute period of a new coronavirus infection to determine the characteristics of the immune response and identify prognostic criteria for the course of the infectious process.Materials and methods. The article presents the results of a study of the level of pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) in newborns (n  =  44) hospitalized with a confirmed new coronavirus infection of varying severity. The study was conducted during the acute period of COVID-19.Results. Cytokine concentrations in the blood serum of newborns were determined by enzyme immunoassay. In newborns in the acute period of a new coronavirus infection, regardless of the severity, there is a decrease in serum concentrations of interleukin-1β, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor α, interferon (INF)  γ and  CRP compared with the control group. The level of INF-α in the blood serum of newborns of both the main and control groups did not have significant differences.Conclusions. The cytokine profile in newborns with the new coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 may be due to inhibition of the innate immune system, which requires further research in this direction and increased pediatric attention to this category of children.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is intricately related to the reprogramming of host metabolism. However, existing studies have mainly focused on peripheral blood samples and barely identified specific metabolites that are critically involved in the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current small-scale study, we performed metabolic profiling in plasma (n = 61) and paired bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples (n = 20) using parallel two-dimensional liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS). In addition, we studied how an identified metabolite regulates the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. The results unveiled distinct metabolome changes between healthy donors, and moderate and severe patients in both plasma and BALF, indicating that locations and disease severity play critical roles in COVID-19 metabolic alteration. Notably, a vital metabolite, indoxyl sulfate, was found to be elevated in both the plasma and BALF of severe COVID-19 patients. Indoxyl sulfate selectively induced TNF-α production, reduced co-stimulatory signals, and enhanced apoptosis in human monocytes. Moreover, its levels negatively correlated with the strength of co-stimulatory signals and antigen presentation capability in monocytes of COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that the levels of indoxyl sulfate could potentially serve as a functional biomarker to monitor COVID-19 disease progression and guide more individualized treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is associated with respiratory disease in children. Between 2014 and 2018, biennial EV-D68 outbreaks coincided with peaks of a polio-like neurologic condition called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). We hypothesized that specific mutations within the currently circulating B3 clade of EV-D68 impacted neurovirulence. However, recovery of these strains from infectious clones by published methods proved unsuccessful. Therefore, we tested different cell lines, reagents, and conditions to enhance efficiency of recombinant (r)EV-D68 rescue. In this study, we present a tractable rescue system to define virulence determinants in B3 clade strains. Using this approach, we successfully rescued historic and contemporary rEV-D68 strains to high titer after limited cell culture passage. All strains in our study replicated efficiently in the parental RD cell line and in human respiratory epithelial cell lines, with BEAS-2B cells exhibiting greater permissivity than A549 cells. While B2 and B3 clade strains could infect the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, the neurovirulent B2 clade strain rUSA/IL/2014-18952 was more dependent on neuron differentiation than B3 clade strains and replication was not sustained under multi-cycle growth conditions. Conversely, replication of rUSA/IL/2014-18952 was more efficient in human spinal cord organoids, which model the cellular heterogeneity of the spinal cord, while replication of B3 clade strains was more modest. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed infection, with viral antigen colocalized with neurons. These findings suggest shifting dynamics of EV-D68 neurovirulence and provide a critical platform for further assessment of viral determinants of neurovirulence in B3 clade strains. IMPORTANCE Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) can cause acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a debilitating neurological condition of the spinal cord in children. Identifying viral determinants of EV- D68 neuropathogenesis is critical to understanding recent shifts in AFM prevalence; however, these investigations are limited to a small subset of infectious clones distantly related to currently circulating B3 clade strains. In this study, we leverage improved rescue strategies to characterize recombinant (r)EV-D68 strains from the dominant B3 clade. While all rEV-D68 replicate efficiently in the parental cell line and in human respiratory epithelial cells, B3 clade strains achieved greater titers in cultured neurons than a neurovirulent B2 clade strain, with less dependence on neuronal differentiation state. All B3 clade strains established infection in human spinal cord organoids, but replication varied between strains. Therefore, our study presents a tractable rescue system to begin to dissect viral determinants of shifting neurotropism within contemporary EV-D68 clades.">

        <tr id="The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post-stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p-MCAO]) is utilized to profile single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain-resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post-stroke disease-related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease-associated microglia, possibly arising from pre-existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post-stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

        <tr id="Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, poses a significant global health challenge, especially among high-risk populations. This study investigates the temporal dynamics of pulmonary gene expression during S. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia using a murine model to elucidate host-pathogen interactions and identify potential biomarkers of disease severity. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we analyzed lung tissues at early (1h, 8h) and acute infection (2d, 3d), as well as post-resolution (30d) time-points. At 2 days post-infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed heightened innate immune responses, including chemokine and interferon signaling pathways. By 30 days post-infection, gene expression profiles and histological changes normalized, reflecting resolution of inflammation. Stratifying mice into recovered, sick, and moribund phenotypes during the acute infection phase highlighted significant transcriptional distinctions, including upregulated pro-inflammatory genes and Schlafen family members. Arginase 1 emerged as a predictive marker of disease severity, with elevated expression detectable as early as 8 hours post-infection. Comparative analyses revealed significant overlap between transcriptional responses in our model and those from a Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia model, implicating conserved pathways, such as IL-17 and Toll-like receptor signaling. Additionally, murine DEGs correlated with human plasma proteins associated with severe CAP, including CCL8 and CD14, suggesting translational relevance. This study underscores phase-specific transcriptional reprogramming during pneumococcal pneumonia and identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in severe CAP cases.">

Immune system may participate in the development and progression of the disease as indicated by altered activity in IPF sufferers. This study investigates the immune response to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in patients with IPF compared to healthy controls, with a particular focus on evaluation of antibody responses, interferon-gamma release, cytokine profiling and a broad panel of immune cell subpopulations. IPF patients without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 had undetectable levels of anti-N IgG antibodies, highlighting their lack of previous infection. After vaccination, IPF patients showed a significant increase in anti-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies, though their levels were lower compared to healthy controls and convalescent IPF patients. Additionally, IPF patients exhibited altered proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T lymphocytes (Teffs) before and after vaccination. Specifically, IPF patients had higher percentages of Tregs with a Th2 phenotype and Th17 Tregs, along with reduced proportions of Th1/17 Tregs. Teffs in IPF patients showed a decrease in Th1-like and Th2-like populations after vaccination. Moreover, IPF patients demonstrated elevated populations of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc) before vaccination and increased levels of γδ Tc cells throughout the study. Alterations in cytokine profiles were also observed, IPF patients showed higher levels of IL-6 and IL-22 compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest a distinct immune response in IPF patients to the COVID-19 vaccine, characterized by differences in antibody production, T cell differentiation and cytokine secretion compared to healthy individuals.">

        <tr id="Background Atherosclerosis involves complex interactions between lipids, immune cells, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and fibroblasts within the arterial wall. While significant advances in single-cell technologies have shed light on the roles of immune cells and VSMCs in plaque development, fibroblasts remain underexplored, leaving critical gaps in understanding their contributions to disease progression and plaque stability. Comprehensive characterization of fibroblast phenotypes in atherosclerosis is essential to unravel their diverse functions and to distinguish between subsets that may play protective versus pathogenic roles in the disease process. Methods Here, we utilized CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing) to comprehensively profile fibroblast diversity in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 0, 8, 19, and 26 weeks, representing distinct stages of disease progression, enabling a detailed phenotypic characterization of fibroblasts throughout the course of atherosclerosis development. Results We identified four distinct fibroblast subpopulations, including a myofibroblast population closely resembling VSMC-derived chondromyocytes. The proportions of these fibroblast subsets exhibited a modest decline as atherosclerosis progressed. Through multimodal analysis, we identified CD26 as a highly expressed and specific marker for one of these fibroblast subpopulations, distinguishing it from other subsets. Using a combination of flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that CD26+ fibroblasts predominantly reside in the adventitia of healthy arteries. During atherosclerosis progression, these cells expand into the intima and primarily localize within the fibrous cap of the lesion. Conclusions Our multi-omic analysis highlights the phenotypic diversity and dynamic changes of fibroblasts during atherosclerosis progression. Among these, CD26+ fibroblasts emerge as a distinct subpopulation that expands within atherosclerotic lesions and may play a critical role in promoting plaque stability through their migration into the fibrous cap.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 global pandemic, leads to a wide variety of responses among patients. Some of them present a very severe phenotype, while others only experience mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. This differential prognosis is tightly related to the inflammatory status of the patient. Although WHO declared the end of the emergency, the pandemic caused a great socio-sanitary impact in all countries. Thus, the possible outbreak of new biological diseases in the future makes it necessary to deepen the knowledge of this uncontrolled immune response and look for reliable biomarkers to help us predict its potential health impact. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) as lipoxins are endogenous mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid in the resolution stage of any inflammatory process. These lipids have pro-resolving actions in several pathological models, including reducing NF-κB-mediated inflammation, and inducing the antioxidant response through the Nrf-2 pathway. Thus, although a potential relationship has already been suggested between low levels of SPMs and COVID-19 severity, their true role as a predictive biomarker is still unknown. Methods and results In this study, we have analyzed by ELISA the serum levels of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in a representative Spanish cohort. We found reduced levels in deceased patients when compared to mild or severe patients, concomitant with a decrease in the LXA4 biosynthetic pathway and an increase in its degradation pathway. Furthermore, we have studied the correlation between the levels of this SPM and several pathology indicators, finding a significant correlation between increased LXA4 levels and a better prognosis of the patients. Conclusion We propose to measure systemic LXA4 as a new promising biomarker to predict the survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and presumably to other viruses that can affect humanity in the future.">

        <tr id="Maladaptive host metabolic responses to infection are emerging as major determinants of infectious disease pathogenesis. However, the factors regulating these metabolic changes within tissues remain poorly understood. In this study, we used toxoplasmosis, as a prototypical example of a disease regulated by strong type I immune responses, to assess the relative roles of local parasite burden, local tissue inflammation and the microbiome in shaping local tissue metabolism during acute and chronic infection. Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This protozoan infects the small intestine and then disseminates to nearly every organ in the acute stage of infection, before establishing chronic infection in the skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and brain. We compared metabolism in eleven sampling sites in C57BL/6 mice during the acute and chronic stage of T. gondii infection. Strikingly, significant metabolic changes were observed in the large intestine and colon during chronic infection, organs not associated with T. gondii persistence. Overall, major spatial mismatches were observed between metabolic perturbation and local parasite burden for both disease stages. In contrast, a stronger association with indicators of type I immune responses was observed, indicating a tighter relationship between metabolic perturbation and local immunity, than with local parasite burden. In addition, we observed significant changes in microbiota composition with infection, and candidate microbial origins for multiple metabolites impacted by infection. These findings highlight the metabolic consequences of toxoplasmosis across different organs, and their regulators. Importance Inflammation is a major driver of tissue perturbation. However, the signals driving these changes on a tissue-intrinsic and molecular level are poorly understood. This study evaluated tissue-specific metabolic perturbations across eleven sampling sites following systemic murine infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Results revealed relationships between differential metabolite enrichment and variables including inflammatory signals, pathogen burden and commensal microbial communities. These data will inform hypotheses about the signals driving specific metabolic adaptation in acute and chronic protozoan infection, with broader implications for infection and inflammation in general.">

        <tr id="CNS-resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells populate the haematoma in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), but the contribution of these cell populations to injury and repair has been controversial. To better characterise myeloid cell changes over time, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a unique paired dataset of live haematoma and peripheral blood samples from 10 ICH patients. This work presents a temporal atlas of ICH myeloid populations and identifies population-specific in-situ transcriptional drivers. In addition to distinct populations of activated microglia and TNF-low microglia, we found a unique and highly activated population of CD14+ monocytes in the haematoma. Perturbation analysis comparing haematoma-associated monocytes to shared populations in blood and haematomas identified TNF signalling as the primary driver of their activation. Employing a custom temporal trajectory analysis based on the embeddings of a single-cell foundation model, we found that this TNF response in monocytes was transient, peaking early after haemorrhage and decreasing over the ensuing 48 hours. Our analysis further identified a transient population of highly activated microglia as the likely source of TNF during the acute stage of ICH. Acute TNF signalling in CD14+ monocytes associated with better adjusted outcomes both in our and external cohorts. Overall, our results suggest that acute TNF signalling between transient populations of activated microglia and unique haematoma-associated monocytes could potentially be beneficial in recovery after ICH.

 Proinflammatory cytokines significantly contribute to the initiation and propagation of inflammation and to impaired functional recovery in neuroinflammatory diseases. We identified that microglia express and secrete interferon alpha-inducible protein 27 like 2A (Ifi27l2a) in response to inflammatory signals. However, the functional role of Ifi27l2a in inflammation has not been well defined. Through a combination of cell culture and
 in vivo
 mouse models, we now demonstrate that Ifi27l2a acts as a novel hub protein that regulates proinflammatory responses in microglia.


 Methods:
 Endotoxemia was induced by LPS administration in aged mice to determine the subsequent circulating Ifi27l2a protein levels in the plasma. Sim-A9 cells and primary microglia were stimulated with recombinant Ifi27l2a (rIfi27l2a) at concentrations of 10 and 100 ng/ml to investigate whether Ifi27l2a promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and conversion of microglial phenotype. RNA-seq was performed on primary microglia to define transcriptional changes induced by Ifi27l2a as well as alterations in cellular signaling associated with proinflammatory microglia.


 Results:
 Systemic injection of LPS increased circulating Ifi27l2a protein levels in the plasma of aged mice (
 Veh:
 38.1,
 LPS:
 122.1 pg/ml, n=4-5, p<0.05). To investigate how exogenous Ifi27l2a modulates microglial phenotypic changes, we treated microglia to rIfi27l2a. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were elevated by rIfi27l2a treatment in both Sim-A9 and primary microglia (n=6-8, p<0.05). Notably, treatment with rIfi27l2a increased the ATP production, which LPS did not, as assessed by Seahorse cell analysis (n=10-21, p<0.05). In addition, inflammation marker genes (
 Il1b
 ,
 Tnfa
 , and
 Mmp9
 ) were significantly elevated in rIfi27l2a-treated microglia compared to the control. Transcriptional analysis of rIfi27l2a treatment with RNA-seq (n=5) revealed that a set of proinflammatory genes, including
 Mmps
 , were highly upregulated. The data also showed that microglial phagocytosis-related genes and disease-associated microglia (DAM)-related genes were suppressed by rIfi27l2a.


 Conclusions:
 These data suggest a novel role for Ifi27l2a in brain inflammation through the shifting of microglia toward a proinflammatory phenotype and away from the reparative DAM phenotype. We propose that selective disruption of Ifi27l2a signaling may provide a new therapeutic strategy to reduce harmful inflammation and improve functional outcome following stroke.

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) remains the major cause of mortality and morbidity, causing approximately 1.3 million deaths annually. As a highly successful pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has evolved numerous strategies to evade host immune responses, making it essential to understand the interactions between Mtb and host cells. G-protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, contributes to the regulation of pro-inflammatory reactions and the migration of innate immune cells, such as macrophages. Its role in mycobacterial infection, however, has not yet been explored. We found that GPR84 is induced in whole blood samples from tuberculosis patients and Mycobacterium marinum (Mm)-infected macrophage models. Using a Mm-wasabi infection model in mouse tails, we found that GPR84 is an important determinant of the extent of tissue damage. Furthermore, from our studies in an in vitro macrophage Mm infection model, it appears that GPR84 inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and increases intracellular lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, thereby promoting intracellular bacterial survival. Our findings suggest that GPR84 could be a potential therapeutic target for host-directed anti-TB therapeutics.">

However, GAS is also found asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of infants. GAS infections, including pharyngitis and invasive pneumosepsis, pose significant public health concerns. Streptokinase, a key virulence factor of GAS, activates human plasminogen, facilitating bacterial dissemination. Plasminogen, traditionally known for its role in fibrinolysis, may also modulate host immune responses. We therefore aim to investigate systemic and cardiac immune cell responses during pneumonia and pneumosepsis with GAS in a murine infection model. The interaction of streptokinase with human plasminogen is species-specific, therefore the murine pneumosepsis model was developed in a transgenic mouse strain that produces human plasminogen. The data show a critical role of human plasminogen for GAS colonization and systemic spread via the nasopharynx. Due to pneumosepsis blood immune cell profiles and plasma protein levels significantly alters, indicating potential biomarkers for distinguishing local from systemic infection. In the hearts of animals with invasive infection proinflammatory immune cells significantly increased and likely displaced resident healing macrophages. The established pneumosepsis model is useful to study the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying local and invasive pneumonia caused by GAS and to investigate new therapeutic options.">

        <tr id="In multiple sclerosis (MS), microglia and macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in determining the balance among demyelination, neurodegeneration, and myelin repair. Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the lack of therapies aimed at promoting remyelination and slowing disease progression for individuals with MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, shifts the transcriptional programs of microglia and CNS-associated macrophages from a proinflammatory phenotype to a regenerative phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 stimulated scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that prevented the activation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes while also promoting neuroaxonal health and oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment of mice with bryo-1 augmented remyelination after a focal demyelinating injury.

 It has been hypothesized that inflammation related to SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect cancer cell proliferation, without having a direct oncogenic effect. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with the ACE2 receptor. ACE-2 over-expression has been found in many kinds of malignancies, including rectum adenocarcinoma (ADC) and in IBD patients. IBD-associated CRC (colorectal cancer) arises from a specific carcinogenic pathway involving chronic inflammation which is distinct from the traditional pathways.
 IBD patients characteristically had right colon cancer and a higher incidence with respect to the general population, which had declined over time.



 We observed a sudden increase in CRC incidence. Between June 2022 and May 2024, 6 of our patients presented with ano-rectal cancer (4 in the lower rectum and two in the anal canal). Biopsies were reviewed as usual and an extra study searching for coronavirus protein was also performed. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using OMNIS Automated System (AGILENT), and monoclonal antibody anti-SARS-COV-2 clone 1A9 from Gene Tex. Inc (USA) at 1:100. All patients had signed consent.



 They were male, ages 38-62, one smoked and one was an ex-smoker, duration of the disease 3-31 years, two were overweight. 3 Crohn’s Disease (CD) and 3 Ulcerative Colitis (UC). CD: A3L1B2, A2L2B1 and A1L3B3p. UC: 2 extensive and one distal. All on different treatments: adalimumab and azathioprine, azathioprine and steroids, filgotinib, two were on vedolizumab and one was only on oral mesalamine (never biologics). 5/6 were in endoscopical remission. They were diagnosed of ADC of distal rectum and two of perianal ADC. Four of them were mucinous ADC (including the two perianal ones), one conventional low grade infiltrant ADC (pT1) in distal rectum-anus, and the sixth with rectal intramucous ADC. 100% had received COVID vaccines (variable type) and had had COVID infections. Biopsies: all frequent viruses were negative, whereas coronavirus was found in all cases, with a diffuse cytoplasmic and granular pattern. See figures 1 and 2.



 The incidence of CRC in our patients in the past two years is relevant. The type of tumour and its locations also calls our attention, as well as the fact that all tumours have SARS-COV-2 protein abundance. Whether an epiphenomenom, part of the cause or a trigger for CRC of this specific type, will have to be dilucidated in prospective studies. We do not know if coronavirus stays longer in the bowel mucosae of our IBD patients (long covid) or maybe just in a subpopulation. It is of clinical relevance no matter whether the coronavirus is a mere spectator or an actor. Many questions arise with just these six patients, which we hope to answer in the future.

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can lead to a variety of clinical outcomes, including severe congenital abnormalities. The phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors AXL and TIM-1 are recognized as critical entry factors for ZIKV in vitro. However, it remains unclear if and how ZIKV regulates these receptors during infection. In this study, we investigated AXL and TIM-1 expression in human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells, glioblastoma U87 cells, and embryonic stem cells-derived trophoblast following ZIKV infection. We found that both the Asian strain FSS13025 and the African strain MR766 of ZIKV downregulate AXL, with a milder effect on TIM-1. We identified several ZIKV proteins, notably envelope (E), NS2A, NS3, and NS4B, that contribute to this downregulation. Notably, treatment with lysosomal inhibitor NH4Cl or the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) mitigated the AXL/TIM-1 downregulation, indicating autophagy’s involvement in the process. Importantly, this downregulation facilitates sustained viral replication and promotes viral spread by preventing superinfection and limiting cell death, which is also associated with impaired innate immune signaling. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which ZIKV downregulates entry factors to enhance prolonged viral replication and spread. AUTHOR SUMMARY Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with severe birth defects, yet the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors AXL and TIM-1 and discovered that they promote ZIKV entry but are downregulated by the virus infection. We identified several ZIKV proteins involved in AXL and TIM-1 down-regulation through an autophagy-mediated process. Mechanistically, this loss of surface receptors protects host cells from superinfection and cell death, while dampening the innate immune response, ultimately promoting viral spread. Our results contribute to a better understanding of ZIKV’s interactions with host cells and offer insight into viral entry, innate signaling, and pathogenesis.">

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to significant global morbidity and mortality. While many patients recover, a subset experiences persistent pulmonary complications, including post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF), a condition characterized by irreversible lung scarring and impaired gas exchange. Several risk factors, such as advanced age, male sex, pre-existing lung disease, and severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, contribute to its development. Radiological assessments, particularly high-resolution computed tomography, reveal hallmark features such as reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and parenchymal bands, aiding in diagnosis. Current therapeutic strategies include corticosteroids, antifibrotic agents (pirfenidone, Nintedanib), and immunosuppressants, though no standardized treatment exists. Pulmonary rehabilitation and supplemental oxygen therapy offer symptomatic relief and improved functional outcomes. Future research explores novel agents, including buloxibutid, saracatinib, sirolimus, and resveratrol, as potential antifibrotic therapies. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and evolving treatment strategies for PCPF, emphasizing the need for continued research to optimize patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="HERVs (Human endogenous retroviruses) are remnants of ancient exogenous retroviruses that have integrated into the human genome, particularly in germ-line cells. Among these, the envelope protein gene HERV-W env (Human endogenous retroviruses W family envelope protein), located on chromosome 7 and primarily expressed in the human placenta, has been closely linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, as well as autoimmune diseases and cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the abnormal expression of cytokines as a key factor in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Notably, elevated serum levels of IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta) in schizophrenia, a cytokine associated with inflammation, are a characteristic feature of pyroptosis—a form of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death. Although previous research has observed significant upregulation of pyroptosis-related genes such as CASP1 (Caspase-1), NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3), and IL1B (interleukin 1 beta) in the serum of schizophrenia patients, and extensive neuron pyroptosis has been documented in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, the occurrence of neuron pyroptosis in schizophrenia remains uncertain. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying pyroptosis in schizophrenia and its potential connection with HERV-W env have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the expression levels of pyroptosis-related genes, specifically CASP1, GSDMD (Gasdermin D), and IL1B, were significantly elevated in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between HERV-W env expression and the levels of CASP1/GSDMD/IL1B in these patients. Experimental evidence further demonstrated that HERV-W env promoted the activation of Caspase-1 and the cleavage of Gasdermin D, leading to increased release of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and IL-1β. Importantly, inhibitors targeting NLRP3, CASP1, and GSDMD significantly reduced the releases of LDH and IL-1β induced by HERV-W env, whereas BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) inhibitors did not have a notable effect. This suggests that HERV-W env induces CASP1–GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis through the NLRP3–CASP1–GSDMD signaling pathway. As pyroptosis is increasingly recognized for its connection to neurodegenerative diseases, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal pyroptosis mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of HERV-W env. Additionally, it explores the potential facilitation of HERV-W env in the development of schizophrenia via pyroptosis, proposing that certain pyroptosis indicators could serve as potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. Based on our existing research results and the findings of previous researchers, we infer that HERV-W env acts as a bridge in the onset and progression of schizophrenia. Furthermore, HERV-W env may serve as a potential target for the clinical treatment of schizophrenia, suggesting that monoclonal antibody therapy targeting HERV-W env could represent a novel approach to managing this disease.">

        <tr id="Despite global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity has not been able to completely elimination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And although the acute period of COVID-19 is currently relatively mild, there is still a risk of the post-COVID syndrome with persistent multisystem disorders development, which necessitates restorative treatment during the convalescence period.
The objective: to assess the severity of oxidative stress and the possible role of immune complex lesions in convalescents after COVID-19 in relation to the severity of the disease and the timing of examination after the acute period, as well as to analyze the dynamics of the detected changes under the influence of rehabilitation treatment.
Materials and methods. 91 convalescents after COVID-19 were examined. In patients aged 21 to 67 years, the manifestations of COVID pneumonia were diagnosed during the acute period. Among them, 46 patients had a mild course of COVID-19, 31 persons had a moderate course, and 14 patients had a severe course. Within 1–3 weeks after inpatient treatment 55 patients were admitted to a rehabilitation treatment course, and after 2–3 months – 36 persons. The comparison group included 25 convalescents after community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. As a control for laboratory indicators, 27 practically healthy individuals were examined.
During the examination the disorders in the lipid peroxidation (LPO) – antioxidant protection (AOP) system were studied, examining the level of LPO end products – Schiff bases (SB) and the AOP enzyme – catalase in the blood. To quantify the imbalance in the ROS-AOD system, the oxidative stress severity index (OSI) was calculated. The presence of endogenous intoxication was assessed by determining the average mass molecules (AMM) in the blood serum by spectrophotometric method. To assess the development of immune complex lesions, the level of circulating immune complexes (CIC) was determined.
The main component of the treatment was the use of haloaerosol therapy (dry aerosol media of rock salt with a given concentration and dispersion) – 18–20 sessions per course. In addition, rehabilitation treatment included a gentle regimen with regular therapeutic physical exercises, the necessary basic bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy (according to indications).
Results. Before the treatment in the convalescents there were the signs of pronounced oxidative stress and endotoxemia, which was manifested by a significant increase in the level of BS in the control group and in patients after bacterial pneumonia. These changes were combined with a significant increase in MSM content by 1.3 times and CIC level by 2.1 times, which causes the development of tissue damage and post-covid syndrome. The detected changes did not significantly depend on the timing of the examination and were pronounced even with a mild course of COVID-19.
After the course of rehabilitation treatment all patients, regardless of the severity of the disease, had inhibition of lipoperoxidation, which was accompanied by an increase in catalase activity and was confirmed by a significant OSI decrease, a decrease in endotoxemia and CIC level. The positive dynamics of the studied indicators was somewhat more pronounced with a mild course of COVID-19, but by the end of the course of treatment, none of the indicators reached the control level. This fact confirms the pathogenetic significance of the studied processes in the development of post-covid syndrome and determines the need to improve rehabilitation treatment of convalescents after COVID-19.
Conclusions. After COVID-19 disease the convalescents have disturbances in the redox balance with the development of oxidative stress, manifestations of endogenous intoxication and immune complex reactions, which do not significantly depend on the severity of the acute period of the disease and persist for a long time, which may be the basis for the development of post-covid syndrome.
The rehabilitation therapy based on haloaerosol therapy leads to an improvement in clinical and functional indicators and a decrease in the manifestations of oxidative stress and endotoxemia, but does not provide full compensation for these changes, which determines the need to correct the rehabilitation complex with an emphasis on restoring oxidative homeostasis.">

        <tr id="ATP-gated purinergic P2X7 receptors are crucial ion channels involved in inflammation. They sense abnormal ATP release during stress or injury and are considered promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention. However, despite their predominant expression in immune cells such as microglia, there is limited information on P2X7 membrane expression and regulation during inflammation at the single-molecule level, necessitating new labeling approaches to visualize P2X7 in native cells. Here, we present X7-uP, an unbiased, affinity-guided P2X7 chemical labeling reagent that selectively biotinylates endogenous P2X7 in BV2 cells, a murine microglia model, allowing subsequent labeling with streptavidin-Alexa 647 tailored for super-resolution imaging. We uncovered a nanoscale microglial P2X7 redistribution mechanism where evenly spaced individual receptors in quiescent cells undergo upregulation and clustering in response to the pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide and ATP, leading to synergistic interleukin-1β release. Our method thus offers a new approach to revealing endogenous P2X7 expression at the single-molecule level.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes acute coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) that has emerged on a pandemic level. Coronaviruses are well-known to have a negative impact on the lungs and cardiovascular system.

Although, SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals often show no or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Novel CoV-2 infection in 2019 resulted in viral pneumonia as well as other complications and extrapulmonary manifestation. ARDS is also linked to a higher risk of death.

Although SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been responsible for pneumonia,
recent studies indicate that it also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain, among other vital organs.
Evidence suggests that this virus may travel retrogradely from the olfactory epithelium to brain
stem sections, causing neurological impairments in a significant number of individuals. Individuals
with severe COVID-19 frequently have elevated cytokines that promote inflammation and acute
respiratory failure and require frequent supportive ventilation. These factors are believed to contribute
to cognitive deterioration. Severe neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients include- paralysis,
stroke, cranial nerve deficits, delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, and meningitis. The virus, with
its unique structure, and a high binding affinity for the human enzyme ACE2 (used as an entry point
by the virus), contributes significantly to its deadly nature. Furthermore, to address the outbreak effectively,
researchers worldwide must develop precise treatment strategies. Advancing new diagnostic
and treatment methods to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on cognition requires further
epidemiological research and clinical experience. Additionally, by understanding the virus's
impact on cognitive functions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted treatments to alleviate
these severe neurological consequences.

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC or “Long COVID”), includes numerous chronic conditions associated with widespread morbidity and rising healthcare costs. PASC has highly variable clinical presentations, and likely includes multiple molecular subtypes, but it remains poorly understood from a molecular and mechanistic standpoint. This hampers the development of rationally targeted therapeutic strategies. The NIH-sponsored “Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery” (RECOVER) initiative includes several retrospective/prospective observational cohort studies enrolling adult, pregnant adult and pediatric patients respectively. RECOVER formed an “OMICS” multidisciplinary task force, including clinicians, pathologists, laboratory scientists and data scientists, charged with developing recommendations to apply cutting-edge system biology technologies to achieve the goals of RECOVER. The task force met biweekly over 14 months, to evaluate published evidence, examine the possible contribution of each “omics” technique to the study of PASC and develop study design recommendations. The OMICS task force recommended an integrated, longitudinal, simultaneous systems biology study of participant biospecimens on the entire RECOVER cohorts through centralized laboratories, as opposed to multiple smaller studies using one or few analytical techniques. The resulting multi-dimensional molecular dataset should be correlated with the deep clinical phenotyping performed through RECOVER, as well as with information on demographics, comorbidities, social determinants of health, the exposome and lifestyle factors that may contribute to the clinical presentations of PASC. This approach will minimize lab-to-lab technical variability, maximize sample size for class discovery, and enable the incorporation of as many relevant variables as possible into statistical models. Many of our recommendations have already been considered by the NIH through the peer-review process, resulting in the creation of a systems biology panel that is currently designing the studies we proposed. This system biology strategy, coupled with modern data science approaches, will dramatically improve our prospects for accurate disease subtype identification, biomarker discovery and therapeutic target identification for precision treatment. The resulting dataset should be made available to the scientific community for secondary analyses. Analogous system biology approaches should be built into the study designs of large observational studies whenever possible.">

        <tr id="Germ-line deletion of a conserved enhancer (the Fms intrinsic regulatory element, FIRE) in the mouse Csf1r locus causes congenital absence of microglia. Homozygous FIRE deletion on a C57BL/6J background leads to perinatal lethality and hydrocephalus (HC) in surviving pups. We developed a congenic C57BL/6J line with defined regions of non-C57BL/6J genomic DNA, increased postnatal viability and reduced incidence of HC. Both perinatal lethality and HC were eliminated in F2 mice following outcross of the congenic line to CBA/J or BALBc/J backgrounds. To assess the impacts of microglial deficiency in postnatal neurodevelopment we analyzed deep total RNA-seq data from multiple brain regions of wild-type and Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mice. Aside from the loss of microglial-specific transcripts, we found no significant alterations in relative abundance of any cell-type or region-specific transcriptomic signature. Transcripts associated with endosome/lysosome function, which are enriched in microglia, were not affected, suggesting compensatory expression by other cell types. On the C57BL/6J x CBA/J F2 background, congenital absence of microglia did not affect motor activity, behavior or myelination up to 7 months of age but was associated with astrocytosis and calcification in the thalamus. In the congenic C57BL/6J Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mouse line, intraperitoneal transfer of wild-type bone marrow cells (BMT) at weaning led to complete repopulation of the brain with microglia-like cells without giving rise to monocytic intermediates. Our results suggest novel strategies for treatment of microglial deficiency.">

        <tr id="The development of new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic potential of microvascular endothelium. A specific feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the post-COVID syndrome that is characterised by long-term impairment of various organs and systems. The immune pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis requires special attention due to their baseline pro-inflammatory status. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of novel coronavirus infection on the risk of chronic systemic hyper-inflammation and low-grade systemic inflammation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Two main groups consisted of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had survived COVID-19 (mild form) 3 months ago, or at earlier terms, including the subjects with post-COVID symptoms and those free of these symptoms. The comparison group included patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without a history of COVID-19. The control group was presented by healthy blood donors. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFá), D-dimers, troponin I, cortisol, and endothelin I (ET-I) were measured in patients’ plasma by immunoassay technique. On the basis of these markers, we calculated integral indices of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) – the levels of reactivity (RL), and chronic systemic hyper-inflammation (ChSI). Low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) was diagnosed in absence of ChSI, but in cases of simultaneous increase of D-dimer levels 250 ng/ml and ET-I levels 90 pg/ml in the patient. 
The most prevalent symptoms of post-COVID in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were tachycardia, arthralgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, which correspond to the population-wide data. By all empirical parameters, the groups of tuberculosis patients were comparable to each other (p 0.05) and significantly differed from control group. However, evaluation of integral indexes is more crucial for assessing the ‘systemic’ origin of the process. Thus, 23-50% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed subcritical SIR (RL = 1-2), being a feature of ChSI in 7.1-13.6% of cases (both in COVID-19 reconvalescents and non-COVID-19 patients). Meanwhile, all patient groups did not show significant difference in the frequency of LGSI and endothelial dysfunction (p 0.05). However, there was a trend towards an increase of these scores in the following sequence: tuberculosis without COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 + post-COVID syndrome. 
Most patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are not characterized by the development of chronic systemic hyperinflammation. LGSI is the most probable feature of general pathology in tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis infection sufficiently contributes to the development of LGSI, since the frequency and severity of LGSI and its individual manifestations are independent on the new coronavirus infection and signs of post-COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="Flaviviruses represent a serious global health threat, infecting millions annually with high rates of cross-infection among different flaviviruses, yet no broad-spectrum antiviral therapy currently targets these pathogens. Through biological big data analysis, we observed a significant downregulation of Canopy FGF Signaling Regulator 3 (CNPY3), a positive regulator of defense responses, in flavivirus-infected patients, with the level of downregulation correlating with infection severity. This observation was validated in cellular and animal models. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that flaviviruses hijack the RNA-binding protein Human antigen R (HuR) to destabilize CNPY3 mRNA via adenine-uridine-rich elements (AREs), thus downregulating CNPY3 expression and promoting viral replication. Our findings identify CNPY3 as a novel antiviral mediator essential for the TLR-mediated type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway in defense against flaviviruses. In vitro, CNPY3 overexpression reduced DENV and ZIKV replication, confirming its antiviral role. To explore therapeutic potential, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating CNPY3 mRNA (LNP-CNPY3), and early administration in flavivirus-infected mice improved survival, reduced viral loads, and attenuated neuroinflammation by enhancing antiviral and interferon responses. Together, these findings establish CNPY3 as a critical antiviral target and support LNP-CNPY3 as a promising therapeutic approach against flavivirus infections.">

        <tr id="Abstract Parasitic helminths secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) into their host tissues to modulate immune responses, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We demonstrate that Ascaris EVs are efficiently internalised by monocytes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increase the percentage of classical monocytes. Furthermore, EV treatment of monocytes induced a novel anti‐inflammatory phenotype characterised by CD14+, CD16−, CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2−) and programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1)+ cells. In addition, Ascaris EVs induced T cell anergy in a monocyte‐dependent mechanism. Targeting professional phagocytes to induce both direct and indirect pathways of immune modulation presents a highly novel and efficient mechanism of EV‐mediated host‐parasite communication. Intra‐peritoneal administration of EVs induced protection against gut inflammation in the dextran sodium sulphate model of colitis in mice. Ascaris EVs were shown to affect circulating immune cells and protect against gut inflammation; this highlights their potential as a subject for further investigation in inflammatory conditions driven by dysregulated immune responses. However, their clinical translation would require further studies and careful consideration of ethical implications.">

In this study, we performed high-throughput single-cell mass cytometry on peripheral blood samples from 10 COVID-19 patients and four healthy donors to analyze their immune status at acute and convalescence phases. During the acute stage, the proportion of neutrophils increased significantly while natural killer (NK) cells decreased. In contrast, during the convalescence phase, the proportion of plasma cells decreased from the acute stage of disease onset and was lower than normal. The proportions of B, mast and plasma cell subsets decreased significantly with the process of disease recovery. Further analysis of the subsets of major immune cell types in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations in different stages showed that in the acute stages of disease progression, the T helper cell 1 (Th1), IgD+ B and neutrophil subsets increased in COVID-19 patients, especially in symptomatic patients, while the central memory CD4+T cells (CD4 TCM), mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) and NK cell subsets decreased significantly, especially in symptomatic patients. Then CD4 TCM and MAIT returned to normal levels at the recovery phase. Dynamic assessment displayed that the immune imbalance at the onset of COVID-19 could be corrected during recovery. Our study provides additional information on the immune status of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations in different stages.

Compounds from the library that reduced phagocytosis by ≥2 standard deviations across the library without cytotoxicity were validated in secondary screens, with 28 of them further confirmed to reduce phagocytosis by 50% or more. Image-based morphological measurements were calculated to measure the degree of ramified vs. amoeboid morphotype as an indicator of activation state. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling indicated divergent effects on cell signaling, metabolism, activation, and actin dynamics across confirmed compounds. In particular, multiple CNS-penetrant small molecules with prior FDA approval or demonstration of safety in vivo demonstrated modulatory effects on microglia.

        <tr id="Virus-induced senescence (VIS) is a significant biological phenomenon, which is associated with declining immune function, accelerating aging process and causing aging-related diseases. Studies have shown that a variety of common viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, herpesviruses and hepatitis B virus can cause VIS in host cells. The primary mechanisms include the abnormal activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, DNA damage response, and potential correlations with the integrated stress response due to intracellular phase separation. Viral infection and cellular senescence interact with each other: cellular senescence serves as a defense to restrict viral replication and transmission, while some viruses exploit cellular senescence to enhance their infectivity and replication. Understanding the mechanisms of VIS is conducive to the development of therapeutic strategies for viral infections and promotion of healthy aging. However, there is lack of research on therapeutic targets and drug development in this field so far; although senolytics may be effective for anti senescent cells (SCs) therapy, its efficacy for VIS need evidence provided by further clinical trials. This article reviews the research progress on the connection between viral infection and cellular senescence, to provide insights for the prevention and treatment of aging related diseases.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Immunometabolism is an emerging field of research investigating the ability of immune cells to modulate their metabolic activity for optimal function. While this has been extensively examined in peripheral immune cells like macrophages, only recently have these studies been extended to assess the immunometabolic activity of microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain.


RECENT FINDINGS
Microglia are highly metabolically flexible and can utilize different nutrients for their diverse functions. Like other immune cells, they undergo metabolic reprogramming on immune stimulation and in inflammatory, neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, researchers have looked at the intricate mechanisms that modulate microglial activity and have uncovered key links between altered metabolism, neuroinflammation, and the involvement of disease-associated risk genes.


SUMMARY
This review highlights the recent studies that have significantly contributed to our understanding of the metabolic dysregulation observed in activated microglia in conditions such as AD, unveiling novel targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection is one of the biggest public health concerns worldwide. Both pathogens are adept at modulating immune response and, in the case of Mtb, even inducing structural modification of the affected tissue. The present study aimed at understanding the early phenotypical and functional changes in immune cell infiltration in the affected organ, using a humanized mouse model. The humanized mice were infected with either HIV or Mtb in single infection, or with both pathogens in coinfection. Three weeks after the infection, lung samples were collected, and spatial transcriptomics analysis was performed. This analysis revealed high infiltration of CD4+ T cells in Mtb infection, but not in HIV or coinfection. Coinfected mice also showed a minimal number of NK cells compared to the other groups. In addition to infection status, histological features also influenced the immune cell infiltration pattern in the lungs. Two distinct airway regions with distinct immune cell abundance patterns were detected by spatial transcriptome profiling. A lymphoid cell aggregate detected in coinfection lung exhibited distinct transcript profile. The cellular architecture in the lymphoid cell aggregate did not follow the spatial patterns seen in mature granulomas. However, lymphoid cell aggregates exhibited granuloma gene expression signatures, and pathways associated with reactive oxygen species production, oxidative phosphorylation, and TGFβ and interferon signaling similar to granulomas. This study revealed specific transcription patterns, immune responses and morphological alteration signaling in the early stage of HIV and Mtb infections.">

        <tr id="Rabies virus (RABV) proteins play dual roles during the infection of complex neural tissue, the generation and spread of new virions and the active inhibition of cellular innate immune pathways, both contributing to rabies’ lethality. While spatially-distinct RABV protein residues specializing in virus-centric and immune-inhibitory functions have been identified, how these dual functions interact to shape infection outcomes across diverse types of host brain cells is unknown. To “unmask” and study how innate immune inhibition affects the transcriptional regulation of the human and viral genome with cellular resolution, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of co-cultured human brain cell types, comparing infection dynamics of a wild-type RABV isolate virus to a mutant virus in which six critical point mutations in the phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M) RABV proteins selectively neuter antagonism of interferon- and NF-κB- dependent cellular responses. Our analysis reveals that RABV gene expression is shaped by host cell type and that wild-type RABV infection induces small-scale, cell-type conserved transcriptional programs that may support infection by hijacking transcriptional feedback systems that control pro-viral host cell factors while minimizing anti-viral responses. In contrast to accepted models, disinhibited innate immune signaling increases RABV transcriptional output across infected cell types. Most strikingly, we discovered a subpopulation of astrocytes that supports an average of 6-fold higher viral mRNA expression through a massive host cell transcriptional change involving ∼38% of astrocyte expressed genes. Our analysis suggests that these astrocytes we term “pro-viral” are a rare subtype present in the human brain and are primed to play a protective role during viral infection in concert with interferon-sensitive microglia recalcitrant to infection.">

        <tr id="Peripheral neuropathy is a common and debilitating side effect of the chemotherapeutic bortezomib (BTZ). To explore the mechanisms underlying BTZ-induced neuropathy (BIPN), we developed a mouse model that replicates the route of administration and approximates the prolonged BTZ exposure experienced by patients. We find that male mice treated with BTZ experience more severe sensorimotor dysfunction and axon loss compared to females and observed similar results when analyzing human data. Using single cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal that BTZ significantly alters the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) microenvironment in mice, producing pronounced sex-specific changes in satellite glial cells (SGCs) in males and females and dysregulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly in males. These changes are accompanied by expansion of macrophages, which is more pronounced in males. We identify four macrophage subtypes in the DRG, including a pro-fibrotic population that is exclusively associated with BIPN. Depletion of macrophages via anti-CSF1R treatment in male mice prevents BTZ-induced SGC activation and aberrant collagen deposition in DRGs, potently preserves peripheral axons, and improves functional outcomes. These findings highlight SGCs, neuroinflammation and dysregulation of the ECM as drivers of sex-specific differences in BIPN and suggest that targeting neuroinflammation is a promising therapeutic strategy to treat this disease.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The Crohn’s disease-associated adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC) (strain LF82) decreases mitochondrial membrane potential and fragments the epithelial mitochondrial network. Other groups have also reported activation of NF-κB-mediated inflammation and generation of reactive oxygen species in AIEC-LF82 infected epithelia. It remains unclear how these findings integrate over the course of AIEC-LF82 infection and how they influence each other over the course of infection. Aims To characterize the sequence of events following AIEC-LF82 infection in a non-cancer derived epithelial cell model focusing on mitochondrial disruption, cell death, mtDNA release, and inflammatory gene expression. Methods The fetal derived human colon epithelial cell line (FHC) were infected with E. coli-LF82 or the commensal E. coli-HB101 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 or uninfected over the course of various experiments. FHCs were stained with SYTOX green and imaged on a CellCyte X system for 24h to measure cell death or stained with MitoTracker Deep Red and imaged on a spinning disc-confocal microscope for 16h to assess mitochondrial morphology. Also, in fixed-cell preparations mitochondrial networks were imaged by staining with anti-TOMM20 antibodies. Imaging of cytosolic DNA was performed via immunofluorescent staining of mtDNA and the mitochondrial network. As markers of inflammation, CXCL10 and IL-6 mRNA were assessed via qRT-PCR. Results Epithelia infected with E. coli-LF82 but not E. coli-HB101 displayed dramatic fragmentation of their mitochondrial network at 6h (p < 0.0001) (n=6), while SYTOX green imaging revealed significant cell death beginning at 9h (p < 0.001) (n=3). Furthermore, our preliminary data indicates that transcription of inflammatory cytokines including CXCL10, and IL-6 occurs at 8h while cytosolic escape of mtDNA occurs at 6h, after mitochondrial network disruption, but prior to cell death. Conclusions The data begins to unravel the sequence of events in a non-cancer derived epithelium after infection with E. coli-LF82, integrating mitochondrial function, inflammatory gene expression, and cell viability and providing a more fulsome understanding of the course of E. coli-LF82 infection. Together, these data advance understanding of relationship between mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death in the context of a Crohn’s disease-relevant pathobiont, AIEC-LF82.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex and multifaceted process that involves dynamic interactions among various cellular and molecular components. This sophisticated interplay supports both environmental adaptability and system resilience in the central nervous system (CNS) but may be disrupted during neuroinflammation. In this article, we first characterize the key players in neuroimmune interactions, including microglia, astrocytes, neurons, immune cells, and essential signaling molecules such as cytokines, neurotransmitters, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and neurotrophic factors. Under homeostatic conditions, these elements promote cellular cooperation and stability, whereas in neuroinflammatory states, they drive adaptive responses that may become pathological if dysregulated. We examine how neuroimmune interactions, mediated through these cellular actors and signaling pathways, create complex networks that regulate CNS functionality and respond to injury or inflammation. To further elucidate these dynamics, we provide insights using a multilayer network (MLN) approach, highlighting the interconnected nature of neuroimmune interactions under both inflammatory and homeostatic conditions. This perspective aims to enhance our understanding of neuroimmune communication and the mechanisms underlying shifts from homeostasis to neuroinflammation. Applying an MLN approach offers a more integrative view of CNS resilience and adaptability, helping to clarify inflammatory processes and identify novel intervention points within the layered landscape of neuroinflammatory responses.">

Therefore, the development of new therapeutics to treat these infections is critically needed, and immunotherapy is one potential treatment option. Immune responses against this pathogen, particularly lymphocyte- mediated responses, are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of B cells in innate resistance to A. baumannii pulmonary infection using a B cell-deficient (µMT) mouse model. B cell-deficient mice were impaired in clearing A. baumannii from the lung, liver, and spleen and failed to prevent extrapulmonary dissemination of A. baumannii after infection. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that the lack of B cells was associated with reduced expression of several genes encoding antimicrobial proteins. In addition, B cell deficiency was associated with pulmonary eosinophilia and increased pulmonary recruitment of Ly6C+ NK cells following A. baumannii infection. This study demonstrates the significant role of B cells in providing early protection against A. baumannii infection and implicates B cell-dependent mechanisms beyond antibody-mediated bacterial resistance.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection and the resultant COVID-19 pneumonia cause significant damage to the airway and lung epithelium. This damage manifests as mucus hypersecretion, pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which often lead to long-term complications collectively referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The airway epithelium, as the first line of defence against respiratory pathogens, depends on airway basal stem cells (BSCs) for regeneration. Alterations in BSCs are associated with impaired epithelial repair and may contribute to the respiratory complications observed in PASC. Given the critical role of BSCs in maintaining epithelial integrity, understanding their alterations in COVID-19 is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the intrinsic properties of BSCs derived from COVID-19 patients and evaluates the modulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Through a combination of functional assessments and transcriptomic profiling, we identified key phenotypic and molecular deviations in COVID-19 patient-derived BSCs, including goblet cell hyperplasia, inflammation and fibrosis, which may underlie their contribution to PASC. Notably, MSC co-culture significantly mitigated these adverse effects, potentially through modulation of the interferon signalling pathway. This is the first study to isolate BSCs from COVID-19 patients in the Chinese population and establish a COVID-19 BSC-based xenograft model. Our findings reveal critical insights into the role of BSCs in epithelial repair and their inflammatory alterations in COVID-19 pathology, with potential relevance to PASC and virus-induced respiratory sequelae. Additionally, our study highlights MSC-based therapies as a promising strategy to address respiratory sequelae and persistent symptoms.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Current literature widely addresses issues related to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 during pregnancy. However, the problem of dysfunction in the monocyte/macrophage system in pregnant women, particularly concerning the influence of changes in the lipid membrane microenvironment caused by SARS-CoV-2, remains unresolved. Aim. To conduct a comparative study and explore the association of lipid rafts with the expression of CD receptors on monocytes involved in forming the immune response in women who had COVID-19 during pregnancy. Materials and methods. The study included women with mild (n = 25) and moderate (n = 27) severity of COVID-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy, and 25 women not infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Using flow cytometry, lipid rafts on blood monocytes were identified by the intensity of the cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB)/ganglioside GM1 complex formation, as well as the expression of Fcγ receptor II (CD32), mannose receptor (CD206), tumor necrosis factor receptors type 1 (TNFR1) and type 2 (TNFR2), interleukin 17 receptor (IL17R), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Lipid raft microscopy was performed using a fluorescent microscope. Results. An increase in the distribution density and number of rafts in the monocyte membrane was established, which were 1.6 times higher (p < 0.001) in moderate disease severity compared to mild cases. The expression levels of CD206 increased by 1.8 times (p < 0.001), CD32 by 1.05 times (p < 0.05), TNFR1 by 1.2 times (p < 0.001), IL17R by 1.7 times (p < 0.001), and TRAIL by 1.4 times (p < 0.001) compared to mild disease. No differences in TNFR2 expression were found between subgroups (p = 0.781). A direct correlation was identified between lipid raft expression levels and CD206 (ρ = 0.70, p < 0.01), CD32 (ρ = 0.77, p < 0.01), TNFR1 (ρ = 0.63, p < 0.01), IL17R (ρ = 0.60, p < 0.01), and TRAIL (ρ = 0.70, p < 0.01). An inverse correlation was also established between the gestational age at delivery and the expression of rafts (ρ = -0.53, p < 0.01), CD206 (ρ = -0.36, p = 0.008), and CD32 (ρ = -0.32, p = 0.02). However, the gestational age at the time of illness was not associated with changes in the expression of lipid rafts and CD receptors. Conclusion. In women who had COVID-19 during the third trimester of pregnancy, monocytes predominantly exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype expressing increased amounts of pre-activation markers CD206 and CD32, as well as cytokine receptors TNFR1, IL17R, and TRAIL. It can be hypothesized that the increased expression of CD206, CD32, and IL17R—which directly correlated with the number of lipid rafts—may be directly related to monocyte activation and, thus, to the severity of the infection and the development of complications during pregnancy.">

The resolution phase of neutrophilic inflammation is critical to preventing tissue damage, as observed in diseases characterized by influx of neutrophils such as atherosclerosis and non-healing wounds. Animal models have provided insight into resolution of neutrophilic inflammation via efferocytosis and reverse migration (rM); however, species-specific differences and complexity of innate immune responses make translation to humans challenging. Thus, there is a need for in vitro systems that can elucidate mechanisms of resolution of human neutrophilic inflammation. Here, we developed a human microphysiological system (MPS) to mimic an inflammatory sterile injury (SI) microenvironment to study the role of macrophage derived extracellular vesicles (M-EVs) in determining the resolution of inflammation via neutrophil rM. The MPS integrates a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) lined lumen, injury site spheroid, human neutrophils, macrophages and macrophage derived EVs to investigate the role of M-EVs in neutrophil rM in vitro. The key features of the MPS enabled us to demonstrate that EVs derived from macrophage subsets modulate migratory behavior in primary neutrophils differently in specific inflammatory microenvironments. Importantly, we identified a new mechanism underlying neutrophil rM via M-EV, where neutrophils exposed to M2-EV-derived IL-8 migrate away from the SI site upon reaching the site, using the SI MPS. Overall, our SI MPS system demonstrates a reverse migratory pattern in human primary neutrophils, advancing the study of the resolution of inflammation via M-EVs.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcus aureus prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are broadly considered incurable, and clinical diagnostics that guide conservative vs. aggressive surgical treatments don’t exist. Multi-omics studies in a humanized NSG-SGM3 BLT mouse model demonstrate human T cells: 1) are remarkably heterogenous in gene expression and numbers, and 2) exist as a mixed population of activated, progenitor-exhausted, and terminally-exhausted Th1/Th17 cells with increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (LAG3, TIM-3). Importantly, these proteins are upregulated in the serum and the bone marrow of S. aureus PJI patients. A multiparametric nomogram combining high serum immune checkpoint protein levels with low proinflammatory cytokine levels (IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-17) revealed that TIM-3 was highly predictive of adverse disease outcomes (AUC=0.89). Hence, T cell impairment in the form of immune checkpoint expression and exhaustion could be a functional biomarker for S. aureus PJI disease outcome, and blockade of checkpoint proteins could potentially improve outcomes following surgery.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), involves symptoms or effects that persist for more than 4 weeks after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. One contributing factor to this condition is the disruption in the expression of the antioxidant enzyme Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2 (Nrf2) induced by the COVID-19 infection. Apigenin and related flavonoids, known for their diverse pharmacological activities, including potent antioxidant properties, have emerged as promising candidates for Long COVID-19 therapy. These compounds, particularly apigenin, are recognized for their ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation, making them potential activators of the Nrf2 pathway. This study aims to predict the activity of apigenin and its related flavonoids as Nrf2 activators using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) techniques, providing insights into their therapeutic potential in managing Long COVID-19. The findings from the molecular modeling analysis indicate that apigenin has a favorable affinity, with a free energy value (ΔG) of −6.40 kcal/mol. Additionally, MD simulation results demonstrate the strong stability of the Keap1-apigenin complex, with an average Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) value below 0.20 nm and the lowest average Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) value of 0.86 nm. Using the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) calculation method, the binding affinity of the Keap1-apigenin complex yields a lower free energy value (ΔG) of −67.039 kJ/mol, consistent with the molecular modeling results. Apigenin also exhibits the ability to inhibit the binding of Nrf2 to the hydrophobic surface of Keap1, with a total energy value of 993.266 kcal/mol and binding affinity value of −1.162 kJ/mol through peptide−receptor docking. In conclusion, the comprehensive results suggest that apigenin has the potential to be a lead compound for developing Nrf2 activators specifically designed for Long COVID-19 therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Molecules of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) are key players in immune regulation; an increase in some TNFSF molecules has been reported during severe COVID‐19. In this study, we profiled and evaluated TNFSF members in the serum of COVID‐19 vaccine‐naïve patients to identify potential biomarkers associated with disease severity. Our data show that TRAIL serum levels are lower in severely affected patients than those mildly affected by COVID‐19 (AUC 0.8, p = 0.0003). On the contrary, OPG and BAFF serum levels are higher in severe COVID‐19 compared to mild COVID‐19 cases (AUC 0.8, p = 0.0001; AUC 0.7, p = 0.0012; respectively) and moderate COVID‐19 cases (OPG p < 0.01), BAFF (p < 0.05). At the transcriptional level, TRAIL, OPG and BAFF are elevated in severe compared to mild COVID‐19 cases, with OPG and BAFF also higher in moderate compared to mild COVID‐19 patients. Additionally, we found that APRIL, LIGHT, CD30L and CD40L protein‐levels are higher in COVID‐19 patients compared to healthy donors but not significantly different between various COVID‐19 clinical statuses. Finally, we found that TNF‐α, TNF‐β, RANKL and TWEAK protein levels were not affected during COVID‐19. Our work identifies OPG and BAFF as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for preventing severe COVID‐19. Due to the opposite contradictory levels of TRAIL (protein/transcriptional level), its role during COVID‐19 should be elucidated and clarified with more in‐depth studies.">

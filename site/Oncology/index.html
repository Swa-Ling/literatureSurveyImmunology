        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T-cells are essential for controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet their antigen-specific resolution in relation to disease severity, functional dynamics during acute infection, and long-term memory formation remain incompletely understood. Using comprehensive longitudinal profiling of 553 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic antigens across globally prevalent HLAs, we identified antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses that were either critical for early viral clearance or associated with severe disease outcomes. During acute infection, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a broader and more robust CD8+ T-cell response than those with mild disease. Notably, we identified HLA-A1-restricted immunodominant antigen-specific T-cells strongly associated with severe disease. These T-cells were present at extremely high frequencies but showed significantly reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules at both the transcriptomic (PRF1, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY) and protein levels (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2), as revealed by multidimensional single-cell and cytokine profiling. In contrast, patients with mild disease had T-cells that recognized a more restricted set of antigens, showed only partial overlap with those in severe cases, and showed enhanced cytotoxicity, along with enrichment in gene sets associated with cytotoxic function, hypoxia, and glycolysis. Furthermore, the long-term memory CD8+ T-cells were maintained for a limited subset of immunodominant antigens, with their persistence correlating with their initial frequency during infection. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following infection expanded the long-term T-cell repertoire by enhancing pre-existing responses and generating de novo responses, regardless of prior disease severity. These findings resolve the antigen-specific kinetics and durability of CD8+ T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide key insights into their functional landscape. This knowledge could inform future vaccine strategies and therapeutic interventions to enhance protective immunity against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is a heterogeneous clinical condition of uncertain etiology triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we used ultrasensitive approaches to profile the immune system and the plasma proteome in healthy convalescent individuals and individuals with long COVID, spanning geographically independent cohorts from Sweden and the United Kingdom. Symptomatic disease was not consistently associated with quantitative differences in immune cell lineage composition or antiviral T cell immunity. Healthy convalescent individuals nonetheless exhibited higher titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 than individuals with long COVID, and extensive phenotypic analyses revealed a subtle increase in the expression of some co-inhibitory receptors, most notably PD-1 and TIM-3, among SARS-CoV-2 nonspike-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with long COVID. We further identified a shared plasma biomarker signature of disease linking breathlessness with apoptotic inflammatory networks centered on various proteins, including CCL3, CD40, IKBKG, IL-18 and IRAK1, and dysregulated pathways associated with cell cycle progression, lung injury and platelet activation, which could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of long COVID.">

        <tr id="Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was repurposed to treat COVID-19 based on its in vitro antiviral effects. However, it was abandoned after multiple clinical trials reported a lack of efficacy. Immunomodulatory effects have been proposed but remain unclear, yet they may be relevant given IVM use for other infections. We assessed the IVM immunomodulatory effect in 24 participants from a clinical trial evaluating its potential to reduce COVID-19 transmission in mild cases within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM-treated patients showed non-significant lower viral loads, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We measured IgG, IgA, and IgM against five SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and 30 cytokines by Luminex, alongside whole blood RNA sequencing, pan-leukocyte immunophenotyping, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell analysis by flow cytometry from day 1 to day 28 post-treatment. All antibody responses increased from day 4, while 13 cytokines significantly decreased over time (adjusted p<0.05). IVM-treated patients had only significantly higher anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels at day 4 (adjusted p=0.041) and 7 (adjusted p=0.045) compared to placebo. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased over time, with significantly higher effector memory CD4+ T cells at day 7 compared to day 1 (p=0.027) and the only difference between groups was lower frequencies of spike-specific naïve CD4+ T cells at day 7 in IVM-treated participants (0.006% vs 0.036% p=0.02). Transcriptomic data showed downregulation of innate and antiviral blood transcriptional modules (BTMs) over time, with an increase in adaptive immune related BTMs. While no differential gene expression was detected, the IVM-treated had upregulated innate and downregulated T cell and cell cycle BTMs compared to placebo. Overall, our comprehensive longitudinal analysis of early immune responses in mild COVID-19 revealed no robust immunological effects of IVM, consistent with clinical trials results and suggesting a lack of efficacy of IVM in COVID-19 treatment. AUTHOR SUMMARY Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was tested in clinical trials as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due to its in vitro antiviral properties and hypothetical immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory effects of IVM in a clinical trial involving 24 mild COVID-19 patients who received IVM within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM group showed a trend towards lower viral loads post-treatment, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We comprehensively analyzed immune responses by measuring antibody levels, cytokine profiles, immune cell subsets and whole blood gene expression over 28 days. The IVM group only had increased levels of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid compared to the control group. IVM did not affect the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 T cells, despite a slight decrease in naive CD4+ T cells. Additionally, gene expression analysis showed a decrease in innate and antiviral responses and an increase of adaptive responses over time that were slightly stronger in the placebo compared to the IVM group. In conclusion, despite some differences in IVM treated participants, our detailed analyses do not support significant immunomodulatory effects that could benefit disease progression.">

In addition, we resampled a subset of these patients for transcriptome analyses at 3 (n = 7) and 12 months (n = 5) post infection and followed the expression of differentially regulated genes over time. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed 3112 differentially methylated regions between COVID-19 patients and controls. Hypomethylated regions affected immune regulatory genes, while hypermethylated regions were associated with genes governing ciliary function. These genes were not only downregulated in the acute phase of the disease but sustained repressed up to 12 months post infection in ciliated cells. Validation in an independent cohort collected 6 months post infection (n  = 15) indicated symptom-dependent transcriptional repression of ciliary genes. We therefore propose that hypermethylation observed in the acute phase may exert a long-term effect on gene expression, possibly contributing to post-acute COVID-19 sequelae.">

        <tr id="Background : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains a public health challenge worldwide. The gastrointestinal tract has emerged as an important site of infection and has been implicated as a reservoir for long-term infection, particularly for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. However, whether vaccine-induced systemic antibodies can prevent intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Compared to Vero cells commonly used to assess SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, the intestinal epithelium has a functional interferon response and expresses higher levels of ACE2, enzymes, and antibody-binding Fc receptors that may impact SARS-CoV-2 immune elimination. Methods : We evaluated the potential of antibodies from both naturally infected and vaccinated human subjects to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of the intestinal epithelium. Serum samples were collected from human volunteers who had undergone natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 (n=5) or who had received the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (n=13). Banked sera collected in 2016 served as negative controls (n=2). SARS-CoV-2 (WA01, Delta or Omicron) was pre-treated with sera and then used to infect iPSC-derived human intestinal organoids (HIO) or Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was quantified by plaque assay, PCR, or immunofluorescence (IF) after 48-96 h. Results: Both HIOs and Caco-2 cells supported robust infection with SARS-CoV-2. In HIOs, pretreatment of SARS-CoV-2 with a high titer post-vaccine serum completely blocked replication of WA01. Similarly, sera from both naturally infected donors collected in 2020 and sera from individuals who had received a BNT162b2 vaccine significantly inhibited replication of the WA01 strain in Caco-2 cells. In contrast, none of the sera significantly inhibited infection with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. For Omicron, only sera from individuals who had received an Omicron-based vaccine significantly inhibited infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the plaque assay. Across all virus types, sera from individuals who had received Omicron-based BNT162b2 boosters were the most effective at reducing infection in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that vaccine-induced antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective in the gut. Our study also supports previous reports indicating that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines need to be adapted to circulating virus strains to convey full protection from infection.">

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak revealed the susceptibility of elderly patients to respiratory virus infections, showing cell senescence or subclinical persistent inflammatory profiles and favoring the development of severe pneumonia. Methods In our study, we evaluated the potential influence of lung aging on the efficiency of replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as determining the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of the distal lung tissue. Results Using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from donors of different ages, we found that pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 IAV replicated in the lung parenchyma with high efficacy. In contrast to these IAV strains, SARS-CoV-2 Early isolate and Delta variant of concern (VOC) replicated less efficiently in PCLS. Interestingly, both viruses showed reduced replication in PCLS from older compared to younger donors, suggesting that aged lung tissue represents a suboptimal environment for viral replication. Regardless of the age-dependent viral loads, PCLS responded to H5N1 IAV infection by an induction of IL-6 and IP10/CXCL10, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and to H1N1 IAV infection by induction of IP10/CXCL10 mRNA. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 IAV infection were not causing detectable cell death, H5N1 IAV infection led to more cytotoxicity and induced significant early interferon responses. Conclusions In summary, our findings suggest that aged lung tissue might not favor viral dissemination, pointing to a determinant role of dysregulated immune mechanisms in the development of severe disease.

        <tr id="Viral encephalitis, resulting from neurotropic viral infections, leads to severe neurological impairment, inflammation, and exhibits high mortality rates with poor prognosis. Currently, there is a lack of effective targeted treatments for this disease, which poses a significant public health concern. SARM1 has been identified as the pivotal mediator of axonal degeneration and inflammation across various neuropathies, activated by an elevation in the NMN/NAD+ ratio. However, comprehensive in vivo investigations into the role of SARM1-mediated pathogenesis in viral encephalitis are still lacking. In this study, we established mouse models of viral encephalitis using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and rabies virus (RABV) as representative pathogens. Our findings demonstrate that neurotropic virus infections elicit robust axonal degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, and profound neuropathological damage in cortical neurons via the activation of SARM1. In mouse models of viral encephalitis, deletion or inhibition of SARM1 effectively preserved axonal morphology and maintained mitochondrial homeostasis, while also attenuating the infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes in the cortex. Consequently, these interventions ameliorated neuropathological damage and enhanced survival outcomes in mice. Our findings suggest that SARM1-mediated axonal degeneration and brain inflammation exacerbate the pathological progression of viral encephalitis. Therapies targeting SARM1 emerge as viable and promising strategies for protecting neuronal function in the context of neurotropic viral infections.

        <tr id="Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. ZF2001, a protein subunit vaccine targeting the RBD, was utilized to evaluate its impact on the immune system of COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to investigate peripheral cell profiles one year after three doses of ZF2001 vaccine using single cell mass spectrometry flow cytometry (CyTOF), a technique that allows detailed characterization of the immune response against SARS-COV-2 infection and further evaluation of ZF2001 mechanisms as a prophylactic against chronic disease and reducing mortality. Methods: This study profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 16 vaccinated COVID-19 patients (Omicron 5.2) and 8 hDs using CyTOF with a 41-antibody panel. PBMCs isolated via Lymphoprep density gradient underwent metal-tagged antibody staining. Data analysis included FlowJo gating, Seurat/Harmony batch correction, PhenoGraph clustering (k=45), and t-SNE visualization. Statistical assessments employed Wilcoxon tests and Spearman correlation. Results: Our findings revealed significant differences between infected and healthy individuals one year after three doses of ZF2001. Specifically, infected individuals exhibited: significant elevation of cytotoxic T cells expressing CD8 with a proliferation marker antigen-Kiel 67 (Ki67) and an adhesion molecule (CD138), expansion of B cells and reduction of monocytes expressing CD16, as well as depletion of CD4+ T cells and differentiation of T cells 1 year after the vaccine. These changes suggested that the vaccine was effectively modulating the immune response. Discussion: Our results provided a detailed single-cell profile of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated patients, highlighting significant changes in immune cell kinetics indicative of an active innate and adaptive immune cell response.">

        <tr id="With the continuous emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, long-lasting and broadly reactive cellular and humoral immunity is critical for durable protection from COVID-19. We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in relation to antibodies, infection outcome and disease severity and assessed its durability in a longitudinal cohort over a three-year time course. We identified pre-existing T cells reactive to the seasonal coronavirus (CoV) OC43 that cross-react with the conserved SARS-CoV-2 spike S813-829 peptide. These cross-reactive T cells increased in frequency following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and correlated with enhanced spike-specific T cell responses and significantly reduced viral loads. Furthermore, our data revealed that CoV-cross-reactive T cells were maintained as part of the long-lasting memory response, contributing to increased T cell frequencies against omicron variants. These findings suggest a functional role of CoV-cross-reactive T cells that extends beyond the initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, contributing to enhanced immunity against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, can cause neurological symptoms, but the underlying neurotropic mechanisms are unclear. Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.258.17, B.1.1.7, and BA.5.3.2 (termed wild-type, alpha and omicron, respectively) revealed that human astrocytes, not neurons, support viral proliferation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics. In summary, human astrocytes, but not neurons, contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, highlighting the potential benefits of ketamine treatment in coronavirus infections.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids.

        <tr id="Viral replication in endothelial cells is a hallmark of many viral diseases in humans and other animals, underscoring the importance of understanding cellular mechanisms that restrict viral replication and the associated consequences for vascular health. Pathogenic variants of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV, Isavirus salaris) target endothelial cells of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), causing severe systemic disease and major losses during outbreaks in aquaculture. To better understand the endothelial response to ISAV, we used single nucleus RNA-sequencing at pre-clinical (12 days post infection, dpi) and clinical (16 dpi) stages of infection. Our approach enables an assessment of transcriptomic responses for different endothelial subpopulations at unprecedented resolution. ISAV RNA was predominantly detected in endothelial cells, which, along with mononuclear phagocytes, showed the highest number of differentially regulated genes at both time points. At 12 dpi, differentially expressed genes in endothelial cells were enriched for pathways related to NOD-like receptor signaling, antiviral responses, and regulation of programmed cell death. By 16 dpi, we observed a shift toward enrichment of pathways associated with cellular senescence, apelin signaling, and insulin signaling. We identified two distinct infection-related states at both time points: a virus-permissive state characterized by upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, small GTPase signaling, and MAPK activity, and a bystander phenotype marked by activation of antiviral responses, immune signaling, and translational regulation. This study is the first to capture the individual cell type responses to ISAV infection, and to characterize the in vivo endothelial response to active viral replication at single-cell resolution in any species.">

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is characterized by cytokine storm and organ dysfunction. The spike S1 subunit induces inflammatory cytokine production, but the immune cell subsets that respond to S1 stimulation and contribute to disease severity remain unclear. Methods We analyzed serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 (moderate: n = 7; severe: n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 38). Using mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight; CyTOF), we analyzed immune cell responses to S1 subunit stimulation in PBMCs from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19. We examined correlations among identified cell populations, serum cytokine levels, and clinical parameters. Results Serum S1 subunit levels correlated with disease severity and inflammatory cytokine concentrations. S1 subunit stimulation induced dose-dependent cytokine production from PBMCs, predominantly from myeloid cells. CyTOF analysis identified classical monocytes with high CD147 expression (CD147hi cMono) as the primary source of S1-induced cytokines. The proportion of CD147hi cMono increased significantly in severe COVID-19 and decreased with clinical improvement.

        <tr id="The appearance of diabetes-associated autoantibodies is the first detectable sign of the disease process leading to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Evidence suggests that T1D is a heterogenous disease, where the type of antibodies first formed imply subtypes. Here, we followed 49 children, who subsequently presented with T1D and 49 matched controls, profiling single-cell epigenomics at different time points of disease development. Quantitation of cell and nuclei populations as well as transcriptome and open-chromatin states indicated robust, early, replicable monocyte lineage differences between cases and controls, suggesting heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion early among cases. The order of autoantibody emergence in cases showed variation across lymphoid and myeloid cells, potentially indicating cellular immune response divergence. The strong monocytic lineage representation in peripheral blood immune cells before seroconversion and the weaker differential coordination of these gene networks close to clinical diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early life as a critical phase in T1D development.">

        <tr id="Interactions between the brain and immune system play a key role in the aetiology of brain disorders, with inflammation emerging as a potential causal factor in subsets of major depressive disorder, particularly those resistant to treatment. The causal mechanisms through which immune activation can drive depressive symptoms remain elusive, limiting the ability to develop new targeted therapies. Using a mouse model of neuroinflammation, involving a TLR7/8 agonist, we found central and systemic inflammation alongside anhedonia-like behaviours, altered thalamostriatal signalling and infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain. Here, we sought to use combined whole-brain transcriptome and spatial transcriptomics approaches to determine whether Aldara-driven neuroinflammation resulted in consistent immune and neurobiological changes throughout the brain. We found evidence of strong immune activation throughout the brain, with astrocytes displaying a strong inflammatory profile that was relatively uniform throughout. However, we found that this global inflammatory signal led to regionally-specific changes in gene expression, particularly reduced expression of genes associated with synaptic function in brain areas underlying mood and anxiety, such as ventral striatum and amygdala. Our data suggest potential mechanisms through which astrocytes regulate neuronal function in response to inflammation.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, including prolonged viral shedding and emergence of mutations. To investigate the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, seven SIV+ rhesus macaques were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 in all macaques was mild. SARS-CoV-2 replication persisted in the upper, but not the lower respiratory tract for 14 days post-infection. Animals showed impaired generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cells. Animals also displayed transient changes in microbial communities in the upper airway and gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 evolution was observed in the upper respiratory tract. This study demonstrates that SIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in rhesus macaques recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in PLWH. We show that SIV impairs anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, potentially leading to prolonged viral shedding, altered pathogenesis, and viral evolution. This highlights the importance of HIV status in COVID-19 and supports the use of this model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global health challenge. Severe cases often respond poorly to standard treatments, highlighting the necessity for novel therapeutic targets and early predictive biomarkers. Methods We utilized flow cytometry to analyze peripheral immune cells from healthy, bacterial pneumonia patients, and COVID-19 patients. The expansion of activated T cells (CD38+HLA-DR+), monocytes, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were detected and correlated with clinical outcomes to evaluate prognostic potential. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was applied to characterize the critical cell subset associated with prognosis and elucidate its phenotype in COVID-19. Results We revealed a significant increase in CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells in non-survivor COVID-19 patients, establishing them as an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality. The scRNA-seq analysis identified the CD38+HLA-DR+ T cell as a terminally differentiated, Treg-like subset exhibiting both activation and exhaustion characteristics. This subset presented the highest IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels among all T-cell subsets. Further functional analysis demonstrated its enhanced major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) cross-signaling and correspondingly enriched cytoskeletal rearrangement processes. In addition, there was dysregulated NAD+ metabolism in CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells via scRNA-seq, accompanied by elevated adenosine and decreased NAD+ levels in serums from COVID-19 patients. Conclusions We identified the selective expansion of CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells as a novel prognostic indicator for COVID-19 outcomes. These cells’ unique activated-exhausted phenotype, along with their impact on NAD+ metabolism, provides new insights into COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT JC Polyomavirus is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often-fatal demyelinating disease. Unfortunately, a diagnosis of PML occurs only after patients have suffered irreversible neuropathologies. The first step in the initiation of PML is viral entry to the brain, but the route and mechanisms responsible for neuroinvasion have not been well established. To gain a better understanding of this, we asked whether purified virus or virus associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) could penetrate two different cell culture models of the blood-brain barrier. In one model, we used the hCMEC/D3 brain endothelial cell line, and in the other, we used pluripotent stem cells induced to a brain endothelial cell phenotype (iPSC-EC). We found that neither cell type was permissive to viral infection, but the virus bound and was internalized by both in a sialic acid-dependent manner. Despite virus internalization into these cells, very few virions or virus-associated extracellular vesicles (virus-EVs) penetrated the barriers. The small amount of virus or virus-EVs that did pass through either barrier was sufficient to establish infection in human glial cells. Our findings demonstrate that limited amounts of infectious virions and virus-associated EVs can traverse the brain microvascular endothelium and establish infection. IMPORTANCE The human polyomavirus, JC Polyomavirus (JCPyV), causes a rapidly progressing demyelinating disease in immunocompromised or immunomodulated patients. Demyelinating lesions are often seen surrounding blood vessels in the brain. In this paper, we used two models to recapitulate a minimal blood-brain barrier and found that both were highly restrictive of virus penetration. A small amount of virus succeeded in crossing both barriers and was sufficient to establish infection of human glia. These data have direct implications for mechanisms used by JCPyV to invade the CNS and cause neurological disease.

        <tr id="The catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine is classically known for regulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions such as reward, movement, and cognition. Increasing evidence also indicates that dopamine regulates critical functions in peripheral organs and is an important immunoregulatory factor. We have previously shown that dopamine increases NF-κB activity, inflammasome activation, and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β in human macrophages. As myeloid lineage cells are central to the initiation and resolution of acute inflammatory responses, dopamine-mediated dysregulation of these functions could both impair the innate immune response and exacerbate chronic inflammation. However, the exact pathways by which dopamine drives myeloid inflammation are not well defined, and studies in both rodent and human systems indicate that dopamine can impact the production of inflammatory mediators through both D1-like dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD5) and D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4). Therefore, we hypothesized that dopamine-mediated production of IL-1β in myeloid cells is regulated by the ratio of different dopamine receptors that are activated. Our data in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) indicate that DRD1 expression is necessary for dopamine-mediated increases in IL-1β, and that changes in the expression of DRD2 and other dopamine receptors can alter the magnitude of the dopamine-mediated increase in IL-1β. Mature hMDM have a high D1-like to D2-like receptor ratio, which is different relative to monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We further confirm in human microglia cell lines that a high ratio of D1-like to D2-like receptors promotes dopamine-induced increases in IL-1β gene and protein expression using pharmacological inhibition or overexpression of dopamine receptors. RNA-sequencing of dopamine-treated microglia shows that genes encoding functions in IL-1β signaling pathways, microglia activation, and neurotransmission increased with dopamine treatment. Finally, using HIV as an example of a chronic inflammatory disease that is substantively worsened by comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs) that impact dopaminergic signaling, we show increased effects of dopamine on inflammasome activation and IL-1β in the presence of HIV in both human macrophages and microglia. These data suggest that use of addictive substances and dopamine-modulating therapeutics could dysregulate the innate inflammatory response and exacerbate chronic neuroimmunological conditions like HIV. Thus, a detailed understanding of dopamine-mediated changes in inflammation, in particular pathways regulating IL-1β, will be critical to effectively tailor medication regimens.

We reveal a link between sCD13 and amplified neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. sCD13 was markedly elevated in COVID-19 patients and correlated with disease severity, variants, ethnicity, inflammation markers, and NETosis. Neutrophils treated with sCD13 showed heightened NETosis and chemotaxis which were inhibited by sCD13 receptor blockade. Meanwhile sCD13 did not induce platelet aggregation. Single-cell analysis of COVID-19 lungs revealed co-expression of CD13 and MMP14 by various cell types, and higher CD13 expression compared to controls. Neutrophils with high CD13 mRNA were enriched for genes associated with immaturity, though CD13 protein expression was lower. Histological examination of COVID-19 lungs revealed CD13-positive leukocytes trapped in vessels with fibrin thrombi. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of B1R and a second sCD13 receptor, protease-activated receptor 4, on monocytes and neutrophils. These findings identify sCD13 as a potential instigator of COVID-19-associated NETosis, potentiating vascular stress and thromboembolic complications.

        <tr id="The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression in the brain is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Beyond their conventional role in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, certain miRNAs can act extracellularly as signaling molecules. Our study elucidates the identity of such miRNA species serving as ligands for membrane receptors expressed in central nervous system (CNS) neurons and the impact of such miRNAs on neurons in the context of neurodegenerative disease. Methods We combined a machine learning approach with the analysis of disease-associated miRNA databases to predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated miRNAs as potential signaling molecules for single-stranded RNA-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8. TLR-expressing HEK-Blue reporter cells, primary murine microglia, and human THP-1 macrophages were used to validate the AD miRNAs as ligands for human and mouse TLR7 and/or TLR8. Interaction between mouse cortical neurons and extracellularly applied AD miRNAs was analyzed by live cell imaging and confocal microscopy. Transcriptome changes in cortical neurons exposed to AD miRNAs were assessed by RNAseq and RT-qPCR. The extracellular AD miRNAs’ effects on CNS neuron structure were investigated in cell cultures of murine primary cortical neurons and iPSC-derived human cortical neurons by immunocytochemistry. We employed a mouse model of intrathecal injection to assess effects of AD miRNAs acting as signaling molecules on neurons in vivo. Results We identified the AD-associated miRNAs miR-124-5p, miR-92a-1-5p, miR-9-5p, and miR-501-3p as novel endogenous ligands for TLR7 and/or TLR8. These miRNAs being extracellularly stable and active were taken up by murine cortical neurons via endocytosis and induced changes in neuronal inflammation-, proliferation-, and apoptosis-related gene expression. Exposure of both murine and human cortical neurons to the AD-associated miRNAs led to alterations of dendrite and axon structure, synapse protein expression, and cell viability in a sequence-dependent fashion. Extracellular introduction of the AD miRNAs into the cerebrospinal fluid of mice resulted in both changes in neuronal structure and synapses, and neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex. Most of the observed extracellular miRNA-induced effects on cortical neurons involved TLR7/8 signaling. Conclusion Neurodegenerative disease-associated miRNAs in extracellular form act as signaling molecules for CNS neurons including human cortical neurons, thereby modulating their structure and viability.

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells remains very limited. The contributions of intracellular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also unclear. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for IGFBP2, specifically in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2), in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we show that IGFBP2 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in primary AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions from patients with COVID-19-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alone or IPF with a history of COVID-19. Using multicolor immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 and its selective ligands IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly reduced in AEC2 cells from patients with COVID-ARDS, IPF alone, or IPF with COVID history than in those from age-matched donor controls. Further, we demonstrated that lentiviral expression of Igfbp2 significantly reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines—Tnf-α, Il1β, Il6, Stat3, Stat6 and chemokine receptors—Ccr2 and Ccr5—in mouse lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injury (S2; 500 ng/mL). Finally, we demonstrated higher levels of cytokines—TNF-α; IL-6 and chemokine receptor—CCR5 in AEC2 cells from COVID-ARDS patients compared to the IPF alone and the IPF with COVID history patients. Altogether, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IGFBP2 in AEC2 cells and its localized delivery may serve as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with COVID-19.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and resulting coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) cause placental dysfunction, which increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. While abnormal placental pathology resulting from COVID‐19 is common, direct infection of the placenta is rare. This suggests that pathophysiology associated with maternal COVID‐19, rather than direct placental infection, is responsible for placental dysfunction. We hypothesized that maternal circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), altered by COVID‐19 during pregnancy, contribute to placental dysfunction. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized circulating EVs from pregnancies complicated by COVID‐19 and tested their effects on trophoblast cell physiology in vitro. Trophoblast exposure to EVs isolated from patients with an active infection (AI), but not controls, altered key trophoblast functions including hormone production and invasion. Thus, circulating EVs from participants with an AI, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, can disrupt vital trophoblast functions. EV cargo differed between participants with COVID‐19, depending on the gestational timing of infection, and Controls, which may contribute to the disruption of the placental transcriptome and morphology. Our findings show that COVID‐19 can have effects throughout pregnancy on circulating EVs, and circulating EVs are likely to participate in placental dysfunction induced by COVID‐19.">

The immune system plays an important role in establishing and maintaining successful pregnancy, yet deep understanding of immunological responses in pregnancy is lacking. To provide in-depth understanding of the immunological landscape of pregnancy, with a focus on NK cells, we used high-throughput cell surface proteome screening of >350 markers and scRNAseq with 130 CITE-seq antibodies to identify key differentially expressed molecules and investigated their potential roles in altered immunity. We identified skewing in NK cell subsets towards higher frequencies of CD56bright cells caused by a reduced number of CD56dim cells in the peripheral blood during pregnancy and provide evidence for a role of chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, in NK cell activation. In addition, we defined a new cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced decidual NK cell population in CMV+ pregnancies with tissue-residency markers. Overall, our data provide fundamental knowledge into how NK cell immunity is altered in pregnancy, and key knowledge needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic strategies to manage infections or pregnancy complications.">

        <tr id="Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a severe complication of sepsis, affecting approximately 70% of patients, leading to increased mortality and long-term cognitive impairments among survivors. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on the development of SAE, especially related to the cellular communication networks in the brain microenvironment. Methods: We evaluated the impact of myeloid cells on the brain's immune microenvironment through glial cell alterations using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data from human and mouse models and validated this with correlative experiments. We also developed the DeconvCellLink R package to study neuroinflammation-associated cellular interaction networks. A dynamic brain immune microenvironment map showing temporal alterations in brain cellular network during systemic inflammatory reactions was constructed using time-series data. Results: While brain cellular alterations differed between human and animal models, a highly conserved set of sepsis-associated genes regulating immune microenvironment signalling was identified. The dynamic alterations in cellular interaction networks and cytokines revealed brain immune cells' temporal response to systemic inflammation. We also found that valproic acid could mitigate sepsis-induced neuroinflammation by regulating glial cell balance and modulating the neuroimmune microenvironment. Conclusion: Through dynamic cellular communication networks, the study revealed that, immune dysregulation in the inflamed brain in SAE involves overactivation of innate immunity, with neutrophils playing a crucial role, providing a scientific framework for developing novel therapeutic strategies and offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced brain dysfunction.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths globally; however, the characterization of molecular biomarkers of severe disease remains of great scientific importance. The aim of this study was to capture the transcriptional differences of the whole blood gene expression between COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease, using Next Generation Sequencing technologies, on admission and after 7 days. The genes which were differentially expressed in severe compared to mild patients were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Gene expression data were used to estimate the cell abundance of 22 immune cell types via digital cytometry. GO terms related to the response to molecules of bacterial origin, such as intestine-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were enriched, among other dysregulated pathways, which are well described as paramount mechanisms of severe manifestations of COVID-19. The neutrophil population increased in patients with severe disease, whereas the monocyte, CD8+ T cell, and activated Natural Killer (NK) cell populations were depleted. These cell population dynamics are also indicative of severe COVID-19 and intestinal bacterial translocation. This study elucidates the molecular basis of severe COVID-19 and highlights intestinal bacterial translocation as a potential driver of severe disease.">

        <tr id="Background Pregnant women are considered a high-risk population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as the virus can infect the placenta and embryos. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been widely reported to cause retinal pathological changes and to infect the embryonic retina. The infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is primarily mediated through spike (S) protein, which also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, it remains poorly understood how the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 affects retinal development, and the underlying mechanism has not yet been clarified. Methods We used human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids (hEROs) as a model to study the effect of S protein exposure at different stages of retinal development. hEROs were treated with 2 μg/mL of S protein on days 90 and 280. Immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR were performed to assess the influence of S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages. Results The results showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the receptors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, were expressed in hEROs. Exposure to the S protein induced an inflammatory response in both the early and late stages of retinal development in the hEROs. Additionally, RNA sequencing indicated that early exposure of the S protein to hEROs affected nuclear components and lipid metabolism, while late-stages exposure resulted in changes to cell membrane components and the extracellular matrix. Conclusion This work highlights the differential effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced developmental impairments in the human retina.

        <tr id="Background Evobrutinib, a third-generation Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, shows great promise for treating neuroinflammatory diseases due to its small molecular size, ease of absorption, and ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Although previous studies have confirmed significant BTK expression in microglia, the potential of Evobrutinib to treat ischemic stroke by modulating microglial function and its underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Methods Male C57BL/6 mice with cerebral ischemia was established to evaluate the effects of oral Evobrutinib treatment. Assessments included TTC staining, behavioral experiments, and pathological examinations were used to evaluate cerebral ischemic injury. Western Blot, flow cytometry, and qPCR were employed to monitor changes in BTK and pBTK expression in microglia and the impact of Evobrutinib on neuroinflammation following the stroke. In vitro, primary microglia were generated to determine the effects of Evobrutinib on the TLR4/ Myd88/NF-κB pathway and on the polarization of microglial subtypes. Results The expression of BTK and pBTK is upregulated in microglia under conditions of cerebral ischemia and oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). Evobrutinib treatment not only reduced infarct volume in mice but also ameliorated pathological damage and facilitated neurological function recovery. Flow cytometry revealed that Evobrutinib decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and promoted M2 microglia polarization post-stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that Evobrutinib downregulated the proportion of pro-inflammatory microglia and curtailed the secretion of inflammatory factors under OGD conditions. Mechanistically, Evobrutinib attenuated the OGD-induced upregulation of TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB expression, an effect that was further enhanced by the addition of the TLR4 pathway inhibitor TAK242. Conclusions Evobrutinib inhibits the expression and activation of BTK in microglia, reducing M1 microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and alleviating ischemic injury following stroke. This effect is mechanistically linked to the inhibition of TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB-mediated M1 polarization of microglia.

        <tr id="Background Despite the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in reducing mortality and severe cases of COVID-19, a proportion of survivors experience long-term symptoms, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). This study investigates the long-term immunological and neurodegenerative effects associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) in COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods 13 Controls and 20 COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, were recruited. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in both plasma and EVs. A deep-immunophenotyping of monocytes, T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) was performed, along with immunostainings of SARS-CoV-2 in the colon. Results Higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurofilaments were found in EVs but not in plasma from COVID-19 survivors. Additionally, COVID-19 participants exhibited altered monocyte activation markers and elevated cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Increased activation markers in CD4+ T-cells and decreased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in DCs were observed in COVID-19 participants. Furthermore, the amount of plasmacytoid DCs expressing β7-integrin were higher in COVID-19, potentially associated with the viral persistence observed in the colon. Conclusions COVID-19 survivors exhibit long-term immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring of PASC. The cargo of EVs can be a promising tool for early detection of virus-induced neurological disorders.">

        <tr id="Background The mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after non-severe COVID-19 remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood cells of patients with post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) and assess if distinct clinical subtypes with specific gene signatures could be identified. Methods The cohort included 111 PCC patients from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant era, with 57 recovered (Recov) and 54 having prolonged symptoms indicative of PCC. The results were compared to 63 healthy controls (Ctrl) without known SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data included patient assessments, laboratory results, comorbidities, and questionnaires on quality of life and functioning. Transcriptomic analysis and cellular deconvolution methods were used on total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results PCC patients had more comorbidities (mean 1.3) and more frequently (59%) at least one comorbidity than recovered patients (31%) and controls (24%). Overall, past COVID-19 illness or current PCC symptoms caused minimal changes in the blood cell transcriptome, with only 3–6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified across comparisons. However, a subset of male PCC patients exhibited an increased fraction of deconvoluted erythroblasts and significant genome-wide gene expression changes, with 399 DEGs compared to recovered and control males. These genes were enriched in pathways related to heme metabolism and gas exchange in erythrocytes. Conclusions Persistent symptoms in PCC are multifactorial and not directly linked to peripheral blood cell gene expression changes. However, a subgroup of male PCC patients shows distinct erythrocyte responses that may contribute to long-term symptoms.">

        <tr id="The primary function of microglia is to maintain brain homeostasis. However, in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, the pathophysiological hallmarks that drive disease progression involve neurotoxicity and alterations in neuroinflammation. In this study, we exposed murine neonatal primary microglial cultures to external signals that mimic the in vivo stimuli caused by pathogens, injury, or toxic agents. In the presence of benzoyl ATP (bzATP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we observed a coordinated increase in the expression of interleukins and chemokines. We focused on the dynamics of the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) that are statistically significant (DEMs) and tracked their post-activation dynamics. Monitoring miRNAs 3 and 8 hours (h) post-activation revealed robust changes in 33 and 57 DEMs, most of which were upregulated. The DEMs exhibiting the strongest temporal regulation included miR-155, miR-132, miR-3473e, miR-222, and miR-146b. Additionally, a strong downregulation of miR-3963 was attributed to the exposure to bzATP. Through their regulation of TNFα and NFκB signaling pathways, the identified DEMs reflect the cellular response to inflammatory signals. We incubated the activated cells with ladostigil, a neuroprotective compound that has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and cognitive decline. While there was no significant effect 3 h post-activation, at 8 h, a few miRNAs implicated in inflammation suppression such as miR-27a, miR-27b, and miR-23b were upregulated in a ladostigil-dependent manner. We conclude that the miRNA expression profile provides a sensitive indicator of the regulatory mechanisms underlying inflammation-related responses in microglia. We propose that primary microglia subjected to controlled activation paradigms can serve as a robust model for inflammatory states in the brain to monitor the aging brain along the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="Pathogen-induced septic death presents a substantial public health challenge, with its neuroimmune mechanisms largely unexplored. Our study investigates neurotransmitter modulation of ACOD1 expression, a regulator of immunometabolism activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Screening neurotransmitters identifies dopamine as a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced ACOD1 expression in innate immune cells. Mechanistically, DRD2 forms a complex with TLR4, initiating MAPK3-dependent CREB1 phosphorylation and subsequent ACOD1 transcription. Conversely, dopamine disrupts TLR4-MYD88 interaction via DRD2 without affecting the formation of the LPS-induced TLR4-MD2-CD14 complex. Enhanced ACOD1 expression induces CD274/PD-L1 production independently of itaconate, precipitating inflammation-associated immunosuppression in sepsis. Delayed administration of pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, mitigates lethality in bacterial sepsis mouse models. Conversely, the dopamine antagonist aripiprazole exacerbates sepsis mortality. Dysregulation of the dopamine-ACOD1 axis correlates with sepsis severity in patients, indicating a potential therapeutic target for modulating this neuroimmune pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease acquired through tick bites. We have previously demonstrated the correlation between SFTSV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation induction, disease progression, and fatal outcome. In the current study, our clinical observation study establishes a strong correlation between elevated levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA and poor prognosis. In vivo studies further reveal endothelial cells as an important source responsible for releasing mtDNA into circulation, which promotes B cell activation, migration, and differentiation via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Notably, TLR9 activation enhances B-cell susceptibility to SFTSV infection. These findings suggest that mtDNA released by injured endothelial cells facilitates B cell differentiation and virus replication, emphasizing the significant role of mitochondrial damage within endothelial cells in contributing to the severity of SFTS outcomes. IMPORTANCE Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a new acute tick-borne infectious disease with a high fatality rate of 10%–50%. There is a strong correlation between SFTSV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation induction, disease progression, and fatal outcome. Our research has revealed the crucial role of mtDNA in predicting the prognosis of SFTS and its impact on vascular endothelial injuries as well as B cell differentiation, two previously unexplored features of SFTSV infection. Moreover, mtDNA could activate the TLR9 signal to induce plasmablast differentiation in B cells and promote SFTSV infection. This study provides valuable mechanistic and clinical insights into the adverse outcomes associated with SFTSV infection.

        <tr id="Background Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome predominantly affecting children, with a propensity to induce coronary artery lesions. Aberrant immune activation and cytokines cascade reactions are involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in immune cell communication during the course of KD and to identify potential biomarkers. Methods The study enrolled seven pediatric patients diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease (KD) between December 2019 and December 2021. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was utilized to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Bioinformatics methods including quality control, dimensionality reduction, cell annotation, differential expression analysis, cell communication analysis, and co-expression network analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. Results This study utilized single-cell sequencing technology to uncover the dynamics of immune cell communication during the course of KD, revealing a significant increase in the number of CD14+ monocytes in the early stages of vasculitis, which play a central role in cell-cell communication. SELPLG was identified as a particularly crucial gene in the signal transduction among immune cells. The study also observed various cellular communication patterns of vasculitis at different time points and identified co-expression modules related to ribosomal function, cell proliferation, and immune responses in CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD16+ monocytes. Notably, the expression of the ITK gene in CD14+ monocytes stood out. Furthermore, MHC-I genes were the most active molecules involved in signal transduction, and the expression of CD40 genes increased with the prolongation of vasculitis duration. Conclusion CD14+ monocytes play a pivotal role in cellular communication during the activation process of KD vasculitis, with SELPLG and ITK as important communication signal genes. These findings provide a novel perspective for the discovery of biomarkers, prediction of disease progression, and the development of targeted treatment strategies for KD.

Although vaccination efforts have effectively reduced mortality and transmission rates, a significant proportion of recovered patients—up to 40%—develop long COVID syndrome (LC) or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection (PASC). LC is characterized by the persistence or emergence of new symptoms following initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting the cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune systems. Despite the broad range of clinical symptoms that have been described, the risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms behind LC remain unclear.

In this study, we evaluated whether Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), a serum marker of lung alveolar cell damage, is predictive for disease severity. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. Serum levels of Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), soluble Fas Ligand, cytochrome C, thymus- and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) and of oxidate stress related proteins were analyzed. Clinical patient data were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database. COVID-19 positive patients were divided in two groups according to disease severity. The mean day difference between COVID-19 diagnosis date and sampling date was +11 days. Concentrations of TARC were lower in COVID-19 positive versus COVID-19 negative patients (unpaired t-test, p=0.002). In addition, CC16 serum levels were significantly elevated in sera taken from patients that were admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) (p=0.0082). In a matched cohort, sera taken prior to ICU admission (-3 days) contained higher CC16 levels (paired t-test, p=0.0072). Multivariable analyses adjusted for known risk factors (age, gender, blood counts, lactate dehydrogenase, c-reactive protein, underlying disease) showed that CC16 levels were independently associated to COVID-19 severity (interquartile-range, odds ratio 1.53, p=0.0102). In conclusion, our findings highlight CC16 as a promising biomarker for early identification of severe COVID19 cases, which could improve patient management and resource allocation.">

        <tr id="Preterm sepsis is a major contributor to brain injury and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, but its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study integrated clinical and experimental approaches to investigate the pathological changes linking systemic inflammation to brain injury in preterm infants. Transcriptomic analysis of septic preterm infants’ peripheral blood revealed upregulated immune, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways, suggesting a link between systemic and brain inflammation. Using P2 mice, we established a preterm white matter injury model through multiple doses of lipopolysaccharide, observing dose-dependent developmental delays, brain inflammation, and long-term behavioral deficits. Integrative analyses of peripheral blood and brain samples from both mice and preterm infants revealed consistent chemokine alterations and immune cell infiltration across peripheral and central compartments, highlighting the significant involvement of neutrophil extracellular traps in preterm brain injury. Furthermore, microglia exhibited significant transcriptional changes during the acute phase, accompanied by metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, with suggested involvement of Pgk1 and Pgam1. This shift intensified with escalating inflammation, along with PANoptosis-related gene upregulation, ultimately associated with microglial cell death. Collectively, these findings provide pathological insights into the immunometabolic alterations underlying sepsis-induced preterm brain injury and suggest potential targets for future therapeutic interventions to mitigate long-term neurodevelopmental deficits.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, yet the interplay between peripheral and central immune responses is still only partially understood. Emerging evidence suggests that myeloid cells, when activated in the periphery, infiltrate the ischemic brain and contribute to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through both inflammatory and metabolic mechanisms.


METHODS
In this study, we integrated bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and flow cytometry data from human and mouse models of ischemic stroke. Mouse stroke models were induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), and brain tissues were later collected at specified time points for analysis. We examined time-dependent transcriptional changes in the peripheral blood, delineated cell-type-specific responses by single-cell profiling, and validated myeloid infiltration into the ischemic brain. We also investigated endothelial metabolic reprogramming and oxidative stress by combining scMetabolism analyses (a computational R package for inferring metabolic pathway activity at the single-cell level) with in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) experiments.


RESULTS
Cross-species bulk RNA-seq revealed a modest early immune shift at 3 h post-stroke, escalating significantly by 24 h, with robust myeloid-centric gene signatures conserved in humans and mice. Single-cell analyses confirmed a pronounced expansion of neutrophils, monocytes, and megakaryocytes in peripheral blood, coupled with a decrease in T and B lymphocytes. Spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry demonstrated substantial infiltration of CD11b+ myeloid cells into the infarct core, which showed extensive interaction with endothelial cells. Endothelial scRNA-seq data showed reductions in the oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione, and nicotinate metabolic pathways, together with elevated pentose phosphate pathway activity, suggestive of oxidative stress and compromised antioxidant capacity. Functional scoring further indicated diminished endothelial inflammation/repair potential, while in vitro OGD/R experiments revealed morphological disruption, CD31 downregulation, and increased 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), underscoring the importance of endothelial oxidative damage in BBB breakdown.


CONCLUSIONS
These multi-omics findings highlight the existence of a coordinated peripheral-central immune axis in ischemic stroke, wherein myeloid cell recruitment and endothelial metabolic vulnerability jointly exacerbate inflammation and oxidative stress. The targeting of endothelial oxidative injury and myeloid-endothelial crosstalk may represent a promising strategy to mitigate secondary brain injury in ischemic stroke.">

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection leads to viral encephalitis and neurological damage in mice, causing significant neurological symptoms and brain damage. This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms of PRV-induced encephalopathy and the role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We found that PRV infection increased the number of astrocytes and induced a phenotypic shift from the A2 to the A1 subtype, which was associated with increased secretion of MMP-9. MMP-9 was identified as a critical mediator of PRV-induced BBB disruption, as it degrades collagen VI, leading to BBB damage. PRV was shown to penetrate the BBB via a paracellular pathway, and MMP-9 deletion reversed this damage, mitigating tight junction injury. Additionally, PRV infection caused an “inflammatory storm” in the central nervous system (CNS), with increased levels of the chemokines CCL-3, CCL-4, and CCL-5; the cytokines IL-6 and IL-18; and TNF-α. The expression of INF-γ was significantly decreased. In conclusion, PRV infection disrupts the BBB and induces an inflammatory response in the CNS, with MMP-9 playing a key role in mediating BBB damage. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of PRV-induced encephalopathy and potential therapeutic targets for viral encephalitis.">

        <tr id="Background Long-COVID immunopathogenesis involves diverse factors. We longitudinally characterize hospitalized COVID-19 patients, examining the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and inflammation in immune dysregulation. Methods Hospitalized patients are evaluated during acute infection (T0), 3 months post-symptom onset (T1), and 3 years if symptoms persisted (T2). Immune profile includes characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-specific T/B cells (flow cytometry) and antibodies (ELISA, neutralization, ADCC). RNAemia and cytokines are quantified (RT-PCR, cytometric beads array) and correlated. Statistics: non-parametric cross-sectional, longitudinal and correlation analyses. Results Here we show 48 hospitalized individuals during acute COVID-19, 38 exhibit early persistent symptoms (EPS+) 3 months post-symptoms onset, 10 do not (EPS−). Groups are comparable for age, sex, co-morbidities. The EPS+ shows fatigue, dyspnoea, anosmia/dysgeusia, diarrhea, chronic pain, mnestic disorders. Over time, they show a reduction of neutralization ability and total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, with increased total CD4 TEMRA, and failure to increase RBD-specific B cells and IgA+ MBCs. EPS+ patients show higher levels of T0-IFN-γ + CD4 TEMRA, T1-IL-2 + CD4 TEM and T1-TNF-α + CD4 cTfh. In EPS+, baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia positively correlates with CD4 TEMRA, follow-up SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with ADCC. Among 38 EPS+ individuals at T1, 33 are evaluated 3 years after infection, 5 are lost at follow-up. 10/33 EPS+ show long-term symptoms (late persistent symptoms, EPS + LPS+), whereas 23/33 fully recover (EPS + LPS−). Antibodies, RNAemia, and cytokines show no differences between/within groups at any time point. Conclusions Early persistent symptoms are associated with multi-layered SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune dysregulation. The shift towards non-Ag-specific TEMRA and ADCC trigger in EPS+ may relate to SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Early immune dysregulation does not associate with long-term persistent symptoms. Further research on SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and early immune dysregulation is needed.">

        <tr id="Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae (PASC). However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts the brain and leads to persistent behavioral changes remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces neuroinflammation and microglial activation, leading to anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice. Methods: We established a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model using the virulent SARS2-N501YMA30 strain to investigate its impact on the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed neuroinvasion via immunostaining of dsRNA and markers for neuronal, astrocyte, and microglia in brain slices. Behavioral changes were evaluated at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4 months post-infection. Molecular and cellular analyses included bulk RNA-seq, Golgi-Cox staining, field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to assess gene expression, neuronal morphology, and microglial activation in the brain. Results: We demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral assays indicated a marked elevation in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors post-infection. A comparative analysis of RNA expression profiles disclosed alterations in the post-infected brains. Additionally, we observed dendritic spine remodeling on neurons within the amygdala after infection. Infection with SARS2-N501YMA30 was associated with microglial activation and a subsequent increase in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion plays a critical role in the development of lasting behavioral sequelae observed in PASC. These data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.">

        <tr id="The implementation of COVID-19 policy and the rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the early pandemic significantly contained numerous outbreaks and reduced the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, the population immunity induced by existing vaccines was insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The host immunity induced by the wide spread of Omicron variants and its influence on emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are attracting broad attention. In this study, a clinical data analysis of the patients indicated that pre-vaccination reduced inflammatory responses and mitigated the severity of COVID-19 cases caused by natural infection with Omicron BA.5.2. The analysis of adaptive immune responses indicated that natural infection with BA.5.2 induced robust and broad immune responses, including both humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses (IFN-γ) against highly conserved viral antigens, and provided cross-reactive neutralization against various viral variants. Collectively, we report that the natural infection with Omicron BA.5.2 induced broad cross-reactive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, which suggests that the development of a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with desired safety, high efficacy, broad spectrum, and long-term immune persistence is feasible. Therefore, we suggest that herd immunity, achieved through vaccination with attenuated vaccines, combined with booster doses of existing vaccines and antiviral therapy for people with high viral loads, may contribute to the eradication of this virus.">

We further demonstrate through a series of in vitro assays that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-antibody immune complexes can stimulate NETosis. Last, we discuss how this NETosis is more strongly associated with IgA immune complexes than IgG and can be ameliorated with spleen tyrosine kinase inhibition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID‐19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS‐CoV‐2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID‐19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high‐throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID‐19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID‐19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background Hypercapnia, an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) complication after pulmonary sepsis, remains enigmatic in terms of its immunological mechanisms. Our study was designed to compare initial values and longitudinal changes in cellular composition and inflammatory biomarkers between pneumonia sepsis-induced ARDS patients without hypercapnia and hypercapnia patients. Methods Between Dec 2022-Apr 2023, we prospectively studied 61 severe pneumonia patients. Eleven non-sepsis pneumonia patients were controls; 50 patients with pulmonary sepsis met ARDS criteria, 26 among them developed hypercapnia. We collected clinical data, respiratory parameters, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at Day 1 and Day 7 post-intubation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNA-seq) was performed between selected hypercapnia and non-hypercapnia patients to characterize immune and cellular profiles. Specimens were analyzed via flow cytometry and cytokine panel. Results By compiling clinical data and specimens, we found that hypercapnia patients with ARDS had poorer outcomes and higher mortality. At day 1, ScRNA-seq and cytometric analysis revealed increase in monocytes and activation of cytokine storm genes with elevated interleukin (IL) −1β, IL-12p40, and IL-23 in peripheral blood. In hypercapnia patients, percentage of CD14+CD16- classical monocyte and concentrations of IL-12p40 and IL-23 increased from day 1 to day 7 in both circulation and airways. However, these alterations of cellular phenotype and cytokine decreased during seven-treatment period in non-hypercapnia patients. Conclusion We offer novel perspectives on monocyte-centered clusters and associated biomarkers, which play a pivotal role in driving hypercapnia after pulmonary sepsis-induced ARDS. Our study provides fresh insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying hypercapnia in ARDS, laying the foundation for useful therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a key contributor to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, driven by factors such as viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and peripheral inflammation. However, the mechanisms linking peripheral inflammation or viral infections to neuroinflammation remain poorly understood, limiting the development of effective therapies. Proinflammatory cytokines are implicated in these processes but their effects on brain cells, including microglia, remain insufficiently characterized. Here, we demonstrate that IL-21, a proinflammatory cytokine elevated in autoimmune disorders, chronic viral infections, and Alzheimer’s disease, activates microglia and promotes lipid accumulation within these cells. Young, healthy mice injected with IL-21 to mimic chronic exposure exhibited increased proinflammatory cytokine levels and microglial activation in the brain. Notably, microglia in these mice displayed enhanced lipid accumulation, accompanied by upregulation of lipid uptake receptors such as CD36 and TREM-2. These findings were corroborated using the human microglial cell line HMC-3, where IL-21 exposure similarly induced lipid accumulation and increased expression of CD36 and ApoE. Mechanistic investigations revealed that IL-21 upregulates HIF-1α, a transcription factor critical for lipid metabolism and lipid droplet formation. Additionally, we observed elevated IL-21 levels in the circulation of elderly individuals compared to younger counterparts, with IL-21 increases associated with CMV seropositivity. Aged mouse brains mirrored the microglial lipid accumulation and activation patterns seen in IL-21-injected mice. In summary, we identify a novel IL-21-driven mechanism involving lipid accumulation in microglia that contributes to neuroinflammation.

        <tr id="Neutrophils are a granulocytic population of myeloid cells that have critical effector functions during infectious disease but are generally thought to be short-lived and nonproliferative with markedly limited activation states. In these studies, we directly compared lung neutrophil activation following infection with different groups of pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and helminths. Our results demonstrate considerable heterogeneity depending on the type of infectious agent. In contrast to bacterial and fungal infection, after helminth infection neutrophils expressed markers associated with characteristic type 2 responses and unexpectedly upregulated genes associated with cell cycling and protein synthesis. Further studies showed reduced neutrophil cell death following helminth infection and increased proliferation, which was dependent on IL-4R signaling. This distinct subset of proliferating neutrophils expanded following helminth infection and was released from the endothelial niche to colocalize with invading parasites in the airways. These studies demonstrate a novel long-lived cycling phenotype for neutrophils following helminth infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Monocytes are central to the innate immune system’s response to infection or injury. In murine, these cells are classified into distinct subsets: classical monocytes, defined by elevated Ly6C expression (Ly6Chi), intermediate monocytes (Ly6Cint), and non-classical inflammatory monocytes, characterized by low Ly6C expression (Ly6Clow). Monocytes recruited to tissues differentiate into macrophages, which can be pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory, thereby influencing disease processes and outcomes. The principal function of classical monocytes is the mediation of pro-inflammatory reactions, whereas non-classical monocytes are associated with repair and anti-inflammatory processes, patrolling the lumen of the vessels. Growing evidence highlights the importance of monocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies indicate that modulation of the innate immune system, focusing specifically on the shift from Ly6Chi to Ly6Clow monocytes, is an effective therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and MS. This transition is crucial for switching the immune response from inflammation to tissue repair and inflammation resolution, emphasizing the plasticity of monocytes and their potential as targets in MS. This review differs from prior studies in that it focuses solely on animal models of MS, which either directly perturb or study monocytes, or where therapeutic approaches mediate their protective effects through monocytes. Such details permit a subtle comprehension of monocyte dynamics in the context of MS.">

        <tr id="Identifying immune markers driving early and effective antibody response in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical due to the threat of future coronavirus pandemics, incomplete global vaccination, and suboptimal booster coverage. Patients with life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are characterized by dysregulated thromboinflammation and cytokine storm that could influence the isotype virus-specific antibody response and the subsequent clinical outcome. We investigated the association between COVID-19-related mortality with the dynamics, magnitude, and relative avidity of nucleoprotein (N), spike (S), and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgM, IgA, and IgG in circulation. We also assessed the relationship between the virus-specific antibody responses and cytokine patterns, as well as systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation markers. This multicenter study included COVID-19 patients hospitalized early in the pandemic, classified as survivors (n=62) and non-survivors (n=17). We developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to evaluate each virus-specific isotype using well-characterized outpatient COVID-19 (n=180) and pre-pandemic cohorts (n=111). The pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, as well as the regulatory IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNFRI) levels were evaluated. The ELISAs performed highly for all virus-specific isotypes, although modest for IgM-N. Non-survivors increased N-specific, but no S-specific, IgM and IgA responses throughout the disease course and, more notably, a delayed class switching to IgG-S and IgG-RBD compared to survivors. No differences were observed in the virus-specific IgG relative avidity. Survivors exhibited an antibody response proportional to the degree of systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation, whereas non-survivors showed those dissociated because of their uncontrolled severe thromboinflammation. Only the survivors showed a dominant regulatory cytokine pattern in the early phase of infection (<10 days after symptoms onset), which strongly correlated with developing IgG-S and IgG-RBD protective antibodies. We developed easy-to-use immune assays that enable patient monitoring and identify at-risk populations in low- to middle-income regions. Non-survivors displayed an ineffective N-mediated antibody response, marked by an inability to control inflammation and a compromised time-dependent class switching toward S and RBD-specific IgG. The regulatory cytokine axis, including TGF-β1, maybe a critical immune correlate of effective antibody-mediated immunity in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), brought about by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly impacted public health and the economy. A fundamental aspect of addressing this virus lies in elucidating the mechanisms through which it induces disease. Our study reveals that Non-structural protein 6 (NSP6) of SARS-CoV-2 promotes the initiation of autophagy by activating Beclin1. In the later stage of autophagy, however, NSP6 causes a blockage in the autophagy–lysosome degradation via the inhibition of Mucolipin 1 (MLN1). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) L37F in NSP6, which is associated with asymptomatic infection, similarly enhances the initiation of autophagy but displays a reduced ability to impede lysosome-dependent degradation. In summary, we demonstrated the dual-regulation mechanism of NSP6 in autophagy, which may be one of the reasons for targeting cellular autophagy to induce viral pathogenesis. This finding may provide promising new directions for future research and clinical interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with ACE2, a key receptor within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis, regulating blood pressure, and modulating inflammation. An observational study analyzed the gene expression profiles of RAAS receptors and associated miRNAs in 88 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls, comparing the acute and post-acute phases to assess their impact on disease severity and recovery. Our findings revealed an association between reduced MAS1 expression in both advanced age (P = 0.03) and the need for oxygen supplementation (P = 0.04). Additionally, reduced ACE expression was associated with worse mortality outcomes (P = 0.01). Notably, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) in individuals requiring oxygen supplementation and in those with diabetes mellitus during both the acute and post-COVID-19 phases, further highlighting the impact of these conditions on RAAS. The miRNA analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-200c (P = 0.005), miR-let-7 (P = 0.01), and miR-122 (P = 0.03) in acute-phase COVID-19 patients. This dysregulation contributes to the inflammatory response and highlights the interaction between viral entry and immune regulation. These results underscore the significance of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MAS1 axis in inflammation regulation and suggest that targeting this pathway may have therapeutic potential. Our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and identifies the modulation of RAAS receptors and miRNAs as promising biomarkers for disease severity and potential therapeutic interventions.

A developing perspective suggests that TLRs play a central role in neuroinflammation, a fundamental factor in neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This comprehensive review consolidates current research investigating the potential interplay between TLRs, their signaling mechanisms, and the processes of neurodegeneration following SARS-CoV-2 infection with an aim to elucidate the involvement of TLRs in the long-term neurological complications of COVID-19 and explore the potential of targeting TLRs as a means of implementing intervention strategies for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19-associated long-term brain outcomes.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can provide information on patient immunity, identify asymptomatic patients, and track the spread of COVID-19. Efforts have been made to develop methods to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Here, we describe a flow cytometric assay for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in human plasma. To assess the antibody response against the different SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, five viral recombinant proteins, including spike protein subunit 1 (S1), N-terminal domain of S1 (S1A), spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein subunit 2 (S2), and nucleocapsid protein (N), were generated. A comparison of the antibody profiles detected by the assay with plasma from 100 healthy blood donors collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and plasma from 100 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated a clear discrimination between the two groups. Among the COVID-19 patients, the antibody responses for the viral proteins, as determined by their prevalence, were anti-RBD IgG = anti-N IgG > anti-S1 IgG > anti-S1A IgG > anti-S2 IgG, and anti-RBD IgM > anti-S1 IgM > anti-N IgM > anti-S2 IgM. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM was not associated with sex, age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness, except for a higher prevalence of anti-S2 IgG being observed in men than in women. The levels of anti-RBD IgG were higher in patients 65 years and older and in patients who had severe symptoms. Similarly, patients who had severe symptoms exhibited higher levels of anti-S1 and anti-S1A IgG than patients who had mild or moderate symptoms. The levels of anti-RBD IgM tended to be higher in men but did not differ among age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness. Our study indicates that the flow cytometric assay, especially using RBD as target antigen, can be used to detect simultaneously anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in human plasma.">

        <tr id="Background Processes related to how the intracranial microvasculature initiates brain‒peripheral crosstalk for subsequent blood‒brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction at an early stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) ictus are still unknown. This study elucidated the effect and potential mechanism of intracranial microvasculature-mediated T-cell infiltration on BBB function after SAH. Methods Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data related to SAH (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/omix; Accession No. OMIX006611) were retrieved and analyzed. The dataset was derived from the white matter region of adult male C57BL/6J mice at 1 and 7 days after experimental SAH. The SAH model was induced by endovascular perforation, and experiments were subsequently conducted at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after SAH to evaluate T-cell infiltration, BBB integrity, neuronal injury, and neurological function. Results After SAH, CXCL12 expression was increased in endothelial cells and pericytes, promoting CD8+ T-cell infiltration via the CXCR4 pathway. This immune infiltration appeared to exacerbate BBB disruption and contribute to worsened neurological function. Blocking CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling with a CXCL12 neutralizing antibody or the CXCR4-specific inhibitor AMD3100 significantly reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration, attenuated BBB damage and improved the neurobehavioral outcomes of SAH mice. Conclusion This study suggests that, following SAH, both pericytes and endothelial cells may contribute to immune regulation by producing CXCL12, which promotes CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration into the brain. This mechanism may play a role in BBB disruption and neurological dysfunction. Targeting the CXCL12–CXCR4 axis could offer a potential approach for mitigating immune-mediated injury after SAH.

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke triggers a cascade of pathological events that affect multiple cell types and often lead to incomplete functional recovery. Despite advances in single-cell technologies, the molecular and cellular responses that contribute to long-term post-stroke impairment remain poorly understood. To gain better insight into the underlying mechanisms, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from distinct brain regions using a mouse model of permanent focal ischemia at one month post-injury. Our findings reveal cell- and region-specific changes within the stroke-injured and peri-infarct brain tissue. For instance, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exhibited upregulated genes in signaling pathways involved in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, and downregulated pathways associated with aerobic metabolism. Using cell-cell communication analysis, we identified increased strength in predicted interactions within stroke tissue among both neural and non-neural cells via signaling pathways such as those involving collagen, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, neuronal growth regulator, laminin, and several cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between mouse transcriptome responses after stroke and those observed in human nonfatal brain stroke lesions. Common molecular features were linked to inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix organization, and angiogenesis. Our findings provide a detailed resource for advancing our molecular understanding of stroke pathology and for discovering therapeutic targets in the repair phase of stroke recovery.

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to the emergence of viral variants with distinct characteristics. Understanding the differential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial for effective public health response and treatment development. We investigated the differential effects of the original Wuhan strain and the emergent Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 using a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. We compared the mortality rates, viral loads, and histopathological changes in lung and tracheal tissues, as well as alterations in the lung and intestinal microbiota following infection. Results Our findings revealed significant differences between the variants, with the Wuhan strain causing higher mortality rates, severe lung pathology, and elevated viral loads compared to the Omicron variant. Microbiome analyses uncovered novel and distinct shifts in the lung and intestinal microbiota associated with each variant, providing evidence for variant-specific microbiome alterations. These changes suggest microbiome-related mechanisms that might modulate disease severity and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions This study highlights critical differences between the Wuhan strain and Omicron variant in terms of mortality, lung pathology, and microbiota changes, emphasizing the role of the microbiome in influencing disease outcomes. Novel findings include the identification of variant-specific microbiota shifts, which underscore potential microbiome-related mechanisms underlying differences in disease severity. These insights pave the way for future research exploring microbiome-targeted interventions to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.

Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to conduct a comprehensive mapping of immune cell enrichment and interactions within atherosclerotic plaques, aiming to investigate the cellular and molecular complexities of these structures. This approach facilitated a deeper understanding of the heterogeneities present in smooth muscle cells, which were subsequently analyzed using pseudotime trajectory analysis to monitor the developmental trajectories of smooth muscle cell (SMC) subpopulations. An integrative bioinformatics approach, primarily utilizing Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning techniques, identified Cathepsin C (CTSC), transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFBI), and glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG) as critical biomarkers. A diagnostic risk score model was developed and rigorously tested through Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. To illustrate the functional impact of CTSC on the regulation of plaque formation and SMC viability, both in vitro and in vivo experimental investigations were conducted. Results: An analysis revealed SMCs identified as the most prominent cellular type, exhibiting the highest density of disulfidptosis. Pseudotime trajectory analysis illuminated the dynamic activation pathways in SMCs, highlighting their significant role in plaque development and instability. Further characterization of macrophage subtypes demonstrated intercellular communication with SMCs, which exhibited specific signaling pathways, particularly between the proximal and core areas of plaques. The integrated diagnostic risk score model, which incorporates CTSC, TGFBI, and GMFG, proved to be highly accurate in distinguishing high-risk patients with elevated immune responses and systemic inflammation. Knockdown experiments of CTSC conducted in vitro revealed enhanced SMC survival rates, reduced oxidative stress, and inhibited apoptosis, while in vivo experiments confirmed a decrease in plaque burden and improvement in lipid profiles. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the significance of disulfidptosis in the development of atherosclerosis and identifies CTSC as a potential therapeutic target for stabilizing plaques by inhibiting SMC apoptosis and oxidative damage. Additionally, the risk score model serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying high-risk patients and guiding precision treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="How extracellular vesicles (EVs) may contribute to mechanisms of primary intracellular pathogenesis in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains unknown. To critically advance our understanding of how EVs influence early-stage PD pathogenesis, we tested the hypothesis that rats acutely exposed to the PD neurotoxin rotenone would produce differential miRNAs in CSF/serum-derived EVs and that such modulation would be responsible for PD-relevant functional alterations in recipient neuronal cells. We discovered that acute rotenone treatment produced significant and specific serum miRNA alterations. Primary midbrain neurons treated with serum EVs from rotenone-exposed rats produced oxidative stress, mitochondrial toxicity, and cell loss in neuronal culture. These mechanisms were dependent on miR-30a-5p and miR-484. Thus, this study has elucidated that differential expression of miRNAs in circulating EVs from serum/CSF of rats is a potential early diagnostic marker for PD, and that the modulation of cellular functions and viability due to extracellular vesicles determines the pathological fate.">

        <tr id="Introduction Syphilis is a complex disease with variable clinical presentation where symptomatic and potentially infectious stages alternate with periods of latency, representing a fascinating model to study immune evasion and host immune responses. Methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC), bulk, and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin biopsies collected from subjects with secondary syphilis. Additionally, PBMCs from healthy individuals and either primary or MyD88 knock-out keratinocytes were exposed to live Treponema pallidum cells to define initial skin responses to the bacteria. Results Immunohistochemistry of secondary syphilis skin lesions showed a polymorphous immune infiltrate with colocalization of T cells, B cells and antigen–presenting cells. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct cellular contributions to the immune response, with prominent immune-stromal crosstalk accompanied by altered keratinocyte differentiation and decreased intraepidermal communication. Notably, prominent inflammatory signals were countered by concomitant regulatory responses, particularly in infiltrating myeloid cells. Exposure of PBMCs to live T. pallidum inhibited immune responses, while exposure to sonicated cells triggered CXCL1 and CXCL3 upregulation. Keratinocytes responded to both intact and sonicated T. pallidum with upregulation of type-I interferon responses that, however, were abolished in MYD88–deficient but not in STING–deficient keratinocytes. Discussion Our data provide novel insights into the contribution of epidermal TLR sensing through MYD88 to the host response to syphilis infection, highlighting mechanisms by which T. pallidum evades immune responses in skin that may facilitate transmission of this pathogen through the skin.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has posed significant healthcare challenges. In addition to respiratory complications, it has led to severe damage in other organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Of which, myocardial injury is increasingly recognized as a most significant complication, contributing to the high mortality. Recent research indicates the pivotal role of immune dysregulation in mediating myocardial injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the immune mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced myocardial damage, focusing on the roles of key immune cells and molecules that contribute to this pathological process. Aiming at mitigating the myocardial injury of COVID-19, we review immune-based treatments under evaluation in preclinical and clinical trials. Along with talking about the similarities and differences in myocardial injury resulting from SARS-CoV-2, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This article provides a unique perspective on using past experiences to prevent myocardial injury in the face of ongoing virus mutations.">

        <tr id="Introduction Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to COVID19 disease and caused a worldwide pandemic in 2019. Since the first wave of infections, there has been significant antigenic shifts, leading to the emergence of new variants. Today, infections have shifted away from the severe, fatal infection seen in 2019. Objective This study aimed to assess how the plasma metabolomes from patients varied with infection with different strains and could reflect disease severity. Methods Patients with COVID19 not requiring intensive care were recruited between January 2021 and May 2022 from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham; 33 patients with alpha, 13 delta and 14 omicron variants. These were compared to 26 age matched contemporaneously recruited controls. Plasma samples were extracted into chloroform/methanol/water (1:2.5/1 v/v) and assessed by flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (FIE-MS) using an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Derived data were assessed using the R based MetaboAnalyst platform. Results Plasma metabolomes from COVID19 patients were clearly different from controls. Metabolite variation could be related to infection with different SARS-CoV2 variants. Variant showed different levels of some phospholipids, ganglioside GD1a and a dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivative. Correlations of the plasma metabolomes indicated negative correlations between selected phospholipids and the levels of C-reactive protein, creatinine, neutrophil and D-dimer. Conclusion The plasma metabolomes of COVID19 patients show changes, particularly in phospholipids, which could reflect disease severity and SARS-CoV2 variant infection.

        <tr id="Background Septic shock is linked with high mortality and significant long-term morbidity in survivors. However, the specific role of neutrophils in septic shock pathophysiology remains scarce in recent research. Methods Peripheral blood immune cells from healthy donors and patients with septic shock were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing and batch RNA sequencing. We measured serum CD121b in both patients and healthy donors. Peripheral immune cells were isolated and exposed to either a CD121b recombinant protein or a CD121b blocking antibody to evaluate the expression of inflammatory factors. Additionally, in a humanized mouse sepsis model, the expression of CD121b in neutrophils across different tissues was assessed following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Results This study identified a subset of CD10-CD121b+ neutrophils in the peripheral blood of patients with septic shock. These patients exhibited elevated concentrations of soluble CD121b in serum and urine. Furthermore, outcomes revealed that the presence of CD121b+ neutrophils positively correlated with the severity of septic shock. These cells displayed immunosuppressive characteristics; after blocking CD121b, proinflammatory cytokines increased in peripheral immune cells. Additionally, we found that treatment with ATRA down-regulated the expression of CD121b. Conclusions CD121b is closely associated with the progression of septic shock and may serve as a potential predictor indicator of immunosuppression for the condition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Hypervirulent fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) has emerged as a significant poultry pathogen since 2015, exhibiting clinical multi-organ and multi-tissue tropism post-infection, resulting in substantial economic losses in the poultry industry. However, the molecular mechanism underlying kidney injury caused by FAdV-4 infection remains unclear. Our results indicated that FAdV-4 infection in chickens induces damage to kidney tissues, characterized by the degeneration and necrosis of kidney epithelial cells, glomerular injury, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the activation of a robust inflammatory response in the kidney cells. Notably, autophagosome-like vesicles enclosed clusters of viral particles that were transmitted between kidney cells post-infection. There might be a novel mechanism of vesicle-mediated cell-to-cell transmission of hypervirulent FAdV-4 that hijacks autophagosome-like vesicles. We also investigated cellular autophagy in kidney cells in vivo and in vitro during early FAdV-4 infection. The autophagy-related marker proteins LC3B, ATG5, and BECN1 were upregulated post-infection, whereas SQSTM1 was downregulated, indicating that FAdV-4 infection enhances autophagic flux and induces complete autophagy. The viral structural protein Fiber 2 was also observed to colocalize with the autophagy-related marker protein LC3B and the exosome-specific marker protein CD63 in the kidney cells at 24 hpi, suggesting that FAdV-4-induced cellular autophagy promotes viral replication in kidney cells and that autophagosome-like vesicles are involved in early FAdV-4 replication in vivo in chickens. Our results offer novel insights into the pathogenesis of hypervirulent FAdV-4 from the perspective of kidney injury post-infection. IMPORTANCE Hypervirulent fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) has become globally prevalent since 2015 as a predominant pathogen on poultry farms, leading to substantial economic losses for the poultry industry. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying kidney injury induced by FAdV-4 infection remain unclear. In this study, we primarily elucidated the mechanisms of kidney injury induced by FAdV-4 infection in chickens, utilizing both in vitro and in vivo models. Our results demonstrate that FAdV-4 infection in chickens causes degeneration and necrosis of kidney epithelial cells, glomerular injury, and expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum, while also triggering a robust inflammatory response in kidney cells. Notably, we observed the cell-to-cell transmission of virus particles delivered by autophagosome-like vesicles, and the viral infection-induced cellular autophagy facilitated viral replication in the kidney cells. These findings offer a novel perspective to understand the molecular mechanisms of FAdV-4-induced kidney injury and establish a basis for further investigation into the molecular pathogenesis of hypervirulent FAdV-4.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 variants present diverse clinical manifestations, necessitating deeper insights into their pathogenic effects. This study employs multi-omics approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on vascular damage. Plasma proteomic analysis of unvaccinated participants infected with Omicron BA.2.76 or ancestral variants identifies key signaling pathways associated with endothelial dysfunction, with the vinculin (VCL) pathway emerging as a hallmark of Omicron infections, contributing to lung exudation. Metabolomic analysis of plasma samples from the same cohort reveals disruptions in immune function, cell membrane integrity, and metabolic processes, including altered tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis pathways. An integrated analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data underscores the role of VCL in inflammation and extravasation, highlighting its interactions with adhesion molecules and inflammatory metabolites. A validation cohort of plasma samples from Omicron-infected participants confirms this association by replicating proteomic analysis, showing elevated VCL levels correlated with inflammatory markers. Functional studies in a male rat model of lung injury demonstrate that anti-VCL intervention reduces plasma VCL levels, mitigates alveolar edema, and restores alveolar-capillary barrier integrity, as assessed by histological staining and electron microscopy, thereby illustrating VCL modulation’s impact on vascular leakage and extravasation. These findings establish VCL as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating vascular complications in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated a global pandemic resulting in an estimated 775 million infections with over 7 million deaths, it has become evident that COVID-19 is not solely a pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence has shown that, in a subset of patients, certain symptoms − including chest pain, stroke, anosmia, dysgeusia, diarrhea and abdominal pain – all indicate a role of vascular, neurological and gastrointestinal (GI) pathology in the disease process. Many of these disease processes persist long after the acute disease has been resolved, resulting in ‘long COVID’ or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The molecular mechanisms underlying the acute and systemic conditions associated with COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Appropriate animal models provide a method of understanding underlying disease mechanisms at the system level through the study of disease progression, tissue pathology, immune system response to the pathogen and behavioral responses. However, very few studies have addressed PASC and whether existing models hold promise for studying this challenging problem. Here, we review the current literature on cardiovascular, neurological and GI pathobiology caused by COVID-19 in patients, along with established animal models of the acute disease manifestations and their prospects for use in PASC studies. Our aim is to provide guidance for the selection of appropriate models in order to recapitulate certain aspects of the disease to enhance the translatability of mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="The SAR-CoV-2 virus has evolved to co-exist with human hosts, albeit at a substantial energetic cost resulting in post-infection neurological manifestations [Neuro-post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)] that significantly impact public health and economic productivity on a global scale. One of the main molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of Neuro-PASC, in individuals of all ages, is the formation and inadequate proteolysis/clearance of phase-separated amyloid crystalline aggregates—a hallmark feature of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders. Amyloidogenesis during viral infection and persistence is a natural, inevitable, protective defense response that is exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2. Acting as chemical catalyst, SARS-CoV-2 accelerates hydrophobic collapse and the heterogeneous nucleation of amorphous amyloids into stable β-sheet aggregates. The clearance of amyloid aggregates is most effective during slow wave sleep, when high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—a biphasic modulator of biomolecular condensates—and melatonin are available to solubilize amyloid aggregates for removal. The dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics by SARS-CoV-2, in particular fusion and fission homeostasis, impairs the proper formation of distinct mitochondrial subpopulations that can remedy challenges created by the diversion of substrates away from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis to support viral replication and maintenance. The subsequent reduction of ATP and inhibition of melatonin synthesis during slow wave sleep results in incomplete brain clearance of amyloid aggregates, leading to the development of neurological manifestations commonly associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Exogenous melatonin not only prevents mitochondrial dysfunction but also elevates ATP production, effectively augmenting the solubilizing effect of the adenosine moiety to ensure the timely, optimal disaggregation and clearance of pathogenic amyloid aggregates in the prevention and attenuation of Neuro-PASC.">

        <tr id="Neuronal apoptosis is an early and critical pathological hallmark of many chronic neurodegenerative diseases, often occurring silently long before the appearance of overt clinical symptoms. In this study, we engineered astrocytes utilizing a dual-biomarker recognition synNotch system (dual-synNotch). This system is designed to specifically identify neuronal apoptosis through the ‘AND Gate’ activation mechanism, which is triggered by the simultaneous sensing of the apoptotic signal phosphatidylserine (PS) and the neuronal signal ganglioside Gt1b. Upon detection of these neuronal apoptotic signals, the synNotch receptors are activated, inducing the expression of two key molecules: secreted Gaussia luciferase (GLuc), a highly detectable reporter that can cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neuroprotective molecule that promotes neuronal survival by inhibiting apoptosis and enhancing memory and cognitive function. This engineered system effectively converts and amplifies early, imperceptible neuronal apoptotic signals into detectable outputs, enabling convenient in vitro monitoring and diagnosis. Therefore, it represents a promising strategy for the early detection and intervention of neurodegenerative diseases associated with neuronal apoptosis.">

        <tr id="Although the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the emergence of the post-COVID-19 condition presents a new and complex public health challenge, characterized by persistent, multisystem symptoms that can endure for weeks or months after the initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, significantly affecting survivors’ quality of life. Among the most concerning sequelae are cardiovascular complications, which encompass a broad spectrum of conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial damage, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This narrative review explores the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular health by reviewing the latest and most relevant findings in the literature and highlighting different aspects of COVID-19’s cardiovascular involvement. This review investigates the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular involvement in the post-COVID-19 condition, with a focus on direct viral invasion via ACE2 receptors, immune-mediated cardiovascular injury, cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and mitochondrial injury. The interplay between pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, and COVID-19 is also explored, revealing that individuals with such conditions are at heightened risk for both severe acute illness and long-term complications. Long-term immune activation and the persistence of viral antigens are increasingly recognized as contributors to ongoing cardiovascular damage, even in individuals with mild or asymptomatic initial infections. As the healthcare system continues to adapt to the long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a deeper understanding of these cardiovascular manifestations is essential. This knowledge will inform the development of targeted strategies for prevention, clinical management, and rehabilitation of affected patients. Furthermore, the insights gained from the intersection of COVID-19 and cardiovascular health will be instrumental in shaping responses to future viral epidemics, highlighting the necessity for multidisciplinary approaches to patient care and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="Since its emergence in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has continuously evolved, giving rise to multiple variants that have significantly altered the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants have resulted in multiple waves of the pandemic, exhibiting characteristic mutations in the spike (S) protein that may have affected receptor interaction, tissue tropism, and cell entry mechanisms. While the virus was shown to primarily utilize the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and host proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for entry into host cells, alterations in the S protein have resulted in changes to receptor binding affinity and use of alternative receptors, potentially expanding the virus’s ability to infect different cell types or tissues, contributing to shifts in clinical presentation. These changes have been linked to variations in disease severity, the emergence of new clinical manifestations, and altered transmission dynamics. In this paper, we overview the evolving receptor utilization strategies of SARS-CoV-2, focusing on how mutations in the S protein may have influenced viral entry mechanisms and clinical outcomes across the ongoing pandemic waves.">

        <tr id="Background Defining the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is critical for informing the management of reinfections, vaccinations, and therapeutics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Using four antibody assays, we evaluated antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and receptor binding domain (RBD) in 98 convalescent participants with varying COVID-19 disease severities (asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe) at 1, 3, 6, and 12-months post-SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR and in 17 non-vaccinated, non-infected controls. Results Increasing acute COVID-19 disease severity correlates with higher anti-N and anti-RBD titers throughout 12 months post-infection. Anti-N and anti-RBD titers decline over time in all participants, except for increased anti-RBD titers post-vaccination, with hospitalized participants exhibiting faster decay rates. Less than 50% of participants retain anti-N titers above controls at 12 months, with non-hospitalized participants falling below controls sooner. Nearly all participants maintain anti-RBD titers above controls for 12 months, suggesting long-term protection against severe reinfections. Nonetheless, by 6 months, few participants retain >50% of their initial 1-month anti-N or anti-RBD titers. Notably, vaccine-induced anti-RBD titers are higher in non-hospitalized participants. Lastly, early convalescent titers correlate with age but not with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) status or steroid use. Conclusion Hospitalized participants initially develop higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers that decline faster relative to non-hospitalized participants. While anti-N titers fall below control levels in some participants, anti-RBD titers remain above controls over 12 months, demonstrating long-lived antibody responses known to protect against severe disease. These findings advance our understanding of COVID-19 antibody dynamics.">

        <tr id="Introduction SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) share similarities in their modes of transmission, pathophysiological symptoms, and clinical manifestations. An imbalance in the immune response characterised by elevated levels of some inflammatory cytokines caused by tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 may increase the risk of developing a severe disease-like condition. It has been reported that TB increases the expression levels of Ace2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) and Tmprss2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) proteins, which are essential for COVID-19 pathogenesis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variants of ace2 and tmprss2 genes can impact virus and host-cell interactions and alter immune responses by modulating cytokine production. This may modify the susceptibility and/or severity in COVID-19-infected people. The role of SNPs in ace2 and tmprss2 in relation to Mtb and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection is relatively underexplored. Method In this study, genotype frequency of 10 SNPs of ace2 and 03 SNPs of tmprss2 genes in a Cameroonian cohort consisting of COVID-19-positive (n = 31), TB-positive (n = 43), TB-COVID-19 co-infected (n = 21), and a control group (n = 24) were studied. The immune response was estimated by quantitating inflammatory cytokine levels alongside self-reported and clinically diagnosed symptoms. The relationship between specific genetic mutations in these ace2 gene SNPs and their impact on cytokine expression levels in Mtb and SARS-CoV-2 co-infected patients was investigated. Results We identified wild-type, heterozygous, and double-mutant genotypes in seven SNPs (rs2285666, rs6632677, rs4646116, rs4646140, rs147311723, rs2074192 and rs4646142) in ace2 gene, which showed significant variations in distribution across the study groups. Our most significant findings include the association of double mutant alleles (AA) of rs4646140 and rs2074192 in the ace2 gene with decreased IL-6 and IL-2 expression levels respectively in TB-COVID-19 participants. Also, the double mutant alleles (AA) of rs4646116 were responsible for increased expression level of IL-2 in TB-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, elevated serum levels of AST, urea, and D-dimer, as well as increased plasma concentrations of IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, have been associated with co-infections involving Mtb and SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion These biomarkers may reflect the complex interplay between the two pathogens and their impact on host immune responses and disease progression. This study highlights the critical role of genetic and immunological factors in shaping altered immune responses during co-infections involving Mtb and SARS-CoV-2. By elucidating these factors, the findings provide a foundation for a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions and their implications for disease progression and outcomes. Furthermore, this research has the potential to drive advancements in diagnostic approaches enabling more accurate detection and monitoring of co-infections.">

        <tr id="Background Febrile seizures (FS) are the most prevalent convulsive disorder in children characterized by a high recurrence rate. However, the interaction between adaptive and innate immunity in the recurrence of FS remains poorly understood, and the molecular pathways involved are unclear. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of Th17 cells in seizure susceptibility following complex febrile seizures (CFS), and to explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying Th17 cell differentiation and function under hyperthermic conditions through transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Methods RNA sequencing was employed to validate the seizure susceptibility following CFS and to explore the potential mechanisms by which high temperature contributes to Th17 cell differentiation. Neuronal excitability and damage were examined using Multi-electrode array (MEA) analysis and Nissl staining. Flow cytometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, and immunofluorescence (IF) were applied to examine how TRPV1 facilitates Th17 cell differentiation. Results Our study demonstrates that proinflammatory Th17 cells exhibit enhanced differentiation in a CFS mouse model and exacerbate blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. After infiltrating the central nervous system (CNS), Th17 cells promote neuroinflammation by activating microglia via IL-17A. Mechanistically, TRPV1 is critical for Th17 cell differentiation and function. Activated by febrile temperature both in vivo and in vitro, TRPV1 facilitates calcium ion influx, leading to the nuclear localization of nuclear factor of activated T cell 2 and 4 (NFAT2/4) and the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Knockdown of TRPV1 attenuates Th17 cell differentiation and CNS infiltration, thereby protecting the BBB and reducing seizure susceptibility following CFS. Conclusion These results highlight the critical interplay between adaptive and innate immunity in CFS. The TRPV1/NFATs/STAT3 signaling pathway regulates Th17 cell differentiation and function under febrile conditions, revealing a promising therapeutic target for intervention.

        <tr id="The role of immune metabolism, specific metabolites and cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic metabolic states across the time course of an inflammatory response are emerging knowledge. Targeted and untargeted metabolomic analysis is essential to understand how immune cells adapt their metabolic program throughout an immune response. In addition, metabolomic analysis can aid to identify pathophysiological patterns in inflammatory disease. Here, we discuss new metabolomic findings within the transition from inflammation to resolution, focusing on three key programs of immunity: Efferocytosis, IL-10 signaling and trained immunity. Particularly the tryptophan-derived metabolite kynurenine was identified as essential for efferocytosis and inflammation resolution as well as a potential biomarker in diverse inflammatory conditions. In summary, metabolomic analysis and integration with transcriptomic and proteomic data, high resolution imaging and spatial information is key to unravel metabolic drivers and dependencies during inflammation and progression to tissue-repair.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 infection has been responsible of COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) pandemia and can cause a variety of symptoms including gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal pain and liver injury. The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is expressed in gut and SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce vascular damage and immune system dysregulation, creating an inflammatory and hypercoagulable state, as widely described at the lung level. Case presentation This work presents the case of a middle-aged Caucasian man admitted to the Hospital Emergency Department from the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy), complaining of pain in the upper and middle region of the abdomen. The patient tested negative to the nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks after recovering from viral infection. The patient required resection of a segment of ileum and an ulcer of the bowel wall was recognized and sampled. Previous published results had confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, an increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) and an altered morphology of microvilli in the ulcerated ileum of the patient when compared to the non-ulcerated ileum. The present study sought to deepen the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, we evaluated the expression and co-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibronectin by immunohistochemical techniques. VEGF immunohistochemical expression was higher in the ulcer than in the control ileum sample and the non-ulcerated ileum areas and co-expressed with the SPIKE protein. Fibronectin staining was lower in control sample than in non-ulcerated and ulcerated ileum. Electron microscopy analysis showed alterations of the integrity of the intestinal barrier in the ulcerated area when compared to the non-ulcerated ileum or to the control sample. Conclusions Although the patient was tested negative to nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, the SPIKE protein was detected in his terminal ileum, especially in the ulcerated areas. The presence of the viral protein was also associated with an increase of VEGF and Fibronectin. In addition to vascular changes, the SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the junctional apparatus among epithelial cells, making the tissue even more fragile and thus susceptible to the entry of pathogens and the development of further infections.">

        <tr id="Background Neuropathological and clinical studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may increase the long-term risk of neurodegeneration. Methods We provide a narrative overview of pathological and clinical observations justifying the implementation of a surveillance program to monitor changes in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the years after COVID-19. Results Autopsy studies revealed diverse changes in the brain, including loss of vascular integrity, microthromboses, gliosis, demyelination, and neuronal- and glial injury and cell death, in both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals irrespective of the severity of COVID-19. Recent data suggest that microglia play an important role in sustained COVID-19-related inflammation, which contributes to the etiology initiating a neurodegenerative cascade, to the worsening of pre-existing neurodegenerative disease or to the acceleration of neurodegenerative processes. Histopathological data have been supported by neuroimaging, and epidemiological studies also suggested a higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases after COVID-19. Conclusions Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 during the pandemic, healthcare systems should be aware of, and be prepared for a potential increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the upcoming years. Strategies may include follow-up of well-described cohorts, analyses of outcomes in COVID-19-registries, nationwide surveillance programs using record-linkage of ICD-10 diagnoses, and comparing the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the post-pandemic periods to values of the pre-pandemic years. Awareness and active surveillance are particularly needed, because diverse clinical manifestations due to earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may no longer be quoted as post-COVID-19 symptoms, and hence, increasing incidence of neurodegenerative pathologies at the community level may remain unnoticed.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized not only for its acute effects but also for its ability to cause LongCOVID Syndrome (LCS), a condition characterized by persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus’ ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1α activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting autophagy and Nrf2 activation, glycolysis inhibition, and restoration calcium homeostasis may provide novel strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future research should focus on personalized therapeutic interventions based on the dominant molecular perturbations in individual patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the release of interferons (IFNs) and the proinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases. STAT3, a key protein in this pathway, has been implicated in promoting inflammation, making its inhibition a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles (MSC-EVs), enriched with immunomodulatory and antiviral miRNAs, offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating gene expression and regulating inflammatory responses. This study investigates the ability of Lyophilized MSC-EVs to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, highlighting their potential application in COVID-19 management.


METHODS
Male Syrian hamsters were used as an experimental model, housed under controlled laboratory conditions. SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020) was propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titers were determined using plaque assays. Hamsters were intranasally challenged with the virus and treated intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of lyophilized human Wharton's jelly-derived MSC-extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Histopathological evaluations were performed on lung tissues using H&E, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining. Morphometric analyses were conducted to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Western blotting was employed to evaluate protein expression. All procedures adhered to ethical and biosafety guidelines.


RESULTS
The administration of MSC-EVs significantly upregulated the expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-124, miRNA-155, miRNA-29b, miRNA-7, miRNA-145 and miRNA-18a compared to their levels in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a targeted release of miRNA-cargo from the MSC-EVs into the lung tissue of the animals. MSC-EVs impaired the activation of the STAT3/STAT1 signaling pathway and reduced the cytokine storm and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that MSC-EVs have the potential to effectively mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs and their clinical application in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a threat due to the emergence of variants with increased transmissibility and enhanced escape from immune responses. Like other coronaviruses before, SARS-CoV-2 likely emerged after its transmission from bats. The successful propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in humans might have been facilitated by usurping evolutionarily conserved cellular factors to execute crucial steps in its life cycle, such as the generation of replication organelles—membrane structures where coronaviruses assemble their replication-transcription complex. In this study, we found that RAB5, which is highly conserved across mammals, is a critical host dependency factor for the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our results also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 uses RAB5+ membranes to build replication organelles with the aid of COPB1, a component of the COP-I complex, and that the virus protein NSP6 participates in this process. Hence, targeting NSP6 represents a promising approach to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and halt its propagation. IMPORTANCE In this study, we sought to identify the host dependency factors that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses for the generation of replication organelles: cellular membranous structures that SARS-CoV-2 builds in order to support the replication and transcription of its genome. We uncovered that RAB5 is an important dependency factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication and the generation of replication organelles, and that the viral protein NSP6 participates in this process. Hence, NSP6 represents a promising target to halt SARS-CoV-2 replication.

        <tr id="The incidence rate of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is rising. However, the pathogenesis of CAPA remains unclear. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disrupts pathways related to type I interferon and Toll-like receptors, key components in innate immunity, thereby elevating the incidence of CAPA. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in T and B cell functional deficiencies or exhaustion within adaptive immunity, weakening the defense against invasive Aspergillus. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances the replication of cytomegalovirus and alters the gut microbiota, factors that may aid in diagnosing CAPA. Immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 patients is also believed to heighten the risk of invasive aspergillosis. Therefore, this review, examines the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with invasive aspergillosis, and explores the pathogenesis and susceptibility factors of CAPA. We propose that variations in an individual’s immune response significantly determine susceptibility to CAPA. The aim of this paper is to deepen clinical understanding of CAPA’s pathogenesis, thereby aiding in mitigating susceptibility risk and advancing novel treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="Since SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented changes in the epidemiology of other infectious diseases, investigations on coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and one of the famous vector-borne diseases, malaria, are crucial for disease control, especially in malaria-endemic areas. The clinical profiles, possible mechanisms for interactions, and representative control measures of COVID-19 and malaria coinfections have recently garnered public attention. The overlap in epidemiology, infection incubation, and clinical symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria coinfections has been thoroughly discussed to provide a detailed diagnostic procedure for coinfections, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions. Immunological and genetic evidence has shown that previous malaria exposure may protect the body from the poor prognosis of COVID-19. ACE2 downregulation and TLR-induced pathways play a role in this protective effect, as do CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell activation and coinhibitory receptor upregulation, which help maintain a balance of immune reactions. Finally, multiple control measures for coinfections were discussed, and malaria control efforts were enriched in the context of COVID-19. These efforts included (1) developing vaccinations; (2) evaluating the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment; (3) exploring recent advances in natural products that are potentially useful for coinfection treatment; (4) researching and implementing bioinsecticides for malaria control, such as gene-driven mosquitoes, fungi, and bacterial symbionts; and (5) improving national electronic disease surveillance platforms in malaria-endemic regions. At last, the above findings summarized valuable lessons about malaria and COVID-19 control and expedite further investigations on coinfections with complex clinical presentations.

        <tr id="Background & objectives COVID-19 is a complex disease that affects multiple systems and causes inflammation due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s attraction to ACE-2 receptors. The severity of the disease ranges from mild upper respiratory tract infections to multi-organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Critical clinical features, such as respiratory failure, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, and a hypercoagulable state, are common in severe COVID-19 illness. Identifying patients at higher risk of rapid disease progression leading to severe complications and death is crucial. Available biomarkers lack specificity and accuracy in identifying the severity of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, there is a need to identify specific endothelial biomarkers that can predict early organ damage, facilitate effective management of patients, and categorise multisystem involvement during COVID-19 infection. Methods The participants constituted laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-positive patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) features under home isolation or moderate to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) manifestations requiring admission. The chosen markers were analysed using the Human Luminex multiplex bead-based assay system. Results Our study revealed that certain markers, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and Galectin-3 were elevated in all COVID-19-positive patients, while others, like vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), Angiopoietin-2, Thrombomodulin, and tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) were specifically elevated in patients requiring admission. Such findings indicated the potential of some biomarkers in disease prognostication. Interpretation & conclusions Effective management of COVID-19 requires proper risk stratification. The findings of our investigation underscore the necessity for additional research to confirm the clinical utility and importance of these biomarkers and to fully leverage their capabilities in informing the management of severe COVID-19 disease.">

        <tr id="Background: The coronavirus–caused disease (COVID-19), first identified in China in December 2019, has spread worldwide becoming a global pandemic. Although people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus presented mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, an increase in cardiovascular incidents was observed in several scientific studies. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to disrupt the normal immune response leading to a dysregulation of immune system function and massive production of inflammatory cytokines commonly known as “cytokine storm”. Methods: 57 patients eventually participated in the study, assigned to non–COVID (24 patients) and COVID (33 patients) groups. After signing consent to participate in the study, each patient was given a self–administered questionnaire to fill out prior to specimen collection, anthropometric measurements were taken and venous blood was collected for the following determinations: pro- and anti–inflammatory cytokines using a Bio–Plex 200 system, oxidative stress markers and basic hematological blood parameters. Results: showed statistically significant higher values of IL–1Ra and IL–1β in the COVID-19 group. Of the oxidative stress markers, only MDA levels were higher in the COVID-19 group. Conclusions: the results of our study provide evidence and support the occurrence of elevated levels of IL–1Ra, IL–1β and MDA in the COVID-19 group of patients, which are associated with a worse course and prognosis of COVID-19. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and dysregulation of the immune system associated with the cytokine storm is essential to select patients at risk and develop effective drugs and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the most numerous immune cells of the lung and are the resident, sentinel lung immunocytes that summon trafficking immune cells to the compartment. Immune profiling of AMs from COVID-19 patients implicates AMs in the immune circuits that drive pulmonary inflammation in severe COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about human AM responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, such as the spike protein and envelope protein. We aimed to understand if human AMs recognize SARS-CoV-2 proteins and how they respond. We found that human AMs do not sense SARS-CoV-2 spike protein but do sense envelope protein via the pattern recognition receptors TLR2 and TLR4, secreting IL-1β, IFNγ, IL-12p70, IL-6, and TNFα in response. AMs from donors over the age of 70 years produced significantly more cytokines than those from younger patients following stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein. AMs from current smokers had lower cytokine secretion. This is the first report of human AMs producing cytokines in response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the first to correlate those responses with clinical risk factors. These results may partly explain why older adults are at such high risk of severe lung inflammation in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combination with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Little is known about the regulation of B cell subpopulations in association with programmed cell death during dengue virus (DENV) infection. Therefore, blood samples from dengue-infected patients and healthy donors were obtained for B cell subset characterization and the analysis of pro-apoptotic CD95 expression in these cell subsets. The results showed that the activated memory (AM) subset in the patients remained unchanged compared to the healthy donors. In contrast, tissue memory (TM) and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were notably increased, whereas naïve cells and resting memory (RM) cells were considerably decreased. Although the ASCs maintained comparably high levels of CD95 expression in both groups, significantly increased percentages of CD95-expressing cells in the other B cell subsets were found in the patients. When B cells from the healthy donors were treated with DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1), the results showed that the NS1 protein at 2 µg/mL could induce CD95 expression and the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane in most B cell subsets, except for the RM. This study demonstrates that DENV infection could induce CD95 expression in both activated and resting B cell subsets in all patients. The results also suggest a potential mechanism of apoptotic regulation in B cell subsets through the increased CD95 expression caused by the interaction between the B cells and the NS1 protein.">

        <tr id="Lassa fever is a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa. In the absence of efficient prophylactic or therapeutic countermeasures, it poses a substantial threat to public health in this region. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the severity of the disease are poorly known because Lassa virus (LASV), its causative agent, has to be handled in BSL-4 laboratories and access to clinical samples is difficult. The control of Lassa fever is associated with a rapid and well-balanced immune response and viral clearance. However, severe disease is characterized by uncontrolled innate immune activation and symptoms reminiscent of sepsis and a cytokine storm. In a model of cynomolgus monkeys infected with two different strains of the virus, one causing moderate disease and the other a lethal outcome, we show that the control of LASV infection is characterized by the induction of a LASV-specific T-cell response, whereas severity is associated with the expansion of suppressive myeloid cells, alterations of the stromal network of secondary lymphoid organs, and the anergy of specific T cells. These results suggest that T cells are crucial for the control of LASV and that immunomodulatory therapeutics, such as checkpoint inhibitors, could contribute to new therapeutic strategies to treat Lassa fever. They also highlight how immunosuppressive mechanisms described in sepsis and cancer patients may play a role in the pathogenicity of Lassa fever, as well as in other similar hemorrhagic fevers.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most patients recover fully after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2. Some, however, may develop pulmonary sequelae (PS) and/or long COVID (LC). However, whether these two clinical conditions have similar or different pathogenic mechanisms is unknown. Methods The levels of autoantibodies and 184 inflammatory and organ damage associated proteins in plasma were determined (by immunofluorescence and Olink panels, respectively) 1 year after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2 in 51 patients with PS (DLCO < 80% ref), 31 patients with LC and 31 patients fully recovered (Rec). PS was defined by the presence of reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) lower than 80% ref. LC was defined by the presence of chronic symptoms in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Results We found that patients with PS or LC both showed increased levels than Rec of anti-microbial, immune cell activation and recruitment related proteins. Patients with PS showed higher levels of anti-nuclear autoantibodies, whereas LC patients had increased levels of organ-damage associated proteins. In patients with PS most of the elevated proteins correlate with the impairment of lung function (DLCO). Finally, in PS we additionally performed the determinations at an earlier time point (6 months) and showed that the expression of CCL20 and IFN-ɣ was already higher at 6 months, while CCL3 and CCL19 increase from 6 to 12 months, suggesting a pathogenic role in PS persistence. Conclusions Patients with PS or LC have abnormal but different persistent circulatory immune and organ damage biomarkers, suggesting different underlying biology of both post-COVID conditions.

        <tr id="Background: Long COVID is characterized by persistent symptoms following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aims to evaluate immune system markers, including antigen-specific antibodies, B cell subsets, and Th2-related cytokines, in individuals with long COVID and to investigate their potential impact on the development of this condition. Methods: We analyzed blood plasma from 63 individuals diagnosed with long COVID based on clinical presentation and 47 healthy individuals with COVID-19 history but no clinical symptoms. Antigen-specific IgG antibodies were measured using commercial ELISA kits. Lymphocyte subpopulations were assessed via flow cytometry and a gating strategy based on CD27 and CD38. Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) were quantified using the xMAP multiplex assay. Results: We noted no significant differences in IgG levels between groups. Notably, individuals with long COVID demonstrated a higher percentage of naive mature B cells (CD27−CD38+), while transitional (CD27−CD38+++) and double-negative (DN, CD27−CD38-) cells were significantly reduced. Elevated levels of IL-5 and IL-13 were observed in long COVID patients. Classification analysis revealed that the percentage of transitional B cells (CD27−CD38+++) was a strong predictor of long COVID. Conclusions: Our findings highlight alterations in B cell dynamics among individuals with long COVID, which may contribute to autoimmune processes.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia globally and is characterised by reduced mitochondrial respiration and cortical deposition of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyper-phosphorylated tau. Despite its characterisation more than 110 years ago, the mechanisms by which AD develops are still unclear. Dysregulation of microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-β may play a key role. Microglia are the major innate immune cell of the central nervous system and are critical responders to pro-inflammatory states. Typically, microglia react with a short-lived inflammatory response. However, a dysregulation in the resolution of this microglial response results in the chronic release of inflammatory mediators. This prolongs the state of neuroinflammation, likely contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, the microglial specialised pro-resolving mediator (SPM) contribution to phagocytosis of amyloid-β is dysregulated in AD. SPMs are derivatives of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and potentially represent a strategic target for protection against AD progression. However, there is little understanding of how mitochondrial respiration in microglia may be sustained long term by n-3-derived SPMs, and how this affects their clearance of amyloid-β. Here, we re-evaluate the current literature on SPMs in AD and propose that SPMs may improve phagocytosis of amyloid-β by microglia as a result of sustained mitochondrial respiration and allowing a pro-resolution response.">

        <tr id="γδ T cells are a unique subset of unconventional T cells and an important component of the innate immune system. Unlike conventional αβ T cells, γδ T cells can respond rapidly during the early stages of infection, and their antigen recognition is not restricted by MHC molecules. These distinctive features underscore the important role of γδ T cells in viral clearance and infection control. Therefore, γδ T cell-based immunotherapies have been extensively explored for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including viral infections and cancers. Several therapeutic strategies based on γδ T cells have advanced to clinical trials, demonstrating promising safety and efficacy. Currently, there are no effective treatments for flavivirus infections, which are typically characterized by acute onset. Research has shown that γδ T cells can rapidly expand during the early phases of flavivirus infections and effectively suppress viral replication, making them an attractive target for the development of novel therapies for flavivirus infections. This review aims to highlight the immunological roles of γδ T cells in flavivirus infections and to explore the potential of γδ T cell-based therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of these infections.">

        <tr id="The immune characteristics and pathological mechanisms of COVID‐19 and tuberculosis coinfection are not well understood. Single‐cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting complex immune responses and cellular interactions in infectious diseases. Here, we employed scRNA‐seq, combined with laboratory examinations and clinical observations, to elucidate potential mechanisms of immunopathology and protective immunity in coinfected patients. Substantial alterations in immune cell populations in patients with severe coinfection were observed, characterized by severe lymphopenia and massive expansion of myeloid cells. Lymphocytopenia may have resulted from lymphocyte apoptosis and migration. Systemic upregulation of S100 family proteins, mainly released by classical monocytes, might contribute to inflammatory cytokine storm via S100‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway in severely coinfected patients. Myeloid cells may contribute to immune paralysis in severe cases through expansion of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and dysregulated dendritic cell function. The immune landscape of T cells in severe patients were featured by dysregulated Th1 response, widespread exhaustion and increased cytotoxic, apoptosis, migration and inflammatory states. We observed increased plasma cells and overexpression of B‐cell‐activation‐related pathways in severe patients. Together, we provide a comprehensive atlas illustrating the immune response to coinfected patients at the single‐cell resolution and highlight mechanisms of pathogenesis in severe patients.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence indicate that individual host immune response to pathogens may be as important as virulence factors in determining the severity of infection. However, most available data on pathogen-host interactions are based on in vitro findings, neglecting the genetic complexity of the immune response. We conducted a comparative observational study of bacterial and viral meningitis to identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent inflammatory pathways that may predict the severity of infection by analysing 54 inflammatory factors using plexing technology. Infection severity and neurological disability were assessed using the modified RANKIN scale. To identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent pathways, plex data were entered into EMBiology®™ software and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. We also investigated pathogen- and host-dependent regulatory effects on blood-brain barrier function using human iPSC-derived endothelial cells as a model. BBB function was characterised at the level of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), endothelial apoptosis and drug transporter activity. We identified 36 factors that are highly differentially regulated in either bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis compared to healthy subjects, 15 of which have not been previously described. GSEA identified previously unknown pathogen-specific pathways including neurotrophin, NOTCH, immune tolerance, antiviral defence and tight junction signalling. As a key finding, we identified 15 host-dependent factors that correlated with the grade of disability and with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. GSEA revealed stronger responses of neuroprotective (AKT/ERK), anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/p53) and anti-inflammatory (JAK1/STAT1) pathways in patients with favourable course, whereas patients with severe infection show stronger pro-inflammatory STAT-activation, NKC/CTL-responses and NFκ-B-associated neurotoxicity. BBB analysis supports these findings with dysregulation of TEER, drug transporter activity and induction of endothelial cell death in patients with severe infection. Our data highlight the need for future approaches to personalised medicine that go beyond traditional anti-infective therapy to target the individual immune response. Author Summery Infections often cause personal suffering, but also high economic costs. Brain infections such as bacterial or viral meningitis are particularly serious and carry a high risk of death or permanent disability. At the same time, resistance to anti-infective drugs is increasing and fewer new antibiotics are being developed. As a result, there is a great need for translational research to develop new treatments beyond conventional anti-infectives. Due to its strict compartmentalisation, the brain is well suited to identify specific pathogen-dependent, but also host (patient) dependent inflammatory patterns in infections. Using a cohort of patients with a defined group of pathogen-specific meningitis, we investigated the inflammatory patterns in the cerebrospinal fluid and were able to describe new specific pathogen-dependent and new host-dependent immune responses and identify associated signalling pathways. We were also able to show how and at what cellular and molecular level the blood-brain barrier is disrupted by infection. The degree of damage to the blood-brain barrier is an important aspect and has major implications for the course and prognosis of brain infections. Once the pathogen- and host-specific aspects of the immune response are understood, new personalised therapeutic approaches can be developed that directly target the regulation of the individual immune response.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a major global health crisis with widespread effects on healthcare, society, and economies. Initially seen as a respiratory illness, it is now recognized as a multisystem disease, with growing evidence of its impact on the nervous system. 
Neurological complications - such as cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), strokes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and mood disorders - have been reported in both severe and mild COVID-19 cases, highlighting the unpredictable nature of post-COVID sequelae. These symptoms can persist long after the acute phase of infection. 
The mechanisms behind these effects are complex and not yet fully understood. They include direct viral invasion of the central nervous system, immune dysregulation (e.g., cytokine storm, autoimmunity), and blood–brain barrier disruption, all of which may lead to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. 
The long-term neurological consequences pose significant clinical and societal challenges, requiring multidisciplinary care and tailored rehabilitation strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches, aiming to inform evidence-based post-COVID care.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis, highlighting the virus’s unique molecular mechanisms that distinguish it from other respiratory pathogens. It is known that the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α) activates a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways regulating cellular energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell survival, contributing to the wide range of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS). Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of HIF-1α is a key driver of systemic inflammation, silent hypoxia, and pathological tissue remodeling in both the acute and post-acute phases of the disease. This scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in INPLASY. It involved a literature search in Scopus and PubMed, supplemented by manual reference screening, with study selection facilitated by Rayyan software. Our analysis clarifies the dual role of HIF-1α, which may either worsen inflammatory responses and viral persistence or support adaptive mechanisms that reduce cellular damage. The potential for targeting HIF-1α therapeutically in COVID-19 is complex, requiring further investigation to clarify its precise role and translational applications. This review deepens the molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular and tissue dysfunction in hypoxia, offering insights for improving clinical management strategies and addressing long-term sequelae.">

In addition, c-ABL targeting attenuates F-actin reorganization induced by DENV infection. Together with the involvement of c-ABL in endothelial dysfunction induced by DENV and host secreted factors, our findings strongly suggest that c-ABL is a potential host-targeted antiviral that could control DENV infection and/or its evolution to more severe forms of the disease.">

        <tr id="Neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to the significant socioeconomic burden due to aging society, are gaining increasing interest. Despite each disease having different etiologies, neuroinflammation is believed to play a crucial role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition to the pathogenic function of inflammation in the brain there is growing evidence that immune responses are essential for neuroregeneration. This review compares and contrasts the neuroinflammatory pathways that selected neurodegenerative diseases share and have in common. In AD, tau tangles and beta-amyloid plaques cause microglia and astrocytes to become activated in an inflammatory response. Alpha-synuclein aggregation stimulate neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease, especially in the substantia nigra. In Multiple Sclerosis an autoimmune attack on myelin is connected to inflammation via invading immune cells. Commonalities include the release of pro-inflammatory mediators like cytokines and activation of signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK. Comprehending these common routes is essential for discovering early diagnostic possibilities for the diseases and possible tailored treatments. Our work underscores the potential for insights into disease mechanisms. Identifying common targets offers promise for advancing our understanding and potential future treatment approaches across these debilitating disorders.">

        <tr id="Objective To elucidate crucial immune cell subsets and associated immunological pathways by stratifying patients with immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) using immunophenotyping and transcriptomic approaches. Methods We conducted flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses in 23 immune cell subsets derived from 235 patients with six IMDs, using our database, utilizing our database, ImmuNexUT. Patients were stratified based on immunophenotyping data. Subsequently, we examined clinical and transcriptomic differences among these stratified clusters. Results Patients with IMDs were stratified into two clusters based on their immunophenotypes. Cluster 1 was enriched with differentiated B cells, including unswitched memory B cells (USM B), switched memory B cells, double-negative B cells and plasmablasts, while cluster 2 was enriched with naïve B cells. Higher disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and decreased respiratory functions in systemic sclerosis were observed in cluster 1, whereas the disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus was higher in cluster 2. Numerous differentially expressed genes were detected in USM B. Cluster 1 was associated with glycosylation processes in USM B and elevated B cell-activating factor signalling from myeloid cells in B cells, while cluster 2 exhibited higher B-cell receptor signalling in USM B. Patients in cluster 2, which had an elevated age-associated B-cell signature, exhibited more frequent flares, suggesting that an increased proportion of naïve B cells with this signature is associated with poor prognosis. Conclusion Immunophenotyping-based clusters and transcriptome-based states revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in B cells. To predict IMD prognosis, assessing both the quantity and quality of naïve B cells may be crucial.">

        <tr id="The immune response to virus infection in the respiratory tract must be carefully balanced to achieve pathogen clearance without excessive immunopathology. For chronic respiratory diseases where there is ongoing inflammation, such as in asthma and COPD, airway immune balance is perturbed, and viral infection frequently worsens (exacerbates) these conditions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical to the induction and propagation of inflammation, and when appropriately regulated, ROS are vital cell signalling molecules and contribute to innate immunity. However, extended periods of high ROS concentration can cause excessive cellular damage that dysregulates antiviral immunity and promotes inflammation. Traditional antioxidant therapeutics have had limited success treating inflammatory diseases such as viral exacerbations of asthma or COPD, owing to nonspecific pharmacology and poorly understood pharmacokinetic properties. These drawbacks could be addressed with novel drug delivery technologies and pharmacological agents. This review summarises current research on ROS imbalances during virus infection, discusses the commercially available mitochondrial antioxidant drugs that have progressed to clinical trial and assesses novel drug delivery approaches for antioxidant delivery to the airways. Additionally, it provides a perspective on future research into pharmacological targeting of ROS for the treatment of respiratory virus infection and disease.">

        <tr id="Introduction. It is now known that 30% of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 develop long-COVID. According to researchers, the reactivation of herpesviruses plays a significant role in triggering long-COVID. In these patients, alteration in lymphocyte populations and T-lymphocyte subpopulations have been observed, yet the nature of these changes remains unclear. The dysregulation of the immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 is further exacerbated by the reactivation of human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6). Therefore, it is essential to distinguish immune response alterations in long-COVID patients based on HHV-6 reactivation and consider these differences when developing therapeutic approaches. 
The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the associative relationships between the number of lymphocyte populations, T-lymphocyte subpopulations, and the severity of the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with long-COVID; 2) to determine and compare the percentages of CD3+, CD4+, CD56+, CD8+, CD4/25/127– T-regs and CD19+ cells in long-COVID patients depending on the presence of reactivated HHV-6. 
Materials and methods. In our study, we examined 124 patients, including 73 women (59%) and 51 men (41%), with an average age of 43±9.70 years, all of whom had suffered from COVID-19 in the second half of 2023. To confirm HHV-6 reactivation and form study groups, molecular genetic studies (PCR) were conducted on all patients. Subsequently, flow cytometry was used to analyze the lymphocyte populations and subpopulations in peripheral blood samples from the patients. 
Results. In patients with long-COVID following severe COVID-19, the percentage of CD3+ T cells, CD8+ cells, and CD4+CD25+CD127– T-regs was significantly lower both in the absence of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.014; p=0.016; p=0.045, respectively) and during the active phase of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.045; p=0.005; p=0.008, respectively), compared to the control group. CD4+ T cells were significantly decreased only during the active phase of the herpesvirus (p=0.045). Notably, in the active phase of HHV-6, these cells were further reduced compared to those without herpesvirus reactivation. Additionally, the number of CD19+ B cells was significantly elevated in patients with HHV-6 reactivation, compared to both the control group (p<0.0001) and patients without HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.0002). Furthermore, the percentage of CD56+ NK cells in patients with long- COVID following mild and moderate COVID-19 in the history, without HHV-6 reactivation, did not differ significantly from the control group. However, NK cells were significantly lower in patients with long-COVID after severe COVID-19 in the context of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.0001). 
Conclusions. Our data confirm that HHV-6 reactivation after COVID-19 plays a role in the development of long-COVID. This is mediated through dysregulation of adaptive immune cell interactions, activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and increased production of antibodies with defective structure. Based on our results, patients with long- COVID following severe COVID-19, in the context of HHV-6 reactivation, may have an elevated risk of immunopathological complications, potentially including autoimmune disorders. These findings offer valuable insights for future research and potential therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="After peripheral infections, the initial accumulation of prions within secondary lymphoid tissues is essential for the transmission of disease to the brain. Macrophages are considered to sequester or destroy prions, but little was known of their impact on disease susceptibility after a peripheral infection. Inflammation in the peritoneal cavity can trigger the macrophage disappearance reaction, whereby the macrophages are temporarily contained within cellular aggregates on the mesothelium. We studied the impact of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated macrophage disappearance reaction on susceptibility to an intraperitoneal prion infection. Intraperitoneal LPS injection significantly enhanced prion disease susceptibility approximately 100X when given 24–3 h before infection. The effects on disease susceptibility coincided with the reduced abundance of macrophages within the peritoneal cavity at the time of infection and the enhanced early accumulation of prions in the spleen. This suggests that the reduced recoverable abundance of macrophages in the peritoneal cavity following acute LPS-treatment, increased disease susceptibility by enhancing the initial propagation of the prions from site of exposure (peritoneal cavity) to the spleen from where they subsequently spread to the brain. Further studies may help identify novel macrophage-targeted treatments that can reduce susceptibility to peripherally acquired prion infections.">

        <tr id="S100A4 participates in inflammation and immune reactions in the central nervous system and is involved in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological disorders. It can affect the functions of astrocytes, microglia, infiltrating cells and neurons and further modulates neuronal plasticity and survival in the central nervous system. However, its impact on astrocyte phenotypes and neuropathic pain and the intrinsic mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that S100A4 was markedly upregulated after spinal nerve ligation and was mainly expressed in neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Transcriptional inhibition of S100A4 with niclosamide attenuated neuropathic pain after surgery. We found that astrocytes differentiated into C3-positive reactive populations, so-called neurotoxic (A1) astrocytes and identified differentially expressed genes and specific molecular expression signatures after ligation. Neurotoxic astrocyte reactivity is regulated by exogenous S100A4 in vitro, and targeted inhibition of S100A4 suppresses neurotoxic astrocyte proliferation in rats. Finally, we reported that TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway is a downstream of S100A4 activation, and that specific depletion this pathway suppresses deleterious A1 astrocyte activation and further attenuates the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain after spinal nerve ligation. Thus, S100A4 in neurons plays a key role in neurotoxic astrocyte reactivity and can be targeted for treatment to prevent and alleviate neuropathic pain.

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, recent findings indicate that it also significantly disrupts the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, contributing to disease severity, systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections and chronic conditions. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, exacerbates the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and has been linked to long-COVID, a condition affecting a significant proportion of survivors and manifesting with over 200 symptoms across multiple organ systems. Despite the growing recognition of microbiome alterations in COVID-19, the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the microbiome and influences disease progression remain poorly understood. This narrative review investigates the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host-microbiota dynamics and evaluates its implications in disease severity and for developing personalized therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Furthermore, it highlights the dual role of the microbiome in modulating disease progression, and as a promising target for advancing diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches in managing COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is still a burden for healthcare systems worldwide. Now, the focus is not only on acute infections, but also on the long-term effects of COVID-19. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the cardiovascular system, and determine the evolution of these changes over 6 months in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19. Methods: The prospective observational study included 103 patients with mild and moderate COVID-19. The patients underwent an echocardiography and a measurement of the arterial stiffness parameters at baseline and 6 months from the initial assessment. Results: The diastolic dysfunction (the left atrium volume) was statistically significant at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up in men with moderate COVID-19. The ejection fraction presented significant differences globally in mild versus moderate COVID-19 (p=0.043) that disappeared at 6-month follow-up. Global longitudinal strain alterations were also found in both mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. Regarding the aortic pulse wave velocity, the SARS-CoV-2 infection did not influence the arterial stiffness. Ventricular arterial coupling was significantly altered in moderate COVID-19 at the 6-month evaluation (p=0.0218). Male patients presented a lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion at baseline. Right ventricular systolic dysfunction was more frequent among men. Systolic pulmonary arterial pressure increased significantly only in men with moderate disease. Additionally, statistically significant changes at baseline and at 6 months were found regarding the intima-media thickness. Conclusion: This study shows the cardiovascular long-term sequelae associated with COVID-19 in mild and moderate cases, and emphasises the appropriate investigations for their diagnosis and follow-up.">

        <tr id="An overly exuberant immune response, characterized by a cytokine storm and uncontrolled inflammation, has been identified as a significant driver of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Consequently, deciphering the intricacies of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 is imperative to identify specific targets for intervention and modulation. With these delicate dynamics in mind, immunomodulatory therapies have emerged as a promising avenue for mitigating the challenges posed by COVID-19. Precision in manipulating immune pathways presents an opportunity to alter the host response, optimizing antiviral defenses while curbing deleterious inflammation. This review article comprehensively analyzes immunomodulatory interventions in managing COVID-19. We explore diverse approaches to mitigating the hyperactive immune response and its impact, from corticosteroids and non-steroidal drugs to targeted biologics, including anti-viral drugs, cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, cell-based therapies (i.e., CAR T, etc.). By summarizing the current evidence, we aim to provide a clear roadmap for clinicians and researchers navigating the complex landscape of immunomodulation in COVID-19 treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction Accumulating evidence indicates that the increased presence of astrocytes is fundamentally linked to the neurological dysfunctions observed in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor), as a chromatin modifier, regulates 15,450 genes in humans. REST is a key regulatory element that governs astrocyte differentiation, development, and the maintenance of their physiological functions. The downregulation of REST may disrupt the homeostatic balance of astrocytes in DS. Methods This study aims to elucidate the role of REST in DS-astrocytes through comprehensive transcriptomic analysis and experimental validation. Results Transcriptomic analysis identified that REST-targeted differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DS astrocytes are enriched in pathways associated with inflammatory response. Notably, our findings in astrocytes derived from DS human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) show that the loss of nucleus REST leads to an upregulation of inflammatory mediators and markers indicative of the presence of reactive astrocytes. Lithium treatment, which restored nucleus REST in trisomic astrocytes, significantly suppressed the expression of these inflammatory mediators and reactive astrocyte markers. Discussion These findings suggest that REST is pivotal in modulating astrocyte functionality and reactivity in DS. The loss of REST in DS-astrocytes prompts the formation of reactive astrocytes, thereby compromising central nervous system homeostasis. Lithium treatment possesses the potential to rescue astrocyte reactivity in DS by restoring nucleus REST expression.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is a potentially deadly superinfection in patients with influenza pneumonia, especially those with severe disease, underlying immunosuppression, corticosteroid therapy, or requiring intensive care support. Given the high mortality of IAPA, adjunct immunomodulatory strategies remain a critical unmet need. Previously, the desensitization of pattern recognition pathways has been described as a hallmark of IAPA pathogenesis and a predictor of mortality in IAPA patients. Therefore, we studied the impact of nebulized Toll-like receptor 2/6/9 agonists Pam2 CSK4 (Pam2) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) on infection outcomes and pulmonary immunopathology in a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed murine IAPA model. Mice with IAPA receiving mock therapy showed rapidly progressing disease and a paralyzed immune response to secondary Aspergillus fumigatus infection. Nebulized Pam2ODN was well tolerated and significantly prolonged event-free survival. Specifically, dual-dose Pam2ODN therapy before and after A. fumigatus infection led to 81% survival and full recovery of all survivors. Additionally, transcriptional analysis of lung tissue homogenates revealed induction of pattern recognition receptor signaling and several key effector cytokine pathways after Pam2ODN therapy. Moreover, transcriptional and flow cytometric analyses suggested increased frequencies of macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells in the lungs of Pam2ODN-treated mice. Collectively, immunomodulatory treatment with nebulized Pam2ODN strongly improved morbidity and mortality outcomes and alleviated paralyzed antifungal immunity in an otherwise lethal IAPA model. These findings suggest that Pam2ODN might be a promising candidate for locally delivered immunomodulatory therapy to improve outcomes of virus-associated mold infections such as IAPA. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significant healthcare burden, morbidity, and mortality caused by secondary fungal pneumonias. Given the heightened prevalence of severe viral pneumonias, such as influenza, and poor outcomes of secondary mold pneumonias, adjunct immunotherapies are needed to prevent and treat secondary infections. We herein demonstrate severely paralyzed immunity to secondary Aspergillus fumigatus infection in a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mouse model of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA), partially due to dysregulated pathogen-sensing pathways. To overcome immune paralysis and IAPA progression, we used a dyad of nebulized immunomodulators (Toll-like receptor agonists). Nebulized immunotherapy significantly improved morbidity and mortality compared to mock therapy, increased frequencies of mature mononuclear phagocytes and natural killer cells in the lung, and stimulated antimicrobial signaling. Collectively, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of locally delivered immunomodulatory therapy to alleviate virus-induced immune dysregulation in the lung and improve outcomes of post-viral mold pneumonias such as IAPA.

        <tr id="A mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 invaded the human nervous system. This was confirmed by an increase in biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of COVID-19 patients. To confirm the neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV-2, a series of analyses were conducted utilizing accessible datasets by MR. In addition, external validation was conducted by testing specific proteins in a retrospective cohort study, which included 40 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications and 15 disease controls (DC). Our investigation revealed the hospitalization, severity of COVID-19 increased the area and volume of certain brain regions, but no other significant causal effects were found of brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) on COVID-19. Notably, the COVID-19 hospitalization significantly increased the area and volume of the left caudal middle frontal gyrus (p_fdr = 0.012; p_fdr = 0.012, respectively). Additionally, COVID-19 severity was linked to the area, volume of the right caudal anterior-cingulate cortex and the volume of the right cuneus cortex (p_fdr = 0.023; p_fdr = 0.025; p_fdr = 0.026, respectively). In the CSF of COVID-19 patients, the median level of CHI3L1 was significantly higher (13677 pg/mL) compared to the DC group (8421 pg/mL, p < 1.00E-04). Similar trends were also found in CSF KLK6 and NGF-β. Additionally, the median NRGN level in plasma was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (1013.00 pg/mL) compared to the control group (360.00 pg/mL, p = 6.50E-03). A subgroup analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 patients experiencing moderate to critical symptoms exhibited higher levels of GFAP in their CSF compared to those without. Elevated CSF levels of GFAP and S100B were also found in COVID-19 patients with decreased consciousness and comorbidities. This MR analysis provided evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may invade the human nervous system, as indicated by the increased levels of CSF biomarkers CHI3L1, NGF-β, and KLK6 in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggested that neuroinflammation could be a potential mechanism underlying the neurological complications seen in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Hypertension-related Depression (HD) is a complex mental disorder that exerts a significant negative impact on patients’ quality of life. Previous studies have demonstrated that damages to vascular endothelial and hippocampus are the primary pathological features in HD rats. Under hypertensive conditions, inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood vessels can induce central nervous system inflammation through penetration of a damaged blood-brain barrier, peripheral immune cells, and neural pathways, damaging the brain and triggering HD. Therefore, interactions between vascular endothelial cells, neurons, and glial cells are critical for the understanding of HD. However, in vivo animal models are often limited by the complexity of intrinsic systems, high inter-individual variability, and stringent ethical regulations. A reliable model that could be easily manipulated is needed for investigating the mechanisms involved in communication between vascular endothelial cells, neurons, and glial cells in HD. We therefore aimed to create a composite tri-culture model consisting of rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs), neurons, and microglia to study HD. First, RAECs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide to mimic endothelial injury under hypertensive conditions. Vascular endothelial function and inflammatory levels were assessed using fluorescent probes and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RAECs treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 24 h had reduced levels of nitric oxide, increased levels of endothelin-1 and inflammatory mediators. These findings are consistent with the endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory responses observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats, which suggests that the lipopolysaccharide-induced RAECs model effectively mimics key pathological features of hypertension-related endothelial injury. Subsequently, the supernatants from lipopolysaccharide-induced RAECs were combined with 200 μM corticosterone and transferred to neuron-microglia co-cultures to simulate damages to hippocampal neuron under HD conditions. To evaluate the features of cells, neuronal viability was measured by CCK-8 and live-dead assays. Nissl staining was used to assess neuronal Nissl bodies, while the levels of inflammatory factors and monoamine neurotransmitters in the culture supernatants were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Reactive oxygen species in neurons were visualized by a fluorescent probe, apoptosis was detected using TUNEL assays, and immunofluorescence was used to assess microglial phenotypes and the levels of TLR4 and NF-κB. It was found that neurons in the tri-culture model had reduced viability, higher levels of apoptosis, fewer Nissl bodies, increased inflammation, and reduced levels of monoamine neurotransmitters. Additionally, the number of M1 microglia was increased, along with elevated levels of TLR4 and NF-κB proteins. These findings were similar to damages of hippocampal neuron, abnormal levels of monoamine neurotransmitters, microglia polarization, and hippocampal inflammatory response observed in the HD rat model. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the tri-culture model can effectively simulate the pathological characteristics of HD, especially in vascular endothelial damage, neuroinflammation, monoamine neurotransmitters disorders. Therefore, the tri-culture model would provides a reliable and invaluable experimental tool for further research on the pathogenesis and treatment of HD.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background: Pathological inflammation with a loss of synaptic integrity and function has been implicated in HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Although therapeutics exist to increase the lifespan of people living with HIV (PLWH), they are not effective at preventing neuroinflammation and HIV induced neuronal damage persists. In this study, we investigate the ephrin-B/EphB axis, which regulates inflammation, in post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and experimental models in order to assess its potential role in HIV induced neuroinflammation. Methods: We analyze mRNA samples of post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and uninfected controls obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) and, for comparison, of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Follow-up experiments employ mouse brain tissue and in vitro models, including immortalized human microglia, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mixed neuroglial cell cultures, cellular and molecular interference, functional and multiplex assays, immunofluorescence and mRNA sequencing to examine the role of the ephrin-B/EphB axis in neuroinflammation and the associated neurotoxicity. Results: Using qRT-PCR we find increased expression of EphB2 in post-mortem brain of PLWH, and detect a correlation with pro-viral DNA, viral RNA and an inverse correlation with abstract executive function and verbal fluency. Increased expression of ephrin-B/EphB at mRNA and protein level is also observed in brains of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV suggesting the upregulation can be driven, at least in part, by expression of viral gp120 envelope protein and a type I interferon, IFNβ. Additionally, we find induction of ephrin-B1 expression in microglia following activation by IFNβ. Given the previously reported impact of EphB2 on inflammation in the periphery, the functional role of EphB2-mediated ephrin-B reverse signaling on microglia is assessed for a pro-inflammatory and anti-viral signature. We find that EphB2 treated microglia secrete inflammatory and anti-viral factors but also exert contact-independent neurotoxicity. Finally, knockdown of microglial ephrin-B1, an EphB2 binding partner, shows a partial alleviation of the microglial pro-inflammatory signature and neurotoxicity. Conclusion: Our study suggests that elevated EphB2, and its reverse signaling through ephrin-B1 in microglia contribute to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in neuroHIV.">

        <tr id="Introduction Individuals suffering from acute COVID-19 (AC) often develop long COVID-19 (LC) syndrome that is associated with aberrant levels of lipoproteins and inflammatory mediators. Yet, these dysregulations are heterogenous due to the uncertain prevalence and require a more extensive characterization. Objectives This study aimed to investigate LC-associated dysregulations in inflammatory mediators and lipids by longitudinal Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) lipoprotein analysis and cytokine profiling in human blood. Methods We quantitatively profiled lipoproteins and inflammatory parameters in LC patients at 5 (n = 95), 9 (n = 73), 12 (n = 95), 16 (n = 78), and 20 (n = 85) months post AC by in vitro diagnostics research (IVDr)-based NMR spectroscopy. Simultaneously, we assessed inflammatory meditators with a 13-plex cytokine panel by flow cytometry. We then compared the lipoprotein profiles with historical data from AC (N = 307) and healthy cohorts collected before the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 305), whereas the cytokine profiles were correlated with that of the AC cohort. Results We identified 31 main and 80 significantly altered subclass lipoproteins, respectively. LC was associated with higher serum levels of very low-density, intermediate-density, low-density, high-density lipoproteins, along with triglycerides, cholesterols, and apolipoprotein a-I & a-II lipoproteins compared to the healthy cohort. We also observed significantly lower concentrations of NMR-based inflammatory parameters in LC than in AC cohort, whilst proinflammatory mediators IFN-α2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-17 A, and IL-23 displayed significantly higher concentrations in LC compared with the AC cohort. Conversely, CCL2/MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-18 were significantly higher in the AC cohort than in LC. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a persistent hyperlipidemic phenotype in LC alongside signs of chronic inflammation and lipoprotein metabolism that vary in states of acute and chronic inflammation.

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 with devastating effects on health-care systems. The magnitude of the problem has moved physicians and investigators to identify strategies to detect patients at a high risk of severe disease. The aim of this study was to identify the most relevant biomarkers in the published literature and their correlation with clinical outcomes. To this end, we performed a revision of studies that investigated laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-19, comparing non-severe and severe patients. Blood biomarkers were classified into five main categories: hematological, coagulation related to the liver or kidney, and inflammatory. From our analysis, the most relevant biomarkers associated with severe infection for each category were increased levels of leukocytes, neutrophils, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; decreased platelet count; and high levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, creatine kinase, troponin, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and IL-6. Moreover, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer levels were independent risk factors for death.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND The severe respiratory manifestations observed in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases are often associated with an excessive inflammatory response. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and suppressing the activity of various immune cells. This mechanism has implications for mitigating the cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 cases. Early on in the pandemic, the Recovery Collaborative working group showed a mortality benefit of using dexamethasone in decreasing mortality in patients with COVID-19 requiring respiratory support. However, the optimal dosage of corticosteroids remains debatable. Several studies that compare different doses of dexamethasone in COVID-19 exist, but the results are conflicting. AIM To review the latest evidence regarding dosage, safety, and efficacy of dexamethasone in severe COVID-19. METHODS We followed preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. A detailed literature search was conducted across PubMed, Google Scholar, and Medline to include publications up to March 2024. Our keywords included “COVID-19” “SARS-CoV-2” “dexamethasone” “corticosteroid” “steroid” and “glucocorticoid”-along with their combinations. We employed the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to evaluate the integrity and potential of bias in the included studies. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, assessing pooled odds ratios and mean differences, with heterogeneity gauged by the I2 statistic and the χ2 tests. RESULTS No statistical differences were found in 28-day all-cause mortality [pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.109, 95%CI: 0.918-1.340], 60-day all-cause mortality (OR = 0.873, 95%CI: 0.744-1.024; I2 = 47.29%), mean length of hospital stay (mean difference = -0.08 days, 95%CI: -0.001 to 0.161) and adverse events (OR = 0.877, 95%CI: 0.707-1.087). CONCLUSION Differing doses of corticosteroids have no clinical implications on mortality, mean length of hospital stay, and adverse events in COVID-19 patients. Additional research is required in patients requiring invasive or non-invasive ventilation.">

        <tr id="Background Stroke, encompassing both ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes, is a leading cause of mortality and disability globally and current treatments remain limited. Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of stroke, influencing both acute injury and long-term recovery. Objective This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of neuroinflammation in stroke, detailing the mechanisms, clinical implications, and potential therapeutic strategies. Methods A detailed literature review was conducted, focusing on recent advancements in understanding the neuroinflammatory processes in stroke, including the roles of thromboinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and the immune response. Results The initial ischemic insult triggers an inflammatory cascade involving both innate and adaptive immune responses. BBB disruption allows peripheral immune cells and neurotoxic substances to infiltrate the brain, exacerbating neuronal damage and increasing the risk of infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Thromboinflammation, characterized by platelet activation and immune cell interactions, further complicates the ischemic environment. Proteomic studies have identified key biomarkers that offer insights into neuroinflammatory mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Advances in imaging techniques, such as PET and MRI, enable real-time monitoring of neuroinflammation, facilitating personalized treatment approaches. Conclusion Neuroinflammation significantly impacts stroke outcomes, presenting both challenges and opportunities for treatment. Current immunologic therapeutic strategies are limited. Future research should aim to further elucidate the complex immune interactions in stroke, refine imaging biomarkers for clinical use, and develop effective interventions to mitigate neuroinflammation.">

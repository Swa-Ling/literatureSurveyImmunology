        <tr id="The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has threatened human health worldwide. Among protective immune reactions, T cell responses are diverse among individuals, which is related to the differences in severity. A T cell subset, regulatory T (Treg) cells, is crucial for limiting excessive immune responses. If SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs are developed during infection, they may counteract anti-viral immunity and cause severe symptom. To address this possibility, we conducted single-cell TCR-RNA-sequencing of PBMCs from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Among thirteen donors, one with severe symptom had substantially more FOXP3-expressing Treg clonotypes activated in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virion or other major antigen proteins. To define the reactivity of these Treg clonotypes, fifteen highly expanded Treg clonotypes were reconstituted into reporter cells and stimulated with 27 distinct peptide pools that cover all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However, none of these clonotypes react to any SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Instead, the reporter cells expressing one TCR clonotype (23599) were activated in the presence of EBV-transformed B cells without adding exogenous antigens. Furthermore, 23599 TCR-expressing cells were activated by non-transformed naïve syngenic B cells in DQA1*03:03-DQB1*04:01-dependent manner, suggesting that clonotype 23599 may be autoreactive. This Treg clonotype, 23599, was also detected in a public TCR database, and significantly expanded in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not the dominant antigen inducing Treg during infection.">

        <tr id="Severity of COVID-19 is affected by multiple factors; however, it is not understood how the inflammatory milieu of the lung at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure affects the control of viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that immune events in the mouse lung closely preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection affect viral control and identify innate immune pathways that limit viral replication. Pulmonary inflammatory stimuli including resolved, antecedent respiratory infections with Staphylococcus aureus or influenza, ongoing pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, ovalbumin/alum-induced asthma, or airway administration of TLR ligands and recombinant cytokines all establish an antiviral state in the lung that restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to antiviral type I interferons, TNFα and IL-1 potently precondition the lung for enhanced viral control. Our work shows that SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from an immunologically quiescent lung microenvironment and suggests that heterogeneity in pulmonary inflammation preceding SARS-CoV-2 exposure may contribute to variability in disease outcomes.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains endemic worldwide. Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B and T lymphocytes in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="It is important to be able to retrospectively determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections with high accuracy, both for post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiological studies, and to distinguish between Long COVID and other multi-syndromic diseases that have overlapping symptoms. Although serum antibody levels can be measured to retrospectively diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, peptide stimulation of memory T cell responses is a more sensitive approach. This is because robust memory T cells are generated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and persist even after antibodies wane below detectability thresholds. In this study, we compare T cell responses using FluoroSpot-based methods and overnight stimulation of whole blood with SARS-CoV-2 peptides followed by an ELISA. Both approaches have comparable sensitivity and specificity but require different equipment and samples to be used. Furthermore, the elimination of peptides that cross-react with other coronaviruses increases the assay specificity but trades off some sensitivity. Finally, this approach can be used on archival, cryopreserved PBMCs. This work shows comparative advantages for several methods to measure SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses that could be utilized by any laboratory studying the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.">

        <tr id="Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has been the most severe public health emergency since 2019. Currently, the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the most dominant. The most prominent symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory. Meanwhile, the fatality of COVID-19 was mainly from pneumonia. However ,in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have pneumonia and those who do not, the differences in the immune repertoire still require further investigation. Methods We conducted seven-chain adaptome immune repertoire analyses on patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, both with and without pulmonary infiltration. Results Patients with pulmonary infiltration exhibit lymphopenia, a decreased proportion of the overall TCR repertoire alongside an increased BCR repertoire, reduced IGHD and IGHM isotype expression, a shorter mean CDR3 length for TRG, and a longer mean length for TRD, as well as diminished clonality and diversity in the TCR/BCR repertoire. Meanwhile, patients with pulmonary infiltration have distinct V-J gene usage and unique CDR3 signature, as well as BCR class switch recombination pattern. Finally, prior vaccination triggered less BCR IGHM/IGHD somatic hypermutation response, preserved the diversity of the entire adaptive immune repertoire, and provided clinical protection against severe or critical conditions following Omicron infection. Discussion We report a unique, comprehensive adaptive immune system signature in patients with pulmonary infiltration, which may serve as potential immunological biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

Coronavirus interactions with host innate immune antiviral responses are an important determinant of disease outcome. This review compares the host's innate response to different human coronaviruses. Host antiviral defenses discussed in this review include frontline defenses against respiratory viruses in the nasal epithelium, early sensing of viral infection by innate immune effectors, double-stranded RNA and stress-induced antiviral pathways, and viral antagonism of innate immune responses conferred by conserved coronavirus nonstructural proteins and genus-specific accessory proteins. The common cold coronaviruses HCoV-229E and -NL63 induce robust interferon signaling and related innate immune pathways, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 induce intermediate levels of activation, and MERS-CoV shuts down these pathways almost completely.">

Despite the presence of infection- and vaccine-induced immunity, SARS-CoV-2 infections remain a major global health concern because of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that can cause severe acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or enhance Long Covid disease phenotypes. About 5 to 10% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop Long Covid, which, similar to acute COVID 19, often affects the lung. However, Long Covid can also affect other peripheral organs, especially the brain. The causal relationships between acute disease phenotypes, long-term symptoms, and involvement of multiple organ systems remain elusive, and animal model systems mimicking both acute and post-acute phases are imperative. Here, we review the current state of Long Covid animal models, including current and possible future applications.">

        <tr id="Abstract As the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus continues to evolve and infect the global population, many individuals are likely to suffer from post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Manifestations of PASC include vision symptoms, but little is known about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and impact the retinal cells. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and perturb the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in vivo, after intranasal inoculation of a transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in cell culture. Separate lentiviral studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mediates viral entry and replication in RPE cells, while the Envelope and ORF3a proteins induce morphological changes. Infection with major variants of SARS-CoV-2 compromised the RPE barrier function and phagocytic capacity. It also caused complement activation and production of cytokines and chemokines, resulting in an inflammatory response that spread across the RPE layer. This inflammatory signature has similarities to that associated with the onset of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of human blindness, resulting from RPE pathology that eventually leads to photoreceptor cell loss. Thus, our findings suggest that post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the RPE may have long-term implications for vision, perhaps comparable to the increased occurrence of AMD found among individuals infected by HIV, but with greater public health consequences due to the much larger number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in over 7 million confirmed deaths. In addition to severe respiratory and systematic symptoms, several comorbidities increase the risk of fatal outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing conditions in patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. Recent clinical studies have reported the reactivation of human herpesviruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), in severe COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. To support these clinical observations, we established a KSHV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection system in A549-hACE2 cells. Our findings indicate that co-infection with live SARS-CoV-2 sharply induces KSHV lytic reactivation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in global cellular gene expression in KSHV-infected A549-hACE2 cells, both with and without SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. These data provide a molecular basis for understanding whether patients with pre-existing oncogenic herpesvirus infections are at increased risk for more severe COVID-19 or for developing virus-associated cancers even after full recovery from COVID-19.">

        <tr id="It has been reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can result in long-term neurological symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, however the specific mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Initially, we confirmed a reduction in the level of synaptic proteins in SH-SY5Y neurons following SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 Nsps are crucial for the efficient replication of the virus and play important roles in the interaction between virus and host cell. Nsps screening experiments implied that Nsp7 is able to reduce the level of synapsin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Nsp7 in SH-SY5Y cells and mouse primary neurons demonstrated that Nsp7 could decrease the levels of synaptic proteins without affecting neuronal viability. Moreover, C57BL/6 mice receiving AAV-GFP-Nsp7 injections into the ventral hippocampus displayed impaired memory ability, along with reduced dendritic spine density and synaptic protein levels. Mechanistic investigations suggested that Nsp7-induced mitochondrial damage led to ROS production and ATP levels decreasing in neurons. Additional experiments employing the ROS inhibitor NAC demonstrated that Nsp7 suppressed the expression of synaptic proteins via ROS inducing, implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in synaptic plasticity impairment and subsequent cognitive dysfunction. Our findings underscore the crucial role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7 in cognitive dysfunction, which is potentially mediated through impaired synaptic plasticity via mitochondrial damage. This study enhances our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying central nervous system-related symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background To date, it is still not clear why during the COVID-19 pandemic children generally developed no or milder symptoms compared to adults. As innate immune responses are crucial in the early defense against pathogens, we aimed at profiling these responses from both adults and children with a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In the first months of the pandemic, PBMCs and serum were collected from peripheral blood of adults and children at different time points after testing SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive (PCR+). The levels of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific IgG were measured in serum. The cells were cultured for 24 hours in medium only, with heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (iSARS-CoV-2) or toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. The levels of secreted cytokines/chemokines as well as monocyte phenotype were determined. Results Few days after testing PCR+, PBMCs from PCR+ children secreted higher levels of cytokines/chemokines compared to PCR+ adults, after these cells were incubated either in medium only or after stimulation with iSARS-CoV-2 or TLR ligands. Furthermore, PBMCs from children stimulated with iSARS-CoV-2 secreted significantly higher levels of IL-10 and GM-CSF compared to PBMCs from control children. In contrast, PBMCs from the PCR+ adults secreted lower levels of IL-8 compared to adult controls. Phenotypic analysis of monocytes indicates a smaller proportion non-classical monocytes for adults compared to children. The distinct cytokine profiles, symptom severity, and the proportion of non-classical monocytes correlated to each other. The levels of Spike-specific IgG overtime did not significantly differ between children and adults. Conclusions Within the first week after testing PCR+, children showed a stronger inflammatory innate immune profile and experienced less severe symptoms compared to adults. Our data implies correlations between the secretion of cytokines/chemokines, proportion of non-classical monocytes, and symptoms severity. These findings enhance our understanding of the distinct pediatric and adult innate immune profile after SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes to the knowledge necessary to improve future prevention strategies.">

Cambogin, a bioactive natural product, has been shown to effectively induce regression of KSHV-latently infected tumours in xenograft mice models; however, its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Here, we report that Cambogin targets 46 host genes commonly affected by both SARS-CoV-2 and KSHV infections, as identified through bioinformatics analysis. These genes are related with 14 key upstream signalling pathways, particularly those involved in inflammation regulation, protein phosphorylation, metabolic processes, and cellular stress response. Within the transcriptional factor (TF)-miRNA co-regulatory network, ten out of 46 hub-target genes are closely linked to Cambogin and KSHV/SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, Cambogin not only efficiently blocks the replication and virion production of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo by reducing the expression of EGFR and Cyclin A2, but also simultaneously inhibits both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the growth of KSHV-induced tumours in vivo using a murine xenograft model. These findings provide an alternative strategy for the potential use of Cambogin in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients, particularly those with KSHV co-infection.">

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is characterized by persistent symptoms following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and has emerged as a significant health concern. As SARS‐CoV‐2 evolved from the wild‐type strain to the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants, there may be a variant‐specific influence on long COVID akin to the acute disease. This review aims to summarize our current knowledge of variant‐specific influences in long COVID incidence, symptom profile as well as mechanisms of pathogenesis. We highlight that long COVID incidence may be lower with the Omicron variants. The symptom profile of long COVID may also show some dependence on the different variants, with a reduction in cardiopulmonary symptoms with more recent SARS‐CoV‐2 variants. This heterogeneity of long COVID may also be related to the variant‐specific differences in affecting the immune system, viral persistence, and autoimmunity. However, emerging data also suggest that vaccinations may play a big role in shaping the presentation of long COVID. We also highlight ongoing work on long COVID incidence and symptom profiles in populations infected only by the Omicron variants. This will be beneficial toward more useful disease definitions and the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Long Covid is defined by a wide range of symptoms that persist after the acute phase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Commonly reported symptoms include fatigue, weakness, postexertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction, with many other symptoms reported. Symptom range, duration, and severity are highly variable and partially overlap with symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and other post-acute infectious syndromes, highlighting opportunities to define shared mechanisms of pathogenesis. Potential mechanisms of Long Covid are diverse, including persistence of viral reservoirs, dysregulated immune responses, direct viral damage of tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, inflammation driven by reactivation of latent viral infections, vascular endothelium activation or dysfunction, and subsequent thromboinflammation, autoimmunity, metabolic derangements, microglial activation, and microbiota dysbiosis. The heterogeneity of symptoms and baseline characteristics of people with Long Covid, as well as the varying states of immunity and therapies given at the time of acute infection, have made etiologies of Long Covid difficult to determine. Here, we examine progress on preclinical models for Long Covid and review progress being made in clinical trials, highlighting the need for large human studies and further development of models to better understand Long Covid. Such studies will inform clinical trials that will define treatments to benefit those living with this condition.">

The persistent effects of COVID-19 have become a subject of significant concern amongst the medical and scientific community. This article aims to explore the probability of a link between the COVID-19 infection and the risk of lung cancer development. First, this article reports that SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammatory response and cellular stress, potentially leading to tumorigenesis through common pathways between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer. These pathways include the JAK/STAT3 pathway which is activated after the initiation of cytokine storm following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This pathway is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and immune homeostasis. The JAK/STAT3 pathway is also hyperactivated in lung cancer which serves as a link thereof. It predisposes patients to lung cancer through myriad molecular mechanisms such as DNA damage, genomic instability, and cell cycle dysregulation. Another probable pathway to tumorigenesis is based on the possibility of an oncogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 through hijacking the p53 protein, leading to cell oxidative stress and interfering with the DNA repair mechanisms. Finally, this article highlights the overexpression of the SLC22A18 gene in lung cancer. This gene can be overexpressed by the ZEB1 transcription factor, which was found to be highly expressed during COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during human pregnancy remains highly controversial as most studies have focused on the third trimester or the peripartum period. Given the lack of early trimester data, determining the prevalence of vertical transmission during early pregnancy and assessing the potential risks for fetal morbidity and mortality poses a challenge. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on an endometrial 3D spheroid model system. The 3D spheroids are capable of decidualization and express ACE2 as well as TMPRSS2, rendering them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Employing this 3D cell model, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 can infect both non-decidualized and decidualized endometrial spheroids. Infection significantly increased the chemokine MCP-1 compared to non-infected spheroids. Decidualized spheroids exhibited upregulated chemokine IL-8 levels. Furthermore, RNA sequencing revealed dysregulation of several genes involved in tissue-specific immune response, Fc receptor signalling, angiotensin-activated signalling and actin function. Gene expression changes varied between SARS-CoV-2 infected non-decidualized and decidualized spheroids and genes associated with the innate immune system (CCL20, CD38, LCN2 and NR4A3) were dysregulated as a potential mechanism for immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our study demonstrates that endometrial spheroids are a useful model to examine the clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission, warranting further investigations.">

        <tr id="Understanding the early interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human airway epithelial cells is essential for unraveling viral replication and spread mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the early dynamics of airway epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection using well-differentiated human nasal and tracheal epithelial cell cultures by incorporating three publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We identified a previously uncharacterized cell population, termed virus-rich intermediate (VRI) cells, representing an intermediate differentiation stage between basal and ciliated cells. These VRI cells exhibited high viral loads at all infection time points, strong interferon and inflammatory responses, increased mRNA expression of microvilli-related genes (PAK1, PAK4, VIL1), and suppression of apoptosis markers (BAX, CASP3) alongside increased anti-apoptotic gene expression (BCL2). Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that VRI cells send signals to basal cells via receptor-ligand pathways such as EPHA and VEGF, likely promoting basal cell differentiation and proliferation through MAPK signaling. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes VRI cells as a primary site for replication and spread, leveraging these cells’ unique differentiation state to evade host cell death and facilitate viral propagation. This study provides insights into the early cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights potential therapeutic targets to limit viral spread.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the worst pandemics in human history. The causative virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can invade host cells in multiple organs by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II expressed on the cell surface. Once inside the host cell, viral replication takes place, leading to cellular disruption and the release of signal molecules that are recognised by the innate immune system. Innate immunity activation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and primes the adaptive immune system. The proinflammatory environment defends against further viral entry and replication. SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to lead to myocardial injury through several mechanisms. Firstly, direct viral-mediated cellular invasion of cardiomyocytes has been shown in in vitro and histological studies, which is related to cellular injury. Secondly, the proinflammatory state during COVID-19 can lead to myocardial injury and the release of protein remnants of the cardiac contractile machinery. Thirdly, the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is associated with thromboembolism of coronary arteries and/or other vascular systems. COVID-19 patients can also develop heart failure; however, the underlying mechanism is much less well-characterised than for myocardial injury. Several questions remain regarding COVID-19-related heart failure, including its potential reversibility, the role of anti-viral medications in its prevention, and the mechanisms underlying heart failure pathogenesis in long COVID-19. Further work is required to improve our understanding of the mechanism of cardiac sequelae in COVID-19, which may enable us to target SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients against longer-lasting cardiovascular complications.">

VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain.">

Tissue injuries resulting from viral infection and host hyperinflammatory responses may lead to moderate to severe pneumonia, systemic complications, and even death. While anti-inflammatory agents have been used to treat patients with severe COVID-19, their therapeutic effects are limited. GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) is a pro-inflammatory receptor expressed on vascular endothelial cells, regulating leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a GPR4 antagonist, NE-52-QQ57, in the SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Our results demonstrated that GPR4 antagonist treatment increased the survival rate in this severe COVID-19 mouse model. The inflammatory response, characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was reduced in the GPR4 antagonist group compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, both SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and infectious viral titers in the mouse lung were decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive mouse brains was also decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, the GPR4 antagonist inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero E6 cells. Together, these results suggest that GPR4 antagonism may be explored as a novel approach for the treatment of COVID-19 and other similar viral diseases.">

With the recently developed mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 stain, we are now able to model the mild COVID infection in C57BL/6 mice and study the chronic immune responses and subsequent damages in different organs long after the viruses are clearly naturally in the body. More specifically, we found adult C57BL/6J mice developed neurological impairments, including behavior changes related to sensorimotor coordination, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inflammation in multiple organs including lung, liver and brain, which persisted over at least 4 weeks in mice even with mild infection. Therefore, this model can be used to further explopred the mechanisms of PASC, as well as potential intervention or therapeutic approaches.">

Beyond its primary respiratory impact, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in various extra-pulmonary complications. Research studies reveal that the virus affects multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system (CNS), largely due to the widespread expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. Clinical evidence shows that the virus can induce diabetes by disrupting pancreatic and liver functions as well as cause acute kidney injury. Additionally, neurological complications, including cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation, have been observed in a significant number of COVID-19 patients. This review discusses the mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 to acute kidney injury, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), emphasizing its effects on pancreatic beta cells, insulin resistance, and the regulation of gluconeogenesis. We also explore how SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological complications, detailing the intricate pathways of neuro-invasion and the potential to trigger conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). By elucidating the metabolic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, this review underscores the imperative for continued research and the development of effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term and short-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is a naturally occurring pneumotropic coronavirus in the pig, providing a valuable large animal model to study acute respiratory disease. PRCV pathogenesis and the resulting immune response was investigated in pigs, the natural large animal host. We compared two strains, ISU-1 and 135, which induced differing levels of pathology in the respiratory tract to elucidate the mechanisms leading to mild or severe disease. The 135 strain induced greater pathology which was associated with higher viral load and stronger spike-specific antibody and T cell responses. In contrast, the ISU-1 strain triggered mild pathology with a more balanced immune response and greater abundance of T regulatory cells. A higher frequency of putative T follicular helper cells was observed in animals infected with strain 135 at 11 days post-infection. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage revealed differential gene expression in B and T cells between animals infected with 135 and ISU-1 at 1 day post infection. These genes were associated with cell adhesion, migration, and immune regulation. Along with increased IL-6 and IL-12 production, these data suggest that heightened inflammatory responses to the 135 strain may contribute to pronounced pneumonia. Among BAL immune cell populations, B cells and plasma cells exhibited the most gene expression divergence between pigs infected with different PRCV strains, highlighting their potential role in maintaining immune homeostasis in the respiratory tract. These findings indicate the potential of the PRCV model for studying coronavirus induced respiratory disease and identifying mechanisms that determine infection outcomes. Author summary Understanding how our immune system reacts to respiratory viruses, like SARS-CoV-2, is crucial to developing better treatments. While most COVID-19 infections are mild, some cases lead to severe lung damage, but we do not fully understand why. To study this, we used pigs, which respond more like humans compared to small animals, to explore how the immune system deals with respiratory coronaviruses. We tested two porcine respiratory coronavirus strains that caused different levels of lung damage. The more severe strain triggered a strong immune response and high inflammation, leading to lung pathology similar to that seen in severe COVID-19 cases. By contrast, the milder strain caused a balanced immune response, including more regulatory T cells that help control inflammation. We also found changes in genes related to antibody-producing cells, which may be important for controlling respiratory pathology. Interestingly, changes in immune responses and gene expression lasted long after the virus was cleared, potentially making individuals more vulnerable to future infections - similar to the “long COVID” symptoms seen in people. We propose that this pig model could help us study coronavirus-induced lung damage and test new therapies to prevent severe disease.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been shown to infect the human brain and a subset of human neurons in vitro. We have previously demonstrated that the virus enters the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons via an endosomal-lysosomal pathway, which is dependent on low levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and independent of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Here, we use hiPSC-derived neurons overexpressing ACE2 in co-culture with human astrocytes to show that the infection with both SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Omicron XBB.1.5 variants is dependent on cathepsins and can be efficiently blocked by an inhibitor of cathepsin B (CA-074-ME). The result was reproducible in non-transgenic hiPSC-derived cortical organoids. The cathepsin L inhibitor SB412515 was less effective against the Wuhan strain but equally effective against the Omicron variant. Using PCR and reinfection assays, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in neurons in 2D co-cultures. Interestingly, the infectivity of the newly produced virions declined at 24 hours post-infection despite a further increase in released viral RNA at later time points, suggesting the possible activation of an antiviral response in neurons and/or astrocytes, which is supported by a correspondent increase in the levels of secreted cytokines. Furthermore, the number of infected neurons decreased within five days, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection eventually leads to the death of the target neuronal cell in vitro. The infection also caused the accumulation of the hypoxia-inducible stress factor HIF1-α in infected neurons under normoxia. Finally, we confirm and expand the previous finding that in SARS-CoV-2 infected neurons, the microtubule-associated protein tau is hyperphosphorylated at multiple loci, including S202/T205, and mislocalized to the soma of the infected neurons. Hyperphosphorylation and mislocalization of tau are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other ‘tauopathies’. Our data provides further evidence supporting the neurodegenerative potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Summary The recent COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brain and worsen brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease. Research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can indeed infect the human brain, including a small number of neurons and other brain cells in laboratory settings. In our previous studies, we identified the endosomal pathway as the route the virus uses to enter neuronal cells. In this study, we build on that work by demonstrating that inhibitors of endo-lysosomal cathepsin proteases can block this neuronal infection. We also found that infectious progeny virions are released from the infected neuronal cells. Importantly, the infection proves harmful to the host cells, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of infected cells in experimental cultures over a five-day period. Additionally, we confirm and expand on earlier findings that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the phosphorylation and altered localization of the tau protein, a process associated with brain diseases like Alzheimer’s. Finally, we observed an increase in the production of inflammatory cytokines following neuronal infection with SARS-CoV-2, along with an accumulation of the stress marker protein HIF-1α in neurons. This protein has been linked to other viral infections and Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits neurodegenerative characteristics.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2; over the course of the disease, a dysregulated immune response leads to excessive inflammation that damages lung parenchyma and compromises its function. One of the cell lineages classically associated with pathological inflammatory processes is mast cells (MCs). MCs and their mediators have been associated with COVID-19; we previously reported the role of carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) in severe COVID-19. However, sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been poorly studied. In patients who successfully resolve the infection, one of the reported sequelae is pulmonary fibrosis (PF). The etiology and exact mechanisms are unknown, and few studies exist. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether MCs are associated with PF development after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings demonstrate that during severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an increased amount of CPA3+ MCs in areas with pneumonia, around thrombotic blood vessels, and in fibrotic tissue. Moreover, higher numbers of CPA3-expressing MCs correlate with fibrotic tissue development (r = 0.8323; p = 0.001170). These results suggest that during COVID-19, exacerbated inflammation favors the recruitment or expansion of MCs and CPA3 expression in the lungs, which favors tissue damage and a failure of repair mechanisms, leading to fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Background: Investigation of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants and COVID-19 vaccination on inflammatory and immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited in South Asia. Objectives: We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 vaccination and waves of COVID-19 on inflammatory and immunological biomarkers among COVID-19 patients in India. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of vitamin D and zinc during COVID-19 infection in India (N=181). Blood samples and data regarding vaccination doses were collected. The second (Delta) or third (Omicron) wave was determined by date of enrolment. Mixed effects linear regression with robust standard errors was used to examine associations between COVID-19 vaccination dose or wave at enrolment and C-Reactive Protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM). Results: Compared to no vaccination, full vaccination was associated with lower LDH (P<0.001), D-dimer (P=0.521) and Ang-2 (P=0.046), and higher IgG levels (P<0.001). Partial vaccination was associated with lower IL-6 (P=0.040) and higher IgG (P<0.001). Enrolment during the third wave was associated with lower IL-6 (P<0.001), CRP (P=0.056), IgM (P=0.013), and IgG (P<0.001), but higher D-dimer levels (P<0.001). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination status and SARS-CoV-2 variant influence the inflammatory and immunologic response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the severity of clinical presentation.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are a major cause of diarrheal disease, yet critical aspects of their biology, including cellular tropism, remain unclear. Although research has traditionally focused on the intestinal epithelium, the hypothesis that HuNoV infects macrophages has been recurrently discussed and is investigated here using a zebrafish larval model. Through single-cell RNA sequencing of dissected zebrafish intestines, we unbiasedly identified macrophages as host cells for HuNoV replication, with all three open reading frames mapped to individual macrophages. Notably, HuNoV preferentially infects actively phagocytosing inflammatory macrophages. HuNoV capsid proteins and double-stranded RNA colocalized within intestinal macrophages of infected zebrafish larvae, and the negative-strand RNA intermediate was detected within FACS-sorted macrophages. Flow cytometry confirmed viral replication within these macrophages, constituting approximately 23% of HuNoV’s host cells. Identifying macrophages as host cells prompts a reevaluation of their role in HuNoV pathogenesis, offering new directions for understanding and controlling this infection.">

        <tr id="Asthma, an allergic disease of the airways, is a risk factor for severity of common respiratory viral infections; however, the relationship between asthma and severity in COVID-19 remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron BA.5 strain) infection in a mouse model of airway allergy. First, stimulation of allergic mice with OVA resulted in the appearance of ACE2-negative mucus-secreting goblet cells in the bronchiolar region, and an increase in the number of ACE2-expressing cells in the alveoli. As a result, ACE2-expressing cells, which are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, were limited to the distal portion of the bronchioles while they increased in the alveolar area. After viral infection, the peak infectious viral load in the OVA group was 100-fold lower than that in the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) group; however, clearance of viral RNA from the upper/lower airways was delayed. There were notable differences in acquisition of nsp5 and nsp6 mutations by the Omicron BA.5 strain recovered from BALF samples obtained from the OVA and PBS groups. Immune responses associated with viral clearance were essentially the same, but expression of granulocyte-associated chemokines was higher, M2 macrophage responses were predominant, and the higher spike-specific IgG1/IgG2a ratio in the OVA group post-infection. Infection localized in the alveolar region earlier in the OVA group, resulting in more severe alveolar damage than in the PBS group. These data suggest a Th2-shifted immune background and altered localization of SARS-CoV-2 susceptible cells in mice with OVA-induced airway allergy, which reflect Omicron BA.5 infection dynamics, viral mutations, and immunopathology.">

        <tr id="Diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) represent two public health emergencies. In severe disease, both pathogens may share a biological niche in the lower respiratory tract. There is significant potential for SARS-CoV-2 and M.tb infections to be co-present within individuals and enhance or moderate the respective outcomes of either infection. Here, we investigated how whole blood samples, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, from individuals hospitalised with acute COVID-19 disease respond to mycobacterial challenge. To do this, samples were assessed by ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assays, immune cell phenotyping by mass cytometry, and whole blood cytokine responses to mycobacterial antigens assessed by flow cytometry. These studies identified a subgroup of COVID-19 patients whose blood had an enhanced capacity to inhibit mycobacterial growth. The ability to control mycobacterial growth was associated with the presence of a non M.tb-specific CD28+ CD8+ T cell population, with a particular activation status and migratory phenotype. This work improves our understanding of factors involved in mycobacterial control, and may contribute to the design of novel therapies for TB.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has underscored the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Recent studies have revealed a complex interplay between the circadian clock and SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung cells, opening new avenues for targeted interventions. This systems pharmacology study investigates this intricate relationship, focusing on the circadian protein BMAL1. BMAL1 plays a dual role in viral dynamics, driving the expression of the viral entry receptor ACE2 while suppressing interferon-stimulated antiviral genes. Its critical position at the host-pathogen interface suggests potential as a therapeutic target, albeit requiring a nuanced approach to avoid disrupting essential circadian regulation. To enable precise tuning of potential interventions, we constructed a computational model integrating the lung cellular clock with viral infection components. We validated this model against literature data to establish a platform for drug administration simulation studies using the REV-ERB agonist SR9009. Our simulations of optimized SR9009 dosing reveal circadian-based strategies that potentially suppress viral infection while minimizing clock disruption. This quantitative framework offers insights into the viral-circadian interface, aiming to guide the development of chronotherapy-based antivirals. More broadly, it underscores the importance of understanding the connections between circadian timing, respiratory viral infections, and therapeutic responses for advancing precision medicine. Such approaches are vital for responding effectively to the rapid spread of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 and other pandemic viruses continue being important for public health and the global economy. Therefore, it is essential to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19 more deeply, particularly its association with inflammatory and antiviral processes. In this study, we used the RNA-seq technique to analyze mRNA and non-coding RNA profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals after SARS-CoV-2 in vitro exposure, to identify pathways related to immune response and the regulatory post-transcriptional mechanisms triggered that can serve as possible complementary therapeutic targets. Our analyses show that SARS-CoV-2 induced a significant regulation in the expression of 790 genes in PBMCs, of which 733 correspond to mRNAs and 57 to non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The immune response, antiviral response, signaling, cell proliferation and metabolism are the main biological processes involved. Among these, the inflammatory response groups the majority of regulated genes with an increase in the expression of chemokines involved in the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and T-cells. Additionally, it was observed that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 induces the expression of genes related to the IL-27 pathway but not of IFN-I or IFN-III, indicating the induction of ISGs through this pathway rather than the IFN genes. Moreover, several lncRNA and RNA binding proteins that can act in the cis-regulation of genes of the IL-27 pathway were identified. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can regulate the expression of multiple genes in PBMCs, mainly related to the inflammatory and antiviral response. Among these, lncRNAs establish an important mechanism in regulating the immune response to the virus. They could contribute to developing severe forms of COVID-19, constituting a possible therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Background: The pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to severe immune responses and inflammation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this context, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) has a crucial role in inhibiting cytokine-induced immune responses. On the other hand, interleukin-29 (IL-29) and lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) are important molecules involved in inducing immune responses. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the mRNA levels of SOCS1, IL-29, and LYST in the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe symptoms. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 70 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with severe symptoms and 70 healthy controls were evaluated. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood and after cDNA synthesis, the mRNA levels of SOCS1, IL-29, and LYST were assessed by Real-Time PCR technique Results: The study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients exhibited a significant increase in mRNA levels of IL-29 compared to healthy individuals. However, there were no observed alterations in the mRNA levels of SOCS1 and LYST in the patient group. Conclusions: The results emphasize the importance of IL-29 as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 cases. Further research is needed to investigate the specific mechanisms through which IL-29 influences immune responses and contributes to the development of severe disease. Additionally, exploring other factors that may regulate SOCS1 and LYST expression could provide a more comprehensive understanding of their roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Basal ganglia disease has been reported as a post-infection sequela of several viruses, with documentation of this phenomenon from the H1N1 Spanish flu to the recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.">

        <tr id="Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new viral variants has challenged public health efforts, often evading antibody responses generated by infections and vaccinations. This immune escape has led to waves of breakthrough infections, raising questions about the efficacy and durability of immune protection. Here we focus on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron spike mutations on ACE-2 receptor binding, protein stability, and immune response evasion. Delta and Omicron variants had 3–5 times higher binding affinities to ACE-2 than the ancestral strain (KDwt = 23.4 nM, KDDelta = 8.08 nM, KDBA.1 = 4.77 nM, KDBA.2 = 4.47 nM). The pattern recognition molecule mannose-binding lectin (MBL) has been shown to recognize the spike protein. Here we found that MBL binding remained largely unchanged across the variants, even after introducing mutations at single glycan sites. Although MBL binding decreased post-vaccination, it increased by 2.6-fold upon IgG depletion, suggesting a compensatory or redundant role in immune recognition. Notably, we identified two glycan sites (N717 and N801) as potentially essential for the structural integrity of the spike protein. We also evaluated the antibody and T cell responses. Neutralization by serum immunoglobulins was predominantly mediated by IgG rather than IgA and was markedly impaired against the Delta (5.8-fold decrease) and Omicron variants BA.1 (17.4-fold) and BA.2 (14.2-fold). T cell responses, initially conserved, waned rapidly within 3 months post-Omicron infection. Our data suggests that immune imprinting may have hindered antibody and T cell responses toward the variants. Overall, despite decreased antibody neutralization, MBL recognition and T cell responses were generally unaffected by the variants. These findings extend our understanding of the complex interplay between viral adaptation and immune response, underscoring the importance of considering MBL interactions, immune imprinting, and viral evolution dynamics in developing new vaccine and treatment strategies.">

Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid.

        <tr id="A critical aspect of the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the protease-mediated activation of the viral spike (S) protein. The type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells and murine airways. However, the importance of TMPRSS2 needs to be re-examined because the ability to utilize TMPRSS2 is significantly reduced in the Omicron variants that spread globally. For this purpose, replication profiles of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed in human respiratory organoids. All tested viruses, including Omicron variants, replicated efficiently in these organoids. Notably, all SARS-CoV-2 strains retained replication ability in TMPRSS2-gene knockout (KO) respiratory organoids, suggesting that TMPRSS2 is not essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection in human respiratory tissues. However, TMPRSS2-gene knockout significantly reduces the inhibitory effect of nafamostat, indicating the advantage of TMPRSS2-utilizing ability for the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these organoids. Interestingly, Omicron variants regained the TMPRSS2-utilizing ability in recent subvariants. The basal infectivity would be supported mainly by cathepsins because the cathepsin inhibitor, EST, showed a significant inhibitory effect on infection with any SARS-CoV-2 strains, mainly when used with nafamostat. A supplementary contribution of other serine proteases was also suggested because the infection of the Delta variant was still inhibited partially by nafamostat in TMPRSS2 KO organoids. Thus, various proteases, including TMPRSS2, other serine proteases, and cathepsins, co-operatively contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly in the respiratory organoids. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human respiratory tissues would be more complex than observed in cell lines or mice.


IMPORTANCE
We explored how the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infects human respiratory organoids, which are a cultured cell model made to mimic the physiological conditions of the human airways. We focused on understanding the role of different proteases of host cells in activating the virus spike proteins. Specifically, we looked at TMPRSS2, a transmembrane serine protease, and cathepsin L, a lysosomal enzyme, which helps the virus enter cells by cutting the viral spike protein. We discovered that while TMPRSS2 is crucial for the virus in certain cells and animal models, other proteases, including cathepsins and various serine proteases, also play significant roles in the SARS-CoV-2 infection of human respiratory organoids. We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 uses a more complex mechanism involving multiple proteases to infect human airways, differing from what we see in conventional cell lines or animal models. This complexity might help explain how different variants can spread and infect people effectively.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly impacted global health, emphasizing the need to understand its pathogenicity and virulence mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the alveolar epithelial barrier and exacerbates airway inflammation, leading to acute respiratory failure, but the molecular details remain unclear. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurological symptoms, potentially due to its weakly understood ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The viral multifunctional Envelope (E) protein is crucial for its virulence, playing a key role in virus assembly, budding, and release. The E protein contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) that interacts with host PDZ domain-containing proteins, potentially affecting host signaling pathways and contributing to pathogenicity. This study focuses on the E protein PBM and its role in virulence, disrupting respiratory epithelial barriers and exacerbating airway inflammation. We generated recombinant mutant viruses lacking the PBM and conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments to elucidate its impact on viral fitness, pathogenicity, and effects on the epithelial integrity. In vitro, the viral mutants showed delayed replication and reduced cytopathic effects. In vivo, experiments with hamsters revealed that PBM-deficient viruses caused less weight loss, lower viral loads, and reduced inflammation, indicating decreased pathogenicity. Histological analyses confirmed less airway damage in these hamsters compared to those infected with the wild-type virus. Additionally, PBM-deficient viruses had impaired interactions with tight junction proteins like ZO-1, a PDZ-containing protein, crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Our findings also demonstrate that the PBM does not play a significant role in neuroinvasion during the acute phase of infection, as evidenced by comparable viral RNA loads across brain regions in infected hamsters, regardless of PBM presence. Histopathological and transcriptomic analyses further support this observation, suggesting that the PBM primarily affects specific epithelial barriers. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis on lung and brainstem from infected hamsters reveals that the PBM modulates inflammatory and immune responses, with a stronger impact in lung tissue than in the brainstem. PBM-deficient viruses induce lower levels of inflammation and cytokine expression, suggesting PBM’s specific role in enhancing viral pathogenicity through the activation of pathways such as NF-κB and TNF. Thus, the E protein PBM plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2’s fitness, virulence, and pathogenicity, through the disruption of cell junctions and inflammation, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.">

One area of increasing interest is the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the complement system, a crucial component of innate immunity. This review explores the intricate relationship between COVID-19 and the complement system, shedding light on how the virus exploits and manipulates the complement components to induce inflammatory responses leading to coagulopathies. The activation of the complement pathway simultaneously activates the coagulation cascade due to the presence of common substrates of mannan-binding serine proteases of the lectin complement system in the coagulation pathway. This cross-talk between the components of the complement and coagulation system further aggravates the dysregulation of immune responses, contributing to the cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 cases. A comprehensive understanding of this crosstalk is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe disease. Understandings into the molecular mechanisms governing this interaction may pave the way for the development of novel antiviral diagnostics and therapies based on immunomodulatory interventions, offering better management for such cases.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is adapting to continuous presence in humans. Transitions to endemic infection patterns are associated with changes in the spike (S) proteins that direct virus-cell entry. These changes generate antigenic drift and thereby allow virus maintenance in the face of prevalent human antiviral antibodies. These changes also fine tune virus-cell entry dynamics in ways that optimize transmission and infection into human cells. Focusing on the latter aspect, we evaluated the effects of several S protein substitutions on virus-cell membrane fusion, an essential final step in enveloped virus-cell entry. Membrane fusion is executed by integral-membrane “S2” domains, yet we found that substitutions in peripheral “S1” domains altered late-stage fusion dynamics, consistent with S1-S2 heterodimers cooperating throughout cell entry. A specific H655Y change in S1 stabilized a fusion-intermediate S protein conformation and thereby delayed membrane fusion. The H655Y change also sensitized viruses to neutralization by S2-targeting fusion-inhibitory peptides and stem-helix antibodies. The antibodies did not interfere with early fusion-activating steps; rather they targeted the latest stages of S2-directed membrane fusion in a novel neutralization mechanism. These findings demonstrate that single amino acid substitutions in the S proteins both reset viral entry—fusion kinetics and increase sensitivity to antibody neutralization. The results exemplify how selective forces driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and antibody evasion operate together to shape SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly impacted global health, affecting not only the immediate morbidity and mortality rates but also long-term health outcomes across various populations. Although the acute effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system have initially been the primary focus, it is increasingly evident that the virus can have significant impacts on multiple physiological systems, including the nervous and immune systems. The pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between viral infection, immune aging, and brain health, that can potentially accelerate neuroimmune aging and contribute to the persistence of long COVID conditions. By inducing chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and neuroinflammation, COVID-19 may exacerbate the processes of neuroimmune aging, leading to increased risks of cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases, and impaired immune function. Key factors include chronic immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the disruption of cellular processes. These overlapping mechanisms between aging and COVID-19 illustrate how the virus can induce and accelerate aging-related processes, leading to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases and other age-related conditions. This mini-review examines key features and possible mechanisms of COVID-19-induced neuroimmune aging that may contribute to the persistence and severity of long COVID. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective interventions. Anti-inflammatory therapies, neuroprotective agents, immunomodulatory treatments, and lifestyle interventions all hold potential for mitigating the long-term effects of the virus. By addressing these challenges, we can improve health outcomes and quality of life for millions affected by the pandemic.">

Here, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 viral vector composed of all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins constitutively expressed in lentivirally transduced cells, combined with an RNA replicon deleted for SARS-CoV-2 structural protein genes S, M and E, and expressing a luciferase-GFP fusion protein. We show that, after concentrating viral stocks by ultracentrifugation, the SARS-CoV-2 viral vector is able to infect two human cell lines expressing receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Both luciferase activity and GFP fluorescence were detected, and transduction was remdesivir-sensitive. We also show that this vector is inhibited by three type I interferons (IFN-I) subtypes. Although improvements are needed to increase infectious titers, this vector system may prove useful for antiviral drug screening and SARS-CoV-2-related investigations.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes the extremely infectious sickness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Globally, COVID-19 (simply, COVID) has had a terrible impact, killing more than 6 million people. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly around the globe since the first instance of this respiratory viral infection was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on 31 December 2019. Keeping given epidemiological estimates, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Post-COVID is a clinical condition characterized by the development of totally new COVID-19 symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-affected patients have been reporting a range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities which include myocardial inflammation, myocardial infarction, right ventricular dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, coronary artery atherosclerosis, focal myocardial fibrosis, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, viral myocarditis, postural orthostatic tachycardia symptom (POTS), aortic and arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, and arrhythmias. Cardiopulmonary symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, hypotension, and POTS are common and associated with significant disability and heightened anxiety. Additionally, the risk of CV side effects has also been reported with currently available COVID-19 vaccines. Pathophysiological mechanisms for post-COVID cardiac complications are still poorly understood. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiac diseases which are abundant in those at risk of severe disease. This review discusses the definition of post-COVID complications, pathophysiological mechanisms of underlying acute and chronic CV injury, and their impact post-COVID-19 on multiorgan health.

        <tr id="Intra-host diversity is an intricate phenomenon related to immune evasion, antiviral resistance, and evolutionary leaps along transmission chains. SARS-CoV-2 intra-host variation has been well-evidenced from respiratory samples. However, data on systemic dissemination and diversification are relatively scarce and come from immunologically impaired patients. Here, the presence and variability of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed among 71 tissue samples obtained from multiple organs including lung, intestine, heart, kidney, and liver from 15 autopsies with positive swabs and no records of immunocompromise. The virus was detected in most organs in the majority of autopsies. All organs presented intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) with low, moderate, and high abundances. The iSNV abundances observed within different organs indicate that the virus can mutate at one host site and subsequently spread to other parts of the body. In agreement with previous data from respiratory samples, our lung samples presented no more than 10 iSNVs each. But interestingly, when analyzing different organs we were able to detect between 11 and 45 iSNVs per case. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate, and evolve in a compartmentalized manner, in different body sites, which agrees with the "viral reservoir" theory. We elaborate on how compartmentalized evolution in multiple organs may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 evolving so rapidly despite the virus having a proofreading mechanism.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) still causes death in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, for whom the sustainability of the vaccine response may be limited. Antiviral treatments, such as remdesivir or molnupiravir, have demonstrated limited clinical efficacy. Nirmatrelvir, an acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) major protease inhibitor, is clinically effective but has been associated with viral rebound and antiviral resistance. It is thus necessary to study novel and repurposed antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. We previously demonstrated that daclatasvir (DCV), an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein, impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting viral RNA polymerase and exonuclease, but the doses of DCV used to inhibit the new coronavirus are greater than the standard human plasma exposure for hepatitis C. Because any potential use of DCV against SARS-CoV-2 would be shorter than that reported here and short-term toxicological studies on DCV show that higher doses are tolerable, we searched for doses of DCV that could protect transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (K18-hACE-2) from lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2. We found that a dose of 60 mg/kg/day provides this protection by reducing virus replication and virus-induced lung insult. This dose is tolerable in different animal models. Taken together, our data provide preclinical evidence that can support phase I clinical trials to confirm the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of new doses of daclatasvir for a short duration in humans to further advance this compound’s utility against COVID-19.">

However, the underlying cis-regulatory genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their impact on clinical phenotypes remain enigmatic. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underscore the importance of expanding the study of regulatory variation to relevant cell types and disease contexts and argue for the existence of extensive gene-environment effects among patients responding to an infection.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 (LC) is a poorly understood, multifactorial condition that persists for at least three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the wide range of associated symptoms—including fatigue, brain fog, and respiratory issues—remain unclear. However, emerging evidence suggests that the reactivation of latent viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus, may significantly contribute to the complexity of LC. These latent viruses can be reactivated by SARS-CoV-2, contributing to a chronic inflammatory state that prolongs symptomatology. This review confirms the potential involvement of latent viral infections in LC and examines whether these infections play an independent role or act synergistically with other factors. In addition, recent studies have highlighted viral persistence and immune dysregulation as key elements in LC. Our findings suggest that preventative strategies, including vaccination and antiviral treatments during the acute phase of COVID-19, show potential in reducing LC risk by preventing viral reactivation. However, tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting these latent infections are urgently needed. Identifying biomarkers of viral reactivation, particularly for high-risk populations, could be considered another effective strategy to mitigate LC severity. Further research is crucial to better understand the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and latent infections, and to improve the prevention and treatment of LC.">

Investigations of the gene expression changes accompanying the infection state provide insight into the molecular and cellular processes depending on the sickness severity and virus variants. Severe Delta COVID-19 has been characterized by the appearance of a monocyte subset enriched for proinflammatory gene expression signatures and a shift in ligand–receptor interactions. We profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of 140,000 nuclei in PBMC samples from healthy individuals or individuals with COVID-19. We investigated cis-regulatory elements and identified the core transcription factors governing gene expression in immune cells during COVID-19 infection. In severe cases, we discovered that regulome and chromatin co-accessibility modules were significantly altered across many cell types. Moreover, cases with the Delta variant were accompanied by a specific monocyte subtype discovered using scATAC-seq data. Our analysis showed that immune cells of individuals with severe Delta COVID-19 underwent significant remodeling of the chromatin accessibility landscape and development of the proinflammatory expression pattern. Using a gene regulatory network modeling approach, we investigated the core transcription factors governing the cell state and identified the most pronounced chromatin changes in CD14+ monocytes from individuals with severe Delta COVID-19. Together, our results provide novel insights into cis-regulatory module organization and its impact on gene activity in immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Viral immunosuppression substantially affects the host immune response of infected patients and the protective efficacy of vaccines. Here, we found that the spike (S) protein, the major vaccine antigen of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), strongly suppresses host innate immunity by inhibiting interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression through both S1 and S2 subunits. Mechanistically, the S protein inhibited the formation of the classic interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 by competing with STAT2 for binding to IRF9, thereby impeding the transcription of ISGs. A strong interaction between S and the STAT1/STAT2 proteins further traps the ISGF3 complex in the endoplasmic reticulum and hinders the nuclear translocation of ISGF3. Notably, the interferon-inhibitory mechanism of the S protein was universal among SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), through the most evolutionarily conserved region of S2 subunit. Taken together, the findings of this study reveal a new mechanism by which the coronavirus S protein attenuates the host antiviral immune response and provides new insights into the proper design of coronavirus S-based vaccines to prevent immunosuppressive effects.


IMPORTANCE
This study unveils a new mechanism by which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein attenuates the host's antiviral immune response. The interferon-inhibitory mechanism of the S protein was universal among SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, through conserved S2 domains. Our study expands the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses in evading antiviral immune strategies, which is very important for the design and optimization of vaccine antigens, thus providing a theoretical basis for human anti-coronavirus immunity and understanding the interaction between the host and coronavirus.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and risk of long COVID has been associated with the depletion or over-abundance of specific taxa within the gut microbiome. However, the microbial mechanisms mediating these effects are not yet known. We hypothesized that altered microbial production of tryptophan and its downstream derivatives might contribute to inappropriate immune responses to viral infection. In patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 172), serum levels of tryptophan and indole-3-propionate (IPA) negatively correlated with serum levels of many proinflammatory mediators (including C-reactive protein and Serum amyloid A), while C-glycosyltryptophan (C-Trp), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were positively correlated with levels of acute phase proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, alarmins and chemokines. A similar pattern was observed in long COVID patients (n = 20) where tryptophan and IPA were negatively associated with a large number of serum cytokines, while C-Trp and IAA were positively associated with circulating cytokine levels. Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota showed the relative abundance of genes encoding the microbial enzymes required for tryptophan production (e.g. anthranilate synthase) and microbial tryptophan metabolism was significantly lower in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 380) compared to healthy controls (n = 270). Microbial tryptophan metabolites reduced innate cell proinflammatory responses to cytosolic DNA sensor Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 and TLR-4 stimulation in vitro, while IL-10 secretion was enhanced. Microbial tryptophan metabolites also modified ex vivo human lymphocyte responses by limiting the production of TH1 and TH17 associated cytokines, while enhancing secretion of IL-22. These data suggest that lower levels of tryptophan production and tryptophan metabolism by gut microbes may increase the risk of severe and chronic outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to impaired innate and adaptive responses to infection. Screening patients for lower-level microbiome capacity for tryptophan metabolism may help identify at-risk individuals.">

Here, we present a human 2D intestinal immuno-organoid system to model HIV-1 disease that recapitulates tissue compartmentalization and epithelial-immune cellular interactions. Our data demonstrate that apical exposure of intestinal epithelium to HIV-1 results in viral internalization, with subsequent basolateral shedding of replication-competent viruses, in a manner that is impervious to antiretroviral treatment. Incorporation of subepithelial dendritic cells resulted in HIV-1 luminal sampling and amplification of residual viral replication of lab-adapted and transmitted-founder (T/F) HIV-1 variants. Markedly, intraepithelial viral capture ensued an altered distribution of specialized endosomal pathways alongside durable sequestration of infectious HIV-1 within lysobisphosphatidic acid (LPBA)-rich vesicles. Therapeutic neutralization of LBPA-dependent trafficking limited productive HIV-1 infection, and thereby demonstrated the pivotal role of intraepithelial multivesicular endosomes as niches for virulent HIV-1 within the intestinal mucosa.

 With SARS-CoV-2 became regional epidemics, substantial amount of patients suffers from post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, aka long COVID). Exploring the pathogenesis and especially the heterogenicity features of long COVID subgroups is of paramount importance for etiology understandings. In this study, through integrative multi-omics analyses encompassing transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, long COVID patients exhibited overall elevated MAPK pathway activation, while patients recovered from long COVID showed down-regulation of this response. Long COVID heterogenicity is described by multi-omics distinct signatures for each subgroup. Multisystemic (MULTI) symptoms subgroup is characterized by enhanced glycerophospholipid and ether lipid metabolism, Neurological (NEU) by augmented glycoprotein synthesis metabolism, Cardio cerebral (CACRB) by increased pyruvate metabolism and suppressed macrophage polarization, Musculoskeletal + Systemic (MSK + SYST) by elevated glycerophospholipid metabolism, and Cardiopulmonary (CAPM) by inhibited NF-κB signaling pathways. ABHD17A, CSNK1D, PSME4 and SYVN1 were general long COVID combination biomarkers, while CRH (MULTI), FPGT (NEU), CBX6 (CACRB) and RBBP4 (CAPM) were selected as serum-specific subgroup proteins.

CSF derives from and borders central nervous system (CNS) tissue, allowing for comprehensive accounting of cell types along with their relative abundance and immunologic profiles relevant to CNS diseases. Using integration techniques applied to publicly available datasets in combination with our own studies, we generated a compendium with 139 subjects encompassing 135 CSF and 58 blood samples. Healthy subjects and individuals across a wide range of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, COVID-19, and autoimmune encephalitis, were included. We found differences in lymphocyte and myeloid subset frequencies across different diseases as well as in their distribution between blood and CSF. We identified what we believe to be a new subset of AREG+ dendritic cells exclusive to the CSF that was more abundant in subjects with MS compared with healthy controls. Finally, transcriptional cell states in CSF microglia-like cells and lymphoid subsets were elucidated. Altogether, we have created a reference compendium for single-cell transcriptional profiling encompassing CSF immune cells useful to the scientific community for future studies on neurologic diseases.">

        <tr id="Chronic intervillositis of unknown etiology (CIUE) is an aberrant maternal inflammatory infiltrate comprised primarily of macrophages that collect in the intervillus space and is associated with poor outcomes including recurrent pregnancy loss. An abnormal maternal Th1-type response to pregnancy may be the basis for pathogenesis of CIUE but macrophage in the maternal infiltrate of CIUE have been reported to have an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype characterized by increased expression of CD163. This study assesses expression of CD163 in CIUE and SARS-CoV-2 placentitis, which has a similar histopathological presentation, using an automated approach to minimize observer-related variability. The data show that the maternal inflammatory infiltrate of CIUE contains a blended population of high and low CD163 expressing macrophage with a prominent bias towards an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype when compared to normal control tissue. A similar pattern is seen in SARS-CoV-2 placentitis, suggesting pathophysiologic similarity with CIUE, although SARS-CoV-2 also appears to promote decreased CD163 expression in Hofbauer cells, which is not seen in CIUE.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 enters cells primarily by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, thereby blocking its physiological functions, affecting the apelinergic system, and inhibiting the cleavage of its peptides. The appropriate concentration of peptides in the apelinergic system influences the maintenance of homeostasis and protects against cardiovascular diseases. In our research, we determined the level of selected parameters of the apelinergic system—apelin (AP), elabela (ELA), and the apelin receptor (APJ)—in repeat blood donors. Methods: We analyzed 120 serum samples obtained from 30 repeat donors (study group) within four time periods after a SARS-CoV-2 infection: <60 days, 61–90 days, 91–120 days, and >120 days. We compared the results from the study groups with those of the control group, which consisted of 30 serum samples collected from donors donating blood in the years 2018–2019. Results: We observed that the AP, ELA, and APJ concentrations in the control group are higher than in any period in the study group. In the study group, the concentrations of AP and ELA increased in subsequent study periods. AP and ELA concentrations were lower shortly after SARS-CoV-2 transfection and then slowly increased in subsequent periods. APJ concentrations, on the other hand, were lowest at 61–90 days after the infection, but the decrease, relative to their level in healthy subjects, was significant in every period studied. Conclusions: The results suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes changes in the parameters of the apelinergic system, both after a short period of time has passed since the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and even up to 4 months after the infection.">

        <tr id="Background. Understanding the interference patterns of respiratory viruses could be important for shedding light on potential strategies to combat these human infectious agents. Objective. To investigate the possible interactions between adenovirus type 2 (AdV2), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A/H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm09) using the A549 cell line. Methods. Single infections, co-infections, and superinfections (at 3 and 24 h after the first virus infection) were performed by varying the multiplicity of infection (MOI). Virus replication kinetics and the mRNA expression of IFN-α, IL-1α and IL-6 were assessed by real-time qPCR. Results. Co-infection experiments showed different growth dynamics, depending on the presence of the specific virus and time. AdV2 replication remained stable or possibly enhanced in the presence of co-infection with each of the two H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses used. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 replication was facilitated by H1N1pdm09 but hindered by AdV2, indicating possible different interactions. Finally, H1N1pdm09 replication exhibited variably effectiveness in the presence of AdV2 and SARS-CoV-2. Superinfection experiments showed that the replication of all viruses was affected by time and MOI. The mRNA expression of IFN-α, IL-1α and IL-6 showed divergent results depending on the virus used and the time of infection. Conclusions. Further investigation of co-infection or superinfection may be helpful in understanding the potential relationship involved in the outcome of viral respiratory infection in the human population.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids. SUMMARY The neurotropic Usutu virus can cause encephalitis driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment, microglia activation and blood-brain barrier disruption, all of which are inhibited by glucocorticoid treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a significant global public health challenge. While respiratory symptoms dominate, the virus's impact on other systems, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), has gained increasing attention. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates tropism for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, expressed in the olfactory epithelium, lungs, endothelium, kidneys, enterocytes, and neurons, contributing to neurological manifestations observed during the acute phase of the disease.  
Materials and Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. Keywords included: COVID-19, Post Acute COVID-19 Syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 Virus, Neurological Manifestations, and Central Nervous System Viral Diseases. A total of 58 articles were selected for analysis based on relevance and quality of evidence regarding neurological symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19.  
Basic Results: The acute phase of COVID-19 frequently involves neurological symptoms such as frontal and holocranial headaches, dizziness, gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, and alterations in consciousness. Severe complications, though less common, include encephalitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and myelitis. These conditions often present as altered mental status, seizures, aphasia, headaches, or focal deficits, contributing substantially to patient morbidity and mortality.  
Conclusions: Neurological symptoms and complications constitute a significant aspect of COVID-19, highlighting the virus's potential to affect the CNS. While severe complications are rare, their profound impact on prognosis underscores the importance of early recognition and management. Further research is essential to understand the pathophysiology and optimise therapeutic approaches for affected patients. ">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a significant threat to global public health. Immunopathological damage plays a role in driving pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure in severe COVID-19. Therefore, dissecting the pulmonary immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to understand disease pathogenesis and identify immune pathways targetable by therapeutic intervention. Considering that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 enhances COVID-19 disease severity, therapeutic targeting of upstream signals that drive type 2 immunity may confer further protection. In this study, we investigate the role of the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis, a potent inducer of type 2 immunity in the lung, in a mouse model of COVID-19. Upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10, ST2-/- mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (69.2% vs 13.3% survival; P = 0.0005), as compared to wild-type mice. In a complementary pharmacologic approach, IL-33/ST2 signaling was inhibited using HpBARI_Hom2, a helminth derived protein that binds to mouse ST2 and blocks IL-33 signaling. In SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (60% vs 10% survival; P = 0.0035), as compared to inert control-treated mice. These data demonstrate that loss of IL-33/ST2 signaling confers protection during acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, implicating the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis as an enhancer of COVID-19 disease severity. The protection conferred by pharmacologic blockade of IL-33/ST2 signaling was independent of viral control, as HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had no reduction in viral titers. This finding suggests an immunopathogenic role for IL-33/ST2 signaling. One potential mechanism through which IL-33/ST2 signaling may drive severe disease is through enhancement of type 2 immune pathways including IL-5 production, as pulmonary IL-5 concentrations were found to depend on IL-33/ST2 signaling in acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection.">

        <tr id="Monocytes are essential for replenishing homeostatic macrophages in the intestine. However, they also accumulate in significant numbers when intestinal homeostasis is disrupted in diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The molecular pathways governing monocyte behaviour across these different contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of monocytes that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs). These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate increased expression of IBD susceptibility genes. By performing cross-species analysis, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis in mice. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete precursor in the bone marrow (BM) and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans. Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production. Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as a global pandemic pathogen with high mortality. While treatments have been developed to reduce morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, more antivirals with broad-spectrum activities are still needed. Here we identified lonafarnib (LNF), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug inhibitor of cellular farnesyltransferase (FTase), as an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. LNF inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and acted synergistically with known anti-SARS antivirals. LNF was equally active against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants. Mechanistic studies suggested that LNF targeted multiple steps of viral life cycle. Using other structurally diverse FTase inhibitors and LNF-resistant FTase mutant, we demonstrated a key role of FTase in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. To demonstrate in vivo efficacy, we infected SARS-CoV-2 susceptible humanized mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and treated them with LNF. LNF at clinically relevant dose suppressed viral titer in the respiratory tract and improved pulmonary pathology and clinical parameters. Our study demonstrated that LNF, an approved oral drug with excellent human safety data, is a promising antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that warrants further clinical assessment for treatment of COVID-19 and potentially other viral infections.">

        <tr id="In addition to adaptive immunity, natural killer (NK) cells of the innate immune system contribute to the control of viral infections. The HLA-E-restricted SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13232-240 epitope VMPLSAPTL renders infected cells susceptible to NK cells by preventing binding to the inhibitory receptor NKG2A. Here, we report that a recently emerged methionine to isoleucine substitution at position 2 (pM2I) of Nsp13232-240 impairs binding of the mutated epitope to HLA-E and diminishes HLA-E/peptide complex stability. Structural analyses revealed altered occupancy of the HLA-E B-pocket as the underlying cause for reduced presentation and stability of the mutated epitope. Functionally, the reduced presentation of the mutated epitope correlated with elevated binding to NKG2A as well as with increased NK cell inhibition. Moreover, the pM2I mutation associated with enhanced estimated viral fitness and was transmitted to descendants of the SARS-CoV-2 BQ.1 variant. Interestingly, the mutated epitope resembles sequences of related peptides found in endemic common cold-causing human coronaviruses. Altogether, these findings indicate compromised peptide presentation as a viral adaptation to evade NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance by enabling enhanced presentation of self-peptide and restoring NKG2A-dependent inhibition of NK cells.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Many common symptoms in post-acute sequelae following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) overlap with those of multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined symptoms and performance of the PASC score, developed in the general population, in MS based on infection history.


METHODS
We surveyed North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry participants regarding infections and categorized participants based on infection history. Symptoms experienced before, during, and after infection were used to identify persistent new symptoms. PASC was defined as a score ⩾ 12 based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study RECOVER.


RESULTS
Of 4787 participants surveyed, 2927 were included: 294 (10%) having recent COVID-19; 853 (29.1%) recent non-COVID-19 infection; 246 (8.4%) recent COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infection; 1534 (52.4%) uninfected, defined as never having COVID-19 nor any infection within the past 6 months. Compared to those uninfected, infection groups reported at least a two-fold increase in fever, cough, loss of smell/taste, and shortness of breath. Based on persistent new symptoms, PASC was identified in only 1.5% of participants with COVID-19.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests lower than expected prevalence of PASC in MS and a complex association between infections and development of new persistent symptoms following infections. The similar proportions classified with PASC across infection groups shows that symptoms of PASC are common and complicate assessment of PASC in MS.">

Macrophage inflammatory responses impact COVID-19 severity; however, it is unclear whether macrophages are infected by SARS-CoV-2. We sought to identify mechanisms regulating macrophage expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and to determine if macrophages are susceptible to productive infection. We developed a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mouse whereby hACE2 cDNA was cloned into the mouse ACE2 locus under control of the native promoter. We validated susceptibility of hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to wild-type mice and an established K18-hACE2 model of acute fulminating disease. Intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 led to pulmonary consolidations with cellular infiltrate, edema, and hemorrhage, consistent with pneumonia, yet unlike the K18-hACE2 model, hACE2 mice survived and maintained stable weight. Infected hACE2 mice also exhibited a unique plasma chemokine, cytokine, and growth factor inflammatory signature relative to K18-hACE2 mice. Infected hACE2 mice demonstrated evidence of viral replication in infiltrating lung macrophages, and infection of macrophages in vitro revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of altered RNA and ribosomal processing machinery as well as activated cellular antiviral defense. Macrophage IL-1β-driven NF-κB transcription of ACE2 was an important mechanism of dynamic ACE2 upregulation, promoting macrophage susceptibility to infection. Experimental models of COVID-19 that make use of native hACE2 expression will allow for mechanistic insight into factors that can either promote host resilience or increase susceptibility to worsening severity of infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Understanding how RNA viral load changes (viral load kinetics) during acute infection in SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify when and which patients are most infectious. We seek to summarise existing data on the longitudinal RNA viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 sampled from different parts of the respiratory tract (nose, nasopharynx, oropharynx, saliva and exhaled breath) and how this may vary with age, sex, ethnicity, immune status, disease severity, vaccination, treatment and virus variant. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis, using studies identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE (via Ovid). All research studies reporting primary data on longitudinal RNA viral load kinetics of infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 will be included. Methodological quality will be assessed using a validated checklist for longitudinal studies as well as predefined quality criteria for assessment of individual-level RNA viral load. Should the data allow, we will aim to perform individual patient-level meta-analysis. Our primary outcomes are duration to, and quantity of peak RNA viral load, and total duration of viral load shedding within different respiratory compartments. Secondary outcomes include duration of lateral flow antigen and virus culture positivity and variation of RNA viral load by age, immune status, disease severity, vaccination, treatment, lateral flow tests, viral culture positivity and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Study-level effects affecting observations, but not related to properties of the patient, such as the PCR platform and gene target will also be recorded. Random-effects models will estimate the population mean and individual-level variation in viral shedding conditional on the aforementioned variables. Finally, we will summarise the key mechanistic models used in the literature to reconstruct individual-level viral kinetics and estimate how different factors shape viral dynamics over time. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not needed as data will be obtained from published articles or studies with data that have already received and ethical review for analysis. Manuscript(s) will be prepared for publication. Systematic review protocol registration PROSPERO ID: CRD42023385315">

        <tr id=". Literature data on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection in people with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (RD) are contradictory. According to most studies, the risk of infection and development of severe forms of COVID-19 is higher in patients with RD compared to the general population, but largely depends on the type and activity of RD. Patients with severe RD most often required mechanical ventilation and died more often. This is due to immune dysfunction caused by both the disease itself and antirheumatic therapy using immunomodulatory drugs. The state of immunosuppression, additional comorbid chronic diseases and incomplete vaccination are factors in the need for hospitalization, intensive care, the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes and reinfection with coronavirus in patients with RD. They retained their significance during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Although there is no complete consensus in the literature regarding the association between the presence of rheumatic diseases and the severity of COVID-19, in general, rheumatic diseases are not considered to be a factor that increases the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the antibody response and reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19. However, people with rheumatic diseases have reduced or absent antibody production in response to even full vaccination and higher rates of breakthrough infection after vaccination. Further research on specific rheumatic diseases and the use of antirheumatic drugs in the context of COVID-19 is needed to reduce the severity of COVID-19 in this population.">

        <tr id="Introduction Long COVID is a debilitating condition that lasts for more than three months post-infection by SARS–CoV–2. On average, one in ten individuals infected with SARS CoV- 2 develops Long COVID worldwide. A knowledge gap exists in our understanding of the mechanisms, genetic risk factors, and biomarkers that could be associated with Long COVID. Methods In this pilot study we used RNA-Seq to quantify the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from COVID-recovered individuals, seven with and seven without Long COVID symptoms (age- and sex-matched individuals), on average 6 months after infection. Results Seventy genes were identified as significantly up- or down-regulated in Long COVID samples, and the vast majority were downregulated. The most significantly up- or downregulated genes fell into two main categories, either associated with cell survival or with inflammation. This included genes such as ICOS (FDR p = 0.024) and S1PR1 (FDR p = 0.019) that were both up-regulated, indicating that a pro-inflammatory state is sustained in Long COVID PBMCs compared with COVID recovered PBMCs. Functional enrichment analysis identified that immune-related functions were expectedly predominant among the up- or down-regulated genes. The most frequently downregulated genes in significantly altered functional categories were two leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptors LILRB1 (FDR p = 0.005) and LILRB2 (FDR p = 0.027). PCA analysis demonstrated that LILRB1 and LILRB2 expression discriminated all of the Long COVID samples from COVID recovered samples. Discussion Downregulation of these inhibitory receptors similarly indicates a sustained pro-inflammatory state in Long COVID PBMCs. LILRB1 and LILRB2 should be validated as prospective biomarkers of Long COVID in larger cohorts, over time and against clinically overlapping conditions.">

        <tr id="T cells are involved in protective immunity against numerous viral infections. Data regarding functional roles of human T cells in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) viral clearance in primary COVID-19 are limited. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed samples for associations between SARS2 upper respiratory tract viral RNA levels and early virus-specific adaptive immune responses for 95 unvaccinated clinical trial participants with acute primary COVID-19 aged 18–86 years old, approximately half of whom were considered at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Functionality and magnitude of acute SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated, in addition to antibody responses. Most individuals with acute COVID-19 developed SARS2-specific T cell responses within 6 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Early CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were polyfunctional, and both strongly associated with reduced upper respiratory tract SARS2 viral RNA, independent of neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, these findings provide evidence for protective roles for circulating SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The global spread of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 has posed unique challenges to public health. This review was carried out from the perspective of immunological and pathological changes affecting epidemiological features of the disease during progression and therapy. COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system but may also affect cardiovascular and neurological systems, manifesting various symptoms from fever and cough to such severe complications as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and organ failure. Patterns in immune responses involving decreases in peripheral T cells and natural killer cells have been recognized as being part of a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Finally, it discusses the dynamic of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including droplet mode spread and possible fecal-oral pathway. The virus's structural and pathological attributes are emphasized, complemented by a historical overview that chronicles its transformation from a non-threatening variant to a worldwide hazard. Various management approaches, encompassing traditional Indian medicinal practices and immune-enhancing measures such as zinc, iron, magnesium, vitamins, and herbal treatments, are assessed regarding their effectiveness in bolstering immunity and facilitating recovery. Additionally, lifestyle habits such as physical activity, sufficient rest, and proper hydration contribute to the maintenance of immune health. This extended review presents analyses of SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of immune alteration and a unified approach toward the understanding and combat of COVID-19.">

The first part of the review summarizes the contributions of critical immune cell populations such as microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells in mediating inflammation and metabolism in CNS disorders. The remainder of the review addresses the impact of metabolic changes on immune cell activation and disease progression in brain aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, we also address the therapeutic potential of targeting immunometabolic pathways to reduce neuroinflammation and slow disease progression.

        <tr id="Advanced age increases the risk of severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as incidence of long COVID and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We hypothesized that perturbations in the aged antiviral CD8+ T cell response predisposes elderly individuals to severe coronavirus infection, re-infection, and postinfectious cognitive sequelae. Using MHV-A59 as a murine model of respiratory coronavirus, we found that aging increased CNS infection and lethality to MHV infection. This was coupled with increased CD8+ T cells within the aged CNS but reduced antigen specificity. Aged animals also displayed a decreased proportion of CD103+ resident memory cells (TRM), which correlated with increased severity of secondary viral challenge. Using a reciprocal adoptive transfer paradigm, data show that not only were fewer aged CD8+ T cells retained within the adult brain post-infection, but also that adult CD8+ cells expressed lower levels of TRM marker CD103 when in the aged microenvironment. Furthermore, aged animals demonstrated spatial learning impairment following MHV infection, which worsened in both aged and adult animals following secondary viral challenge. Spatial learning impairment was accompanied by increased TUNEL positivity in hippocampal neurons, suggestive of neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, primary cell coculture showed that activated CD8+ T cells induced TUNEL positivity in neurons, independent of antigen-specificity. Altogether, these results show that non-antigen specific CD8+ T cells are recruited to the aged brain and cause broad neuronal death without establishing a TRM phenotype that confers lasting protection against a secondary infection.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 causes a global pandemic, with severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients often experiencing poor prognoses. Severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation. Detecting markers of macromolecular damage caused by OS may provide valuable insights into disease progression. Methods: This study included 187 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, categorized into non-severe, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 groups. We monitored the changes in serum indexes such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL), OxLDL/LDL-C ratio, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in patients with different clinical types. Results: 48 non-severe patients, 90 severe patients, and 49 critically ill patients were enrolled. Compared with the non-severe group, OxLDL level and OxLDL/LDL-C ratio were increased in severe COVID-19 patients and critically ill COVID-19 patients, while 3-NT and TXB2 concentrations were lower in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Critically ill COVID-19 patients also exhibited lower concentrations of Lp-PLA2 and a higher OxLDL/LDL-C ratio compared to severe COVID-19 patients. No significant differences were observed in AOPP and 8-OHdG concentrations. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that CRP was associated with OxLDL, OxLDL/LDL-C ratio, AOPP, 3-NT, TXB2, and Lp-PLA2 (P <0.05). OxLDL was identified as an independent risk factor for progression from non-severe to severe/critically ill COVID-19. OxLDL and OxLDL/LDL-C ratio demonstrated good discriminatory value between non-severe and severe/critically ill COVID-19, with the OxLDL/LDL-C ratio also distinguishing between severe and critically ill patients. Conclusion: Patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19 exhibit elevated levels of oxidative damage to lipoproteins. OxLDL and the OxLDL/LDL-C ratio can serve as biomarkers for assessing disease severity in COVID-19 patients.">

Although the risk of emerging coronavirus infection may seem to have disappeared at first glance, SARS-COV-2 has complex and poorly understood effects on many organ systems, including the nervous system. Disease progression and unfavorable outcome COVID-19 are not only due to lung damage, elderly age, concomitant pathology: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc. have a significant impact.Aim. To study the structure of mortality in a new coronavirus infection COVID-19, caused by delta strain of coronavirus SARS- CoV-2, taking into account the nature of concomitant therapeutic and neurological pathology, the degree of comorbidity, fatal complications, and sex and age characteristics.Materials and methods. A postmortem analysis of pathological and anatomical conclusions of 209 patients with COVID-19 with comorbid somatic and neurological pathology who received inpatient treatment in covid hospitals of the Republic of Mordovia in 2021 was performed. The severity of the underlying disease, concomitant therapeutic and neurological pathology, and comorbidity were analysed. The coincidence of the final clinical and pathological diagnoses, fatal complications were assessed. The presented data allowed to identify the main factors of unfavourable outcome.Results and discussion. In unfavourable outcome of the disease, concomitant pathology is represented by hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, chronic cerebral ischemia. In women, cases of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis were more frequent, in men - hypertension and chronic heart failure.Conclusions. New coronavirus COVID-19 infection associated with delta strain of SARS-COV-2 virus is characterised by severe and extremely severe course in elderly patients with comorbid somatic and neurological pathology.">

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, represents a significant and complex health challenge with a wide range of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the emerging evidence suggesting a critical role of the gut and gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of Long COVID. It explores how changes in the gut microbiome, disruption of gut barrier integrity, and the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens within the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to the prolonged and varied symptoms seen in Long COVID, including chronic inflammation and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The review also summarizes key insights gained about Long COVID, highlighting its multifactorial nature, which involves immune dysregulation, microvascular damage, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, with the gut playing a central role in these processes. While progress has been made in understanding these mechanisms, current evidence remains inconclusive. The challenges of establishing causality, standardizing research methodologies, and addressing individual variations in the microbiome are discussed, emphasizing the need for further longitudinal studies and more comprehensive approaches to enhance our understanding of these complex interactions. This review underscores the importance of personalized approaches in developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Long COVID, while also acknowledging the significant gaps in our current understanding. Future research should aim to further unravel the complex interplay between the gut and Long COVID, ultimately improving outcomes for those affected by this condition.">

We analyzed the inflammatory biomarker profiles of fifty SARS-Cov-2 negative healthy controls from before the COVID-19 pandemic, and eighty patients in the acute phase (Day 1, Day 7 and Day 14), and during 4 months and 2 years after hospitalization.Four months after hospitalization, 91.3% (73/80) of patients exhibited onset of long COVID symptoms, which persisted in 63.7% (51/80) after 2 years. Comparing the baseline values of the cytokines in the controls versus the follow-up times, the cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were high in the acute phase, declining over time after the individual’s recovery, while IL-1β showed an inverse variation, remaining high after 2 years. IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF increased over time post-acute infection, indicating a long-term inflammatory response. Vaccination with four doses, compared to three doses, showed a slight protective effect against fatigue symptoms in the male population (IRR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22 - 1.02; p=0.054). Neutrophil and leukocyte counts showed a significant reduction 2 years after hospitalization. However, platelet count was the laboratory biomarker that best reflects the prediction of long COVID symptoms up for to 2 years.Although the frequency of long COVID symptoms declines over time after the acute illness, symptoms continue to persist 2 years after hospital discharge. Vaccination with a fourth dose booster appears to significantly influence reduction of symptoms associated with long COVID fatigue among the males. We further identified important laboratory biomarkers for long COVID. Elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF, along with low levels of IL-6, IL-18, and IL-12p70, also offer new insights into the inflammatory state in long COVID.">

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the population unequally, with a greater impact on older and immunosuppressed people. Methods Hence, we performed a prospective experimental cohort study to characterise the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in immune-compromised patients (older adults and oncohaematologic patients), compared with healthy counterparts, based on deep characterisation of the circulating immune cell subsets. Results and discussion While acquired humoral and cellular memory did not predict subsequent infection 18 months after full vaccination, spectral and computational cytometry revealed several subsets within the CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and TEMRA Tγδ cells that were differentially expressed in individuals who were subsequently infected and not infected not just following immunisation, but also prior to vaccination. Of note, we found up to seven clusters within the TEMRA Tγδ cell population, with some of them being expanded and others decreased in subsequently infected individuals. Moreover, some of these cellular clusters were also related to COVID-19-induced hospitalisation in oncohaematologic patients. Therefore, we have identified a cellular signature that even before vaccination is related to COVID-19 vulnerability as opposed to the acquisition of cellular and/or humoral memory following vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.">

        <tr id="Background
Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary, ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia, and other serious complications. Some populations have been observed to be at higher risk for severe disease and death compared to other ethnical groups.


Objective
To evaluate two parameters of the innate immune system, that play a significant role in viral immunity.


Methods
In samples of peripheral blood from sixteen patients with severe COVID-19, ten with asymptomatic to mild illness, and fifteen healthy subjects, the percentage of NK and NKT cells, the expression of different NK cell receptors and the blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were tested.


Results
We observed that patients with severe COVID-19 showed significantly lower frequencies of both CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells compared to patients with mild illness or healthy controls. Furthermore, patients with severe manifestation of COVID-19 exhibited an aberrant expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46. Similarly, NK cells from these patients showed statistically significant differences in the expression of various killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in the two main cell subsets (CD56bright, CD56dim) compared to controls or patients with mild disease. Moreover, patients with severe illness displayed decreased frequency of NKT cells (defined as CD3+CD56+) and elevated blood levels of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.


Conclusion
This study suggests that the abnormal features of NK and NKT cells observed in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may play an important role in the outcome of this infectious disease in various population groups.">

        <tr id="Sex differences have been observed in acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Long Covid (LC) outcomes, with greater disease severity and mortality during acute infection in males and greater proportions of females developing LC. We hypothesized that sex-specific immune dysregulation contributes to LC pathogenesis. To investigate the immunologic underpinnings of LC development and symptom persistence, we performed multiomic analyses on blood samples obtained during acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and 3 and 12 months after infection in a cohort of 45 participants who either developed LC or recovered. Several sex-specific immune pathways were associated with LC. Males who would later develop LC exhibited increases in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling during acute infection, whereas females who would go on to develop LC had reduced TGFB1 expression. Females who developed LC demonstrated increased expression of XIST, an RNA gene implicated in autoimmunity, during acute infection compared with females who recovered. Many immune features of LC were also conserved across sexes, such as alterations in monocyte phenotype and activation state. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors were up-regulated in many cell types at acute and convalescent time points. Those with ongoing LC demonstrated reduced ETS1 expression across lymphocyte subsets and elevated intracellular IL-4 in T cell subsets, suggesting that ETS1 alterations may drive aberrantly elevated T helper cell 2-like responses in LC. Altogether, this study describes multiple innate and adaptive immune correlates of LC, some of which differ by sex, and offers insights toward the pursuit of tailored therapeutics.">

        <tr id="In this study we tested the hypothesis that the immunosenescence profile could account for the disproportional susceptibility of the elderly to severe forms of COVID-19. The immunological profiles of volunteers residing in endemic and non-endemic areas for chronic infectious diseases were analyzed at early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A unique signature of inflammatory plasma mediators was identified in COVID-19 volunteers when compared to individuals with other flu-like syndromes. COVID-19 severity correlated with high levels of inflammatory mediators; among them, CXCL9, a serum marker of aging. Patients who progressed to hospitalization displayed high frequencies of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing exhaustion and senescence markers and showed reduced and more mature B cell repertoires, which are typical of senescence. They also had an acceleration of epigenetic age measured by DNA methylation. Therefore, severe COVID-19 correlated with phenotypic, functional, and epigenetic features of accelerated immunosenescence at onset of infection.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal brain tumor with a critical need for better therapies. It is known that the PI3K, MAPK, and CDK4/6 signaling pathways are hyper-activated in these tumors; however, previous studies have used very high concentration of inhibitors to assess their importance, with mixed results. Here we developed PMCi, a combination approach that targets all three pathways simultaneously, at clinically-relevant doses. PMCi effectively suppresses GBM cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and outperforms monotherapies and dual combinations. PMCi acts by inducing cellular senescence, which is mediated solely by the mitochondria, and, unlike other forms of senescence, is independent of nuclear damage. This phenotype is caused by a reactive oxygen species (ROS)\cGAS-STING\senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) signaling cascade, that acts in a paracrine manner to establish and maintain senescence. Our results demonstrate that mitochondrial damage is sufficient to drive senescence, and that this can be leveraged to target GBM cells.">

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) have become a significant healthcare burden. Sustained increases in prothrombotic markers have been reported in hospitalized acute COVID-19 patients. However, whether patients with less severe acute infection also endure a persistent prothrombotic state remains uncertain. We tested for a prothrombotic state in this cohort and examined potential mediators. We enrolled 70 adult patients with prior mild acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and sustained PASC symptoms (per WHO criteria). A control healthy group matched for age and sex was also enrolled who were not previously diagnosed with COVID-19. Markers of platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil aggregates (PNA) were quantified using whole-blood flow cytometry. Markers of extracellular traps (citrullinated histones [H3Cit] and cell-free DNA [cfDNA]), anti-dsDNA IgG, and thrombin generation potential were measured in plasma. At recruitment (6 weeks to 3 years post infection), there was increased potential for thrombin generation in the plasma from PASC compared to control reflected by increased peak and velocity index (P<0.001 vs. control). In whole blood, activation with thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) caused increased surface expression of P-selectin and activation of integrin αIIbβ3 in platelets (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively, vs. control). Concurrently, there was an increase in the PNA (P<0.01 vs. control). Plasma levels of H3Cit, cfDNA, as well as anti-dsDNA IgG were found to be elevated (P<0.0001 vs. control for all), suggesting not only an increase in extracellular trap, but also the existence of circulating immune complexes (ICs). While a histone-neutralizing aptamer inhibited P-selectin expression, αIIbβ3 activation, and PNA formation in whole blood, incubation of patient serum with anti-CD32, a FcγRIIa blocker (blocks the interaction of ICs with FcFcγRII on platelets), inhibited the activation of healthy platelets by patient sera. In conclusion, our study revealed a persistent prothrombotic state for months to years in patients who experienced mild acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Further, our data suggest that the activation of platelet is partly mediated by extracellular histones and ICs, such as anti-dsDNA antibodies. Our findings suggest a model in which extracellular traps activate platelets directly and indirectly through ICs. This study proposes novel therapeutic interventions targeting extracellular histones and ICs-Fcγ in PASC.">

        <tr id="Background: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most widespread mosquito-borne virus, which can cause dengue fever with mild symptoms, or progress to fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. As the main target cells of DENV, macrophages are responsible for the innate immune response against the virus. Methods: In this study, we investigated the role of pyroptosis in the pathogenic mechanism of dengue fever by examining the level of pyroptosis in DENV-1-infected macrophages and further screened differentially expressed microRNAs by high-throughput sequencing to predict microRNAs that could affect the pyroptosis of the macrophage. Results: Macrophages infected with DENV-1 were induced with decreased cell viability, decreased release of lactate dehydrogenase and IL-1β, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, cleavage of GSDMD to produce an N-terminal fragment bound to cell membrane, and finally induced macrophage pyroptosis. MicroRNA expression profiles were obtained by sequencing macrophages from all periods of DENV-1 infection and comparing with the negative control. Sixty-three microRNAs differentially expressed in both the early and later stages of infection were also identified. In particular, miR-223-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-146a-5p and miR-34a-5p were recognized as small molecules that may be involved in the regulation of inflammation. Conclusions: In summary, this study aimed to understand the pathogenic mechanism of DENV through relevant molecular mechanisms and provide new targets for dengue-specific therapy.">

        <tr id="Background Several years after the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of trained immunity in COVID-19 remains controversial, and questions regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19 on immune cells remain unresolved. We investigated the roles of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination and latent infections in the progression of COVID-19 and sepsis. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of 97 individuals recovering from mild-to-critical COVID-19 and 64 sepsis patients. Immune cell frequencies, expression of functional markers, and plasma titres of anti-Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies were assessed and their impact on disease severity and outcomes were determined. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS. Results Post COVID-19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterized mainly by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post-critical COVID-19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. Additionally, a higher frequency of CMV and T. gondii seropositive-alongside a lower frequency of BCG seropositive-patients were associated with severe and critical COVID-19. However, the monocyte response to stimulation was unaffected by the severity of COVID-19. Conclusion These findings highlight the long-term alterations of immune cells in post-COVID-19 patients emphasizing the substantial impact of COVID-19 on immune function. However, our data showed no relationship between previous BCG vaccination and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of ALI and COVID-19 lung injury and draws comparisons between the latter and other infectious etiologies of ALI. Indeed, severe COVID-19 is characterized by a unique array of disease mechanisms including suppression of interferon responses, widespread inflammasome activation, altered leukocyte phenotypes, and hyperactive thrombotic activity. Moreover, these mechanisms manifest as a unique clinical progression, which further differentiates COVID-19 from other viral respiratory pathogens such as SARS, MERS, and influenza. These unique features of COVID-19 pathophysiology bear important implications for current and future therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate genetic factors influencing the disease severity of the viral infection. Despite a plethora of recent research on both SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, few have taken a systems biology approach to address individual-level variation, especially based on non-European populations. Accordingly, we analyzed multi-omics data generated at three timepoints from 193 Korean COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms, composed of whole genome sequencing, blood-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (2.15M cells), 195 cytokine profiles, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele data. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), disease severity interacting eQTLs (n = 388), and disease progression interacting eQTLs (n = 945) for various cell types. We elucidated a complex regulatory mechanism involving HLA genes and their targets, and identified genetic determinants of cytokine levels. Finally, we show how regulation of ieQTLs is established by upstream transcription factors (TFs), illustrating complex regulation of the IGFBP7 ieQTL by a combined action of two TFs, which is potentially important in conferring differential severity. This study illuminates an efficient molecular interrogation framework that can be applied toward understanding infectious disease progression in individuals of different genotypes.">

        <tr id="Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) are critical challenges in lung transplantation. Dysregulated gene expression and epigenomic states in lung mesenchymal cells (MCs) play a key role in these conditions, but further work is needed to elucidate the biomarkers and molecular drivers. Single-cell multi-omic technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to address this gap by jointly measuring gene expression and chromatin accessibility in diseased and healthy cells. We performed single-cell multi-omic profiling and genetic demultiplexing on MCs isolated from human bronchoalveolar lavage samples of lung transplant recipients with CLAD and PGD, compared with time-matched controls. A classification model trained on these profiles classified the disease status of individual cells with > 98% accuracy using a small set of signature genes. We further identified 8 subtypes of MCs each characterized by distinct transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures, including a CLAD-enriched subtype and a PGD-enriched subtype. The CLAD-enriched subtype expresses markers of fibrosis, while the PGD-enriched subtype expresses pro-inflammatory genes. Finally, we used co-accessibility and co-expression to identify C/EBPD, SOX4, and FOXP2 as key regulators of the genes and chromatin accessibility peaks that are dysregulated in the CLAD-enriched cell population. Knocking down C/EBPD with siRNA partially reverted the CLAD gene expression signature, confirming the importance of this factor in the dysregulated molecular state of CLAD- associated MCs. Additional scRNA-seq analysis of MCs from human lung autopsy samples showed that cultured MCs retained key transcriptomic signatures from their in vivo counterparts. Sub-clustering analysis identified a CLAD-enriched MC sub-cluster with high C/EBPD expression, further linking these cells to the fibrotic state seen in vitro. Our results provide deeper insights into the transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in post-transplant MCs, nominating biomarkers and disease-associated factors with implications for future therapeutic efforts.">

 Background.
 Post-COVID syndrome is related to a multisystem disorder that affects in part the cardiovascular system. This disease involves symptoms, and conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection of immune and endothelial cells are associated with NETosis, microthrombosis and endothelial dysfunction that could persist several weeks after acute phase of infection. Damaged endothelial cells can expose the vessel pro-coagulant area leading to platelet and neutrophil clumps. Increased levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been described as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we hypothesize that CECs and microthrombosis are potential biomarkers of vascular dysfunction in Long COVID.


 Methods.
 A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Miami VA long COVID clinic. Long COVID cases and controls were recruited according to WHO definition for long COVID. A total of 23 patients and 7 controls were included in this study. Blood samples were collected in Heparin and Sodium Citrate tubes. Cell immunophenotyping and NETosis markers (MPO) were quantified on a Cytek Aurora spectral flow cytometer system. Microclots (CD62P
 +
 PAC-1
 +
 ) and platelet response were assessed by flow cytometry and response to Adenosine di-phosphate (ADP), respectively. A ttest was used for statistical analysis. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.


 Results.
 The age and gender were similar between cases and controls while their symptom score was significantly different. There was a significant increase in the number of CECs (CD31+CD309+CD45-CD133-) in Long COVID cases. MPO expression in neutrophils (CD11b
 +
 CD66b
 +
 CD15
 +
 ) and classical monocytes (CD14
 +
 CD16
 -
 ) was significantly higher in Long COVID. Microclots were significantly elevated, and the platelet aggregation response was dysregulated in Long COVID.


 Conclusions.
 CECs and microthrombosis including NETosis are present in Long COVID and may serve as potential biomarkers or causative mechanisms for vascular dysfunction.

Cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of mortality following infection. In this review, we discuss immune pathogenesis and four medications, including Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Dexamethasone, and Annual SZ for COVID-19. A comparison of the effectiveness and therapeutic usage of drugs as reported in clinical trials and reports was made at different disease levels as well. Clinical studies indicate that Annual SZ with mild side effects was more affordable and might be more effective than other medications. Additionally, Annual SZ was capable of reducing the lev-els of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as viral attachment and RNA replication.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: COVID-19 is characterised by a wide variety of clinical manifestations, and clinical tests and genetic analysis might help to predict patient outcomes. Methods: In the current study, the expression of genes related to immune response (CCL5, IFI6, OAS1, IRF9, IL1B, and TGFB1) was analysed in the upper airway and paired-blood samples from 25 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. Relative gene expression was determined by RT-qPCR. Results: CCL5 expression was higher in the blood than in the upper airway (p < 0.001). In addition, a negative correlation was found between IFI6 and viral load (p = 0.033) in the upper airway, suggesting that the IFI6 expression inhibits the viral infection. Concerning sex, women expressed IL1B and IRF9 in a higher proportion than men at a systemic level (p = 0.008 and p = 0.049, respectively). However, an increased expression of IRF9 was found in men compared to women in the upper airway (p = 0.046), which could be due to the protective effect of IRF9, especially in men. Conclusions: The higher expression of CCL5 in blood might be due to the key role of this gene in the migration and recruitment of immune cells from the systemic circulation to the lungs. Our findings confirm the existence of sex differences in the immune response to early stages of the infection. Further studies in a larger cohort are necessary to corroborate the current findings.">

        <tr id="Oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) are critical for neuronal support functions, including myelination and remyelination. Emerging evidence reveals their active roles in neuroinflammation, particularly in conditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study explores the inflammatory translatome of OLCs during the early onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an established MS model. Using RiboTag-based RNA sequencing in genetically modified Olig2-Cre RiboTag mice, we identified 1,556 upregulated and 683 downregulated genes in EAE OLCs. Enrichment analysis indicated heightened immune-related pathways, such as cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and antigen presentation, while downregulated genes were linked to neuronal development and myelination. Notably, OLCs expressed cytokines/chemokines, and their receptor, highlighting their active involvement in neuroinflammatory signaling. Functional studies demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling in OLCs exacerbates EAE pathology by enhancing antigen presentation and chemokine production, whereas interferon-beta (IFN-β) signaling showed minimal impact. These findings provide novel insights into the inflammatory role of OLCs in EAE and suggest therapeutic potential in targeting OLC-mediated neuroinflammation for MS and related disorders.">

        <tr id="Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are vectors for numerous arboviruses that have an increasingly substantial global health burden. Following a bloodmeal, mosquitoes experience significant physiological changes, primarily orchestrated by the midgut and fat body tissues. These changes begin with digestion and culminate in egg production. However, our understanding of those key processes at the cellular and molecular level remains limited. We have created a comprehensive cell atlas of the mosquito midgut and fat body by employing single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics techniques. This atlas unveils the dynamic cellular composition and metabolic adaptations that occur following a bloodmeal. Our analyses reveal highly diverse cell populations, specialized in digestion, metabolism, immunity, and reproduction. While the midgut primarily comprises enterocytes, enteroendocrine and intestinal stem cells, the fat body consists not only of trophocytes and oenocytes, but also harbors a substantial hemocyte population and a newly found fat body-yolk cell population. The fat body exhibits a complex cellular and metabolomic profile and exerts a central role in coordinating immune and metabolic processes. Additionally, an insect-specific virus, PCLV (Phasi Charoen-Like Virus) was detected in single cells, mainly in the midgut a week after the bloodmeal. These findings highlight the complexity of the mosquito’s abdominal tissues, and pave the way towards the development of exquisitely refined vector control strategies consisting of genetically targeting specific cell populations and metabolic pathways necessary for egg development after a bloodmeal.">

        <tr id="The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection is reported to begin with the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human body through droplets, entering the lungs, and binding to the ACE-2 receptor. Meanwhile, activated macrophages stimulate an immune and inflammatory response, activating the coagulation cascade. This activation in COVID-19 patients can exacerbate the condition and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The coagulation cascade is influenced by the expression of related genes, including F3, F5, F8, F12, F13A1, VWF, THBD, PROC, PROCR, PROS1, SERPINE1, A2M, and PLAUR. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022, with 22 mild COVID-19 cases, 35 moderate-to-severe cases, and 20 healthy control individuals from Dr. M. Djamil Padang General Hospital in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Coagulation gene expression data using the RNA-Seq method with transcriptomic analysis were collected and recorded in transcript per-million (TPM) units. The results showed a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes in moderate-to-severe compared to mild COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The analysis of log2 folds change has a statistically significant increase observed in the expression of coagulation genes and a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes among moderate-to-severe and mild patients, as well as healthy controls. The results underscored the impact of COVID-19 infection on the activity of coagulation cascade genes, which could influence the condition of patients and serve as a reference for therapy.">

We used virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice that express the wild-type human tau protein (htau mice). VLP exposure elicited dose-dependent changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings of primary somatosensory and motor cortex neurons that express the jGCaMP7s calcium sensor tracked modifications of neuronal activity patterns following exposure to VLPs. There was a substantial short-term increase in stimulus-evoked activity metrics in both WT and htau VLP-injected mice, while htau mice showed also increased spontaneous activity metrics and increase activity in the vehicle-injected group. Over the following weeks, activity metrics in WT mice subsided, but remained above baseline levels. For htau mice, activity metrics either remain elevated or decreased to lower levels than baseline. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. The htau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background, exhibited more severe pathobiology that may lead to more adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="Chronic viral infections are ubiquitous in humans, with individuals harboring multiple latent viruses that can reactivate during acute illnesses. Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood. Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence (≥3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue. Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID- 19 and PASC.">

        <tr id="Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a phenomenon in which antibodies enhance subsequent viral infections rather than preventing them. Sub-optimal levels of neutralizing antibodies in individuals infected with dengue virus are known to be associated with severe disease upon reinfection with a different dengue virus serotype. For Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type-2 infection, three types of ADE have been proposed: (1) Fc receptor-dependent ADE of infection in cells expressing Fc receptors, such as macrophages by anti-spike antibodies, (2) Fc receptor-independent ADE of infection in epithelial cells by anti-spike antibodies, and (3) Fc receptor-dependent ADE of cytokine production in cells expressing Fc receptors, such as macrophages by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. This review focuses on the Fc receptor-dependent ADE of cytokine production induced by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, examining its potential role in severe COVID-19 during reinfection and its contribution to the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, i.e., prolonged symptoms lasting at least three months after the acute phase of the disease. We also discuss the protective effects of recently identified anti-spike antibodies that neutralize Omicron variants.">

        <tr id="Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a concern for world health since it may impact both the upper (nose, throat, sinuses) and lower (trachea, lungs) respiratory tracts. Death (at a rate of 10%), respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are among the problems that might arise. Recent years have seen a global spread of zoonotic coronaviruses, which have caused human epidemics such as MERS and SARS. Various clinical symptoms may be seen in this sickness because to the numerous changes in intestinal homeostasis caused by SARS-CoV-2. Because of the beneficial impact that probiotics have on the host immune system, gastrointestinal disorders may now be effectively treated. This article discusses the close relationship between what we eat, the bacteria in our gut, and the risk of contracting the COV-19 virus. 
Conclusion: The relationship between gut microbiota, dietary factors, and COVID-19 severity indicates that the microbiome may influence immune regulation. Imbalances in microbial communities and reduced diversity can intensify inflammation, potentially worsening COVID-19 outcomes. Strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary changes might provide therapeutic benefits by improving gut health and strengthening immune defenses. However, further research is required to clarify these mechanisms and establish effective interventions.">

        <tr id="Chronic dysregulation of microglial phenotypic balance contributes to prolonged neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity, which is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, targeting microglial inflammatory signaling represents a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Regulator of G protein Signaling 10 (RGS10) is highly expressed in microglia, where it suppresses pro-inflammatory signaling. However, RGS10 is silenced following microglial activation, augmenting inflammatory responses. While modulating RGS10 expression is a promising strategy to suppress pro-inflammatory microglial activation, no chemical tools with this ability exist. We developed a phenotypic high-throughput assay to screen for compounds with the ability to reverse interferon-γ (IFNγ)-induced RGS10 silencing in BV-2 cells. Identified hits had no effect on RGS10 expression in the absence of stimulus or in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, the hits reversed some of the inflammatory gene expression induced by IFNγ. This is the first demonstration of the potential for small molecule intervention to modulate the RGS10 expression in microglia.">

        <tr id="During the COVID-19 pandemic, while most infected individuals experienced mild to moderate symptoms, a significant subset developed severe illness. A clinical test distinguishing between mild and severe cases could inform effective treatment strategies. Toward the latter stages of the pandemic, it became evident that vaccination or prior infection cannot entirely prevent reinfection. However, they are crucial in reducing the risk of severe disease by inducing T-cell memory. T cell receptors (TCRs), which can be obtained from human blood, serve as valuable biomarkers for monitoring T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we investigated the associations between TCR metrics and COVID-19 severity and found significant associations. Furthermore, such associations could depend on the subset of TCRs used (e.g., TCRs from CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells) and when the TCRs were collected.">

        <tr id="From December 2019 to March 2020, the human population faced a new coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, which led to global morbidity and high mortality worldwide. Typical features of coronavirus infection tended to resemble a seasonal infection over time. Despite this fact, it has been proven that, after acute disease, numerous disorders are detected in the patients, manifesting both with general health disturbances and as complications of pre-existing chronic diseases, including allergic syndrome. On the basis of these findings, the study of post-COVID syndrome became an important aspect of the ongoing COVID-19 research. It has been shown over recent decades that the number of people suffering from various types of allergic reactions is growing every year. Therefore, the studies in allergic pathology in the structure of post-COVID syndrome are among the most pressing issues. In addition to studying exacerbations of allergic reactions, a thorough analysis has shown that adverse reactions caused by coronavirus infection are viewed from new aspects, being characterized by functional disorders of acquired and innate immune response, causing increasingly severe consequences for the immune system and the whole body. Currently, the features of humoral immune response in post-COVID syndrome have not been sufficiently studied. In this respect, we have evaluated the features of humoral immunity in patients with post-COVID syndrome, with clinically confirmed allergic anamnesis. The study revealed changes in humoral immune system, indicating that the most significant changes are observed in post-COVID patients with a burdened history of allergies, thus requiring a more detailed study of immune status in order to develop an individualized approach to immunocorrection of these disorders in this group of patients.">

        <tr id="In clinical terms, chronic pain is the most prevalent sequela resulting from COVID-19, which is induced by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), while type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is the most common comorbidity. This triangular relationship can be attributed to the dysfunction of the insulin receptor signaling system (IRSS) in both central and peripheral systems. Patients with T2D are essentially more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the widespread expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in their pancreatic beta cells, which serves as the cellular port for the SARS-CoV-2 to infect and enter the cell. This infection can exacerbate chronic pain and insulin resistance for various reasons. Peripherally, once infected, the virus can cause damage to peripheral nerves and pancreatic β-cells, further exacerbating pain and glucose metabolism conditions. Additionally, in the central nervous system, dysfunctional IRSS is closely linked to chronic pain. Over the past few years of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing body of evidence suggests that insulin and other medications currently used in clinical practice for hyperglycemia control may not be safe for treating these patients. Therefore, we need a proper approach for the treatment of chronic pain in long COVID patients, especially patients with T2D. This review presents evidence that transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) may provide a viable treatment option for chronic pain and metabolic dysfunction by improving the function of IRSS in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Millions of individuals worldwide continue to experience symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and phenotype of multi-system symptoms attributed to Long COVID—including fatigue, pain, cognitive-emotional disturbances, headache, cardiopulmonary issues, and alterations in taste and smell—that have persisted for at least two years after acute infection, which we define as “persistent Long COVID”. Additionally, the study aimed to identify clinical features and blood biomarkers associated with persistent Long COVID symptoms. Methods: We sent a detailed long COVID symptoms questionnaire to an existing cohort of 1258 vaccinated adults (age 18–79 years) who had mild infection (e.g., non-hospitalized) SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant 2 years earlier. These individuals had comprehensive datasets, including blood samples, available for further analysis. We estimated prevalence of persistent long COVID two years post-infection using weighted adjustment (Horvitz–Thompson estimator) to overcome reporting bias. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine association of clinical features and blood biomarkers (pre-infection SARS-CoV-2 RBD-IgG, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, and pre-infection and post-infection neurofilament light) with prevalence of persistent long COVID. Results: N = 323 participants responded to the survey, of whom N = 74 (23%) reported at least one long COVID symptom that had persisted for two years after the acute infection. Weighted prevalence of persistent long COVID symptoms was 21.5% (95% CI = 16.7–26.3%). Female gender, smoking, and severity of acute COVID-19 infection were significantly associated with persistent Long COVID. The blood biomarkers assessed were not significantly associated with persistent Long COVID. Conclusions: Among vaccinated adults two years after mild infection with Delta variant SARS-CoV-2, persistent symptoms attributed to Long COVID are extremely common, certain subgroups are at higher risk, and further research into biological mechanisms and potential treatment targets is needed.">

        <tr id="Persistent Covid (PC) represents a post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by symptoms that persist for more than 12 weeks after the acute phase. These symptoms, which include chronic fatigue, respiratory distress, cognitive dysfunction, and other multisystem effects, significantly impact the quality of life of the affected individuals. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood, although studies have suggested a multifactorial origin. Proposed factors include viral persistence, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation disturbances, and gut dysbiosis. The identification of these mechanisms could facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, opening new perspectives for the effective management of persistent Covid. The diagnosis of PC is complex due to the diversity of symptoms and the lack of specific biomarkers. At present, therapeutic approaches focus primarily on symptomatic relief, but further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying PC and to develop targeted interventions.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT A consistent feature of lung injury is a rapid and sustained accumulation of hyaluronan (HA). The rodent gut‐dwelling nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) induces tissue damage as it migrates through the lungs. Type 2 immune responses are essential for the repair of the lungs, hence Nb infection is a well‐established model to study immune‐mediated lung repair. We found that Nb infection was associated with increased HA in the lung, which peaked at d7 post‐infection (p.i.). Deposition of HA in the alveolar epithelium correlated with regions of damaged tissue and the type 2 immune response, which is characterized by eosinophilia and increased type 2 cytokines such as IL‐13. Consistent with the accumulation of HA, we observed increased expression of the major synthase Has2, alongside decreased expression of Hyal1, Hyal2, and Tmem2, which can degrade existing HA. Expression of Tsg6 was also increased and correlated with the presence of inter‐α‐inhibitor heavy chain–HA complexes (HC·HA) at d7 p.i. Using IL‐13‐deficient mice, we found that the accumulation of HA during Nb infection was IL‐13 dependent. Our data thus provide further evidence that IL‐13 is a modulator of the HA matrix during lung challenge and links IL‐13‐mediated HA regulation to tissue repair pathways.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Hericium erinaceus mycelium and its constituents, erinacines A and S, have shown neuroprotective effects in APP/PS1 transgenic mice; however, the precise mechanisms by which they modulate microglial phenotypes remain unclear. Our study is the first to explore the effect of erinacines on microglia morphology and the underlying mechanisms using a novel primary mixed glia cell model and advanced bioinformatic tools. Furthermore, we emphasize the clinical relevance by evaluating erinacines in a metabolically stressed APP/PS1 mouse model, which more accurately reflects the complexities of human Alzheimer's disease (AD), where metabolic syndrome is a common comorbidity. Methods Rat primary mixed glial cultures were used to simulate the spectrum of microglial phenotypes, particularly the transition from immature to mature states. Microarray sequencing, along with Connectivity Map, ConsensusPathDB, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, identified pathways influenced by erinacines. The therapeutic efficacy was further evaluated in metabolically stressed APP/PS1 mice. Results Erinacines significantly promoted the development of a ramified, neuroprotective microglial phenotype. Bioinformatics revealed potential modulation of microglia via histone deacetylase inhibition, actin filament dynamics, and synaptic structure modification—pathways not previously linked to erinacines in AD. Importantly, erinacines significantly lower fasting blood glucose and insulin levels while reducing amyloid‐beta plaque burden, suppressing hyperactivated glial responses, and enhancing neurogenesis in the metabolically stressed APP/PS1 mice. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate the dual action of erinacines in modulating microglia morphology and phenotype while providing neuroprotection in a model that closely mimic the complexities of human Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, this study provides the foundation for understanding the potential mechanisms of action of erinacines, highlighting their promise as a novel treatment approach for Alzheimer's, particularly in cases complicated by metabolic dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making them a significant public health concern. During infection, respiratory viruses, including Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), trigger an antiviral immune response, specifically boosting the inflammatory response that plays a critical role in their pathogenesis. The inflammatory response induced by respiratory viruses can be a double-edged sword since it can be initially induced to be antiviral and protective/reparative from virus-induced injuries. Still, it can also be detrimental to host cells and tissues. However, the mechanisms that differentiate the complex crosstalk between favorable host inflammatory responses and harmful inflammatory responses are poorly understood. This review explores the complex interplay between viral pathogens and the host immune response, mainly focusing on the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of VRIs. We discuss how inflammation can both contain and exacerbate the progression of viral infections, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and emerging drugs for modulating the aberrant inflammatory responses during VRIs.">

        <tr id="The complex link between COVID-19 and immunometabolic diseases demonstrates the important interaction between metabolic dysfunction and immunological response during viral infections. Severe COVID-19, defined by a hyperinflammatory state, is greatly impacted by underlying chronic illnesses aggravating the cytokine storm caused by increased levels of Pro-inflammatory cytokines. Metabolic reprogramming, including increased glycolysis and altered mitochondrial function, promotes viral replication and stimulates inflammatory cytokine production, contributing to illness severity. Mitochondrial metabolism abnormalities, strongly linked to various systemic illnesses, worsen metabolic dysfunction during and after the pandemic, increasing cardiovascular consequences. Long COVID-19, defined by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, poses continuous problems, highlighting the need for comprehensive therapy solutions that address both immunological and metabolic aspects. Understanding these relationships shows promise for effectively managing COVID-19 and its long-term repercussions, which is the focus of this review paper.">

        <tr id="CNS-resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells populate the haematoma in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), but the contribution of these cell populations to injury and repair has been controversial. To better characterise myeloid cell changes over time, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a unique paired dataset of live haematoma and peripheral blood samples from 10 ICH patients. This work presents a temporal atlas of ICH myeloid populations and identifies population-specific in-situ transcriptional drivers. In addition to distinct populations of activated microglia and TNF-low microglia, we found a unique and highly activated population of CD14+ monocytes in the haematoma. Perturbation analysis comparing haematoma-associated monocytes to shared populations in blood and haematomas identified TNF signalling as the primary driver of their activation. Employing a custom temporal trajectory analysis based on the embeddings of a single-cell foundation model, we found that this TNF response in monocytes was transient, peaking early after haemorrhage and decreasing over the ensuing 48 hours. Our analysis further identified a transient population of highly activated microglia as the likely source of TNF during the acute stage of ICH. Acute TNF signalling in CD14+ monocytes associated with better adjusted outcomes both in our and external cohorts. Overall, our results suggest that acute TNF signalling between transient populations of activated microglia and unique haematoma-associated monocytes could potentially be beneficial in recovery after ICH. One sentence summary We present a single-cell temporal atlas of myeloid cells in intracerebral haemorrhage and identify TNF signalling as a driver of haematoma dynamics.">

        <tr id="Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease with high prevalence, making it one of the most common chronic conditions worldwide. Its pathophysiology is influenced by a range of genetic and environmental factors, resulting in a complex and heterogeneous disease profile. Asthma is primarily associated with a type 2 (T2) immune response, though non-T2 endotypes also contribute to disease pathology. Generally, asthma is characterized by the infiltration and activation of various cell types, including dendritic cells, eosinophils, innate lymphoid cells, lymphocytes, mast cells, and neutrophils, which participate in T1, T2, and T17 immune responses. Despite advances in understanding, many questions remain unresolved. Therefore, emerging omic techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), offer novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of asthma and the roles of these immune cells. Recent scRNA-seq studies in asthma have identified multiple novel immune cell subtypes and clusters, suggesting their potential functions in disease pathology. The rapid advancement of scRNA-seq technology now enables in-depth investigation of individual cells within tissues, allowing for precise cell-type classification and detailed molecular profiling. Nonetheless, certain limitations persist, which require further refinement in future studies.">

        <tr id="To date, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) remains unclear. Despite this, it becomes obvious that the pathogenesis of MIS-C is directly related to a certain immune dysregulation, however, a clear understanding of the mechanisms of this dysregulation has not yet been formulated. In order to identify the cytokine profile in patients with MIS-C, spontaneous and stimulated production of certain cytokines in cell culture was identified. Materials and methods. The study was conducted in the following study groups: group 1 — patients with MIS-C (n = 52); group 2 (comparison group) — patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia (n = 15); group 3 (control group) — conditionally healthy patients (n = 23). The following stimulating agents were used: S58 — recombinant antigen Spike_SARS-Cov-2; NP is a recombinant NP antigen of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and a standard mitogen. Results. Тhe absence of the initially expected hyperproduction of the main pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, etc.) was recorded. Statistically significant developments were recorded between patients of the study groups in the spontaneous production of MCP-1, in particular, the indicated indicator was 40010.82 (19698.1; 64812.1); 643.7 (214.6; 1695.4) and 622.7 (214.6; 1068.1), respectively. The indicated spontaneous hyperproduction of MCP-1 in patients with MIS-C allows us to consider as a probable completely new theory of the pathogenesis of MIS-C associated with dysregulation of the type 2 immune response. The presence of statistically significant differences, primarily in the spontaneous production of this cytokine, can apparently be explained by the presence of genetically determined determinants associated with subsequent dysfunction of the Th2 helper immune response, a potential trigger for which is a previous COVID-19 infection. Thus, further study of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 associated MIS-C is required.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute infectious disease represents a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in elderly individuals admitted to the hospital. In its extreme, it presents as sepsis, a systematic inflammatory and immunologic response responsible for self-injurious organ injury. As individuals age, a unique set of factors including immunosenescence predispose them to acquiring an infection and a worse clinical prognosis. This systematic review explores the relationship between cellular senescence, an age-related inflammatory phenomenon, with acute human infectious disease. Methods Embase via OVID, Scopus, Web of Science, Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Library via Wiley, and ClinicalTrials.gov were queried. Included studies must have compared at least one of the following measures of cellular senescence between patients with an infection and without an infection: cell cycle inhibition measured via levels of p16 INK4a and/or p21 CIP1 , short telomere length, DNA damage via ɣH2AX, high senescence-associated β galactosidase activity, and inflammation via the detection of senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Manuscripts were screened and data collected via two independent reviewers. Results A total of 15,828 studies were screened after duplicates were removed. One hundred and fifty-three full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and a total of 16 original articles were included in analysis. Of the 16 original articles included, 12 (75%) articles were centered on SARS-CoV-2, 2 (12.5%) articles utilized patients infected with Leishmania braziliensis, 1 (6.25%) with Plasmodium falciparum, and 1 (6.25%) with Hepatitis C. Conclusion Current literature demonstrates robust upregulation of markers of cellular senescence in the setting of acute SARS-CoV-2, P. falciparum, L. braziliensis, and hepatitis C virus, and that markers of senescence correlate with disease severity and persist for months after resolution. Limitations in the number and types of infectious organisms studied, low sample sizes, modest longitudinal sampling, and a lack of consistency in markers measured, the method of measurement, and the definition of normal values represent ongoing gaps in the literature.

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of long COVID (LC) still presents many areas of uncertainty. This leads to difficulties in finding an effective specific therapy. We hypothesize that the key to LC pathogenesis lies in the presence of chronic functional damage to the main anti-inflammatory mechanisms of our body: the three reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis, and the mitochondrial redox status. We will illustrate that this neuro-endocrine-metabolic axis is closely interconnected and how the SARS-CoV-2 can damage it at all stages through direct, immune-inflammatory, epigenetic damage mechanisms, as well as through the reactivation of neurotropic viruses. According to our theory, the direct mitochondrial damage carried out by the virus, which replicates within these organelles, and the cellular oxidative imbalance, cannot be countered in patients who develop LC. This is because their anti-inflammatory mechanisms are inconsistent due to reduced vagal tone and direct damage to the endocrine glands of the HPA axis. We will illustrate how acetylcholine (ACh) and cortisol, with its cytoplasmatic and cellular receptors respectively, are fundamental players in the LC process. Both Ach and cortisol play multifaceted and synergistic roles in reducing inflammation. They achieve this by modulating the activity of innate and cell-mediated immunity, attenuating endothelial and platelet activation, and modulating mitochondrial function, which is crucial for cellular energy production and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In our opinion, it is essential to study the sensitivity of the glucocorticoids receptor in people who develop LC and whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause long-term epigenetic variations in its expression and function.">

        <tr id="Interest to the topic of coronavirus infection remains unabated. At the same time, there is insufficient information in the literature on the clinical course of COVID-19 in systemic sclerosis (SSc), a systemic autoimmune disease associated with high mortality.Objective: to identify the characteristics of coronavirus disease in SSc and risk factors for severe COVID-19 and death.Material and methods. A retrospective analysis of data from patients with SSc was performed. The analyzed cohort included patients from the registry of the Systemic Sclerosis Laboratory of V.A. Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology. Information about the history of novel coronavirus infection was obtained by telephone interview 10 months after the outbreak of the pandemic. COVID-19 was diagnosed if there was a positive oral cavity/nasopharynx PCR swab, if antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were present and/or characteristic symptoms and computed tomography (CT) changes in the lungs were present.Results and discussion. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 57 (52%) patients with SSc. Their median age was 58 [31; 79] years. The majority were women (n=48, 84%) with a limited form of SSc (n=37, 65%). Fifteen (26%) patients had diffuse, 4 (7%) had overlapping (SSc-polymyositis and SSc-rheumatoid arthritis) and 1 (2%) had visceral SSc. Almost 2/3 (74%) of patients with COVID-19 had SSc associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD), with 40% of them having >20% lung parenchymal involvement.All patients received low-dose prednisone therapy, 95% received immunosuppressive therapy and in half of the cases mycophenolate mofetil; rituximab was used in 40% of patients.Chest CT scan was performed in 51 (89%) patients. Pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection was detected in 46 (90%) of them: CT1 (up to 25% lung involvement) – in 10 (20%), CT2 (25–50% involvement) – in 21 (41%) and CT3 (50–75% involvement) – in 15 (29%); in 5 (10%) cases no changes were detected on CT.Mild and moderate course of the viral infection was observed in 19 (33%) and 18 (32%) patients respectively, severe infection – in 20 (35%), including fatal cases in 12 (21%).Conclusion. Patients with SSc infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of severe coronavirus infection, often due to the association of the underlying disease with ILD and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, including biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. In case of COVID-19 development the high incidence of cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities that characterize SSc may contribute to a decrease in the efficacy of therapy for both the underlying disease and coronavirus infection, generally worsening the prognosis in these patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous, ranging from cases with mild disease with an almost asymptomatic carrier to severe cases, in which the disease evolves rapidly. A better understanding of monocyte response during SARS-CoV-2 infection would highlight potential biomarkers and establish other possible approaches for severe cases. Methods The study group consisted of 32 COVID-19 patients and 18 health controls from June 2023 to March 2024. The COVID-19 patients were further classified as mild and severe illnesses based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. For flow cytometric analysis, 50 µL of peripheral blood and 1 µL of specific monoclonal antibodies were added to each cytometric tube for surface marker detection. Results Here, the promising finding was that the blood non-classical/classical monocyte (NC/CL) subset was skewed toward NChighCLlow and NClowCLhigh clusters among the severe COVID-19 patients. The NChighCLlow cluster in severe COVID-19 displayed a distinct clinical phenotype, implying a higher 7-day disease progression rate (p = 0.019) and a worse 28-day survival (p = 0.026). Moreover, the secretion of IL-1β and IFN-γ was primarily attributed to CL subset in monocytes, while IL-6 was secreted mainly by NC subset. Conclusion As supported, regarding cytokine profile in context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it was identified that circulating NC cells are proinflammatory cells most related to regulatory cells, while CL subset displayed an effective capacity to virus. These findings have implications toward optimizing evaluation in severe COVID-19, and developing strategies that target altered balance of NC/CL cell subsets.">

Coronaviruses are well-known to have a negative impact on the lungs and cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 induces a cytokine storm that primarily targets the lungs, causing widespread clinical disorders, including COVID-19. Although, SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals often show no or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Novel CoV-2 infection in 2019 resulted in viral pneumonia as well as other complications and extrapulmonary manifestation. ARDS is also linked to a higher risk of death. Now, it is essential to develop our perception of the long term sequelae coronavirus infection for the identification of COVID-19 survivors who are at higher risk of developing the chronic lung fibrosis. This review study was planned to provide an overview of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on various parts of the respiratory system such as airways, pulmonary vascular, lung parenchymal and respiratory neuromuscular system as well as the potential mechanism of the ARDS related respiratory complications including the lung fibrosis in patients with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The Flaviviridae are a family of viruses that include the important arthropod-borne human pathogens dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus. Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is essential for virus replication but is also secreted from virus-infected cells. Extracellular NS1 acts as a virulence factor during flavivirus infection in multiple ways, including triggering endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak via interaction with endothelial cells. While the role of NS1 in inducing vascular leak and exacerbating pathogenesis is well appreciated, if and how NS1-triggered endothelial dysfunction promotes virus infection remains obscure. Flaviviruses have a common need to disseminate from circulation into specific tissues where virus-permissive cells reside. Tissue-specific dissemination is associated with disease manifestations of a given flavivirus, but mechanisms dictating virus dissemination are unclear. Here we show that NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction promotes virus dissemination in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models of DENV infection, we show that anti-NS1 antibodies decrease virus dissemination, while the addition of exogenous NS1 promotes virus dissemination. Using an in vitro system, we show that NS1 promotes virus dissemination in two distinct ways: (1) promoting crossing of barriers and (2) increasing infectivity of target cells in a tissue- and virus-specific manner. The capacity of NS1 to modulate infectivity correlates with a physical association between virions and NS1, suggesting a potential NS1-virion interaction. Taken together, our study indicates that flavivirus NS1 promotes virus dissemination across endothelial barriers, providing an evolutionary basis for virus-triggered vascular leak. Author Summary The Flaviviridae contain numerous medically important human pathogens that cause potentially life-threatening infections. Over half of the world’s population is at risk of flavivirus infection, and this number is expected to increase as climate change expands the habitats of the arthropod vectors that transmit these flaviviruses. There are few effective vaccines and no therapeutics approved for prevention or treatment of flavivirus infection, respectively. Given these challenges, understanding how and why flaviviruses cause pathogenesis is critical for identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. The secreted nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of flaviviruses is a conserved virulence factor that triggers endothelial dysfunction in a tissue-specific manner. It is unknown if this endothelial dysfunction provides any benefit for virus infection. Here we provide evidence that NS1-triggered endothelial dysfunction facilitates virus crossing of endothelial barriers and augments infection of target cells in vitro and promotes virus dissemination in vivo. This study provides an evolutionary explanation for flaviviruses evolving the capacity to trigger barrier dysfunction and highlights NS1 and the pathways governing endothelial dysfunction, as therapeutic targets to prevent flavivirus dissemination.">

Although SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been responsible for pneumonia,
recent studies indicate that it also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain, among other vital organs.
Evidence suggests that this virus may travel retrogradely from the olfactory epithelium to brain
stem sections, causing neurological impairments in a significant number of individuals. Individuals
with severe COVID-19 frequently have elevated cytokines that promote inflammation and acute
respiratory failure and require frequent supportive ventilation. These factors are believed to contribute
to cognitive deterioration. Severe neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients include- paralysis,
stroke, cranial nerve deficits, delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, and meningitis. The virus, with
its unique structure, and a high binding affinity for the human enzyme ACE2 (used as an entry point
by the virus), contributes significantly to its deadly nature. Furthermore, to address the outbreak effectively,
researchers worldwide must develop precise treatment strategies. Advancing new diagnostic
and treatment methods to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on cognition requires further
epidemiological research and clinical experience. Additionally, by understanding the virus's
impact on cognitive functions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted treatments to alleviate
these severe neurological consequences.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection poses a significant global health threat, yet our understanding of its immunopathogenesis remains incomplete due to limitations of existing models. Here, we establish an in vitro whole-blood model using hirudin, an anticoagulant that preserves complement activity and cellular interactions, to study DENV infection. Our model reveals the susceptibility of all major leukocyte populations to DENV infection, with monocytes and granulocytes demonstrating high permissiveness and production of infectious virus progeny. Notably, granulocytes emerge as previously unrecognized targets of DENV infection, highlighting the importance of studying viral tropism within a physiologically relevant context. We also observed efficient DENV binding to B cells, but limited production of infectious virus, suggesting a potential role in viral sequestration or immune dysregulation. Interestingly, both NK and T cells, while less permissive, were also found to be susceptible to DENV infection. Our ex vivo analysis of whole blood from DENV-infected patients confirms the susceptibility of granulocytes, monocytes, B cells, natural killer cells, and T cells to infection, further validating the clinical relevance of our model. Additionally, we observed dynamic changes in circulating blood cell populations during acute dengue, potentially reflecting both direct virus-mediated effects and immune responses. This whole-blood model offers a valuable tool for investigating the complex interplay between DENV and host factors, facilitating a deeper understanding of dengue pathogenesis and ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a significant global health threat, with increasing incidence in endemic regions and expanding geographic range due to factors like global warming. Current models for studying DENV pathogenesis often lack the complexity of the human immune system, hindering the development of effective therapies and vaccines. To address this, we have established the first in vitro whole-blood model using hirudin, preserving critical immune components and cellular interactions. This model reveals granulocytes as previously unrecognized targets of productive DENV infection, challenging existing paradigms of viral tropism. Our ex vivo analysis of patient blood samples confirms the clinical relevance of this finding and validates our model’s utility. This unique model offers a powerful platform for future studies to dissect the complex interactions between DENV and the host immune system, including the roles of different leukocyte populations, ultimately informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this devastating disease.">

        <tr id="A positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that devastated the world. While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID- 19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), belonging to the Flaviviridae family, has been a severe threat to human health since the worldwide outbreak. ZIKV is capable of inducing fetal microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other serious neurological complications. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) is a key member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, functioning in selective mRNA splicing and gene expression regulation. Our previous study has indicated that the expression of PTBP1 increases in astrocytes upon ZIKV infection, yet the precise regulatory mechanisms underlying its role in viral replication remain elusive. In this study, we elucidated the specific pathway by which ZIKV upregulates PTBP1 expression through the activation of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression. Further investigation revealed that overexpression of PTBP1 effectively inhibits viral replication, whereas knockdown of PTBP1 significantly enhances viral replication. Mechanistically, using co-immunoprecipitation assays for protein interaction screening, we identified an interaction between PTBP1 and ZIKV non-structural protein NS1. Detailed studies demonstrated that PTBP1 bound and colocalized with NS1 to lead to the degradation of NS1 protein via a lysosomal pathway. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel mechanism underlying that ZIKV infection induces the expression of PTBP1 via the HIF-1α pathway, subsequently the accumulated PTBP1 binds to ZIKV NS1 protein to promote NS1 degradation, thereby effectively inhibiting viral replication. The study illustrates a distinct restricted cellular factor that regulates ZIKV replication, which provides a potential target for the control of the viral replication and pathogenesis during the ZIKV epidemic. Importance Since the outbreak of ZIKV infection among human in 2014, a Zika epidemic has caused Zika fever accompanied with fetal microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neurological symptoms. Emerging evidence reveals that ZIKV infects astrocytes to specially induce the expression of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), one of hnRNPs members. However, the interplay between PTBP1 and ZIKV replication is highly concerned. Here, we uncover a distinct manner that ZIKV infection induces PTBP1 expression through the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signal. Additionally, activation of HIF-1α signal hinders ZIKV replication relying on PTBP1 accumulation. Further investigations suggest that PTBP1 restrains ZIKV replication by interacting with ZIKV NS1 protein, thereby leading to the degradation of NS1 protein via a lysosomal pathway. Collectively, our findings illustrate a novel restricted cellular factor PTBP1 mediated by HIF-1α that regulates ZIKV replication, which provides a potential therapeutic target of the viral replication and pathogenesis against ZIKV pandemic.">

        <tr id="The heart is a key target organ in SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the illness stage of acute Covid-19, fibrin thrombi frequently form within the coronary microcirculation, including the vasa vasorum. These thrombi are predominantly located in the abluminal spaces, the sites of pericyte location, of the vessel wall, in both the microvascular and epicardial vessels. A hallmark histopathological finding is the presence of diffuse, focal fibrin deposits surrounding myocardial fibres, which exhibit varying degrees of degeneration and atrophy. This process contributes to myocardial injury, which is reflected both biochemically and clinically in the acute and long-term phases of Covid-19. Myocardial fibrosis results from this pathological cascade, without a concurrent cellular inflammatory response associated with the myocardial stromal fibrin deposits. During the convalescent stage of acute Covid-19, focal myocardial fibrosis and the presence of thrombi within myocardial vessels remain apparent but sparse. Vascular changes, such as fibrin thrombi within the cardiac microcirculation, exhibit similarities to those observed in the pulmonary microcirculation in Covid-19.
In Covid-19, the vascular findings of fibrin thrombi deposits within the cardiac micro vascular circulation are like those seen within the pulmonary microcirculation. ">

        <tr id="The development of new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic potential of microvascular endothelium. A specific feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the post-COVID syndrome that is characterised by long-term impairment of various organs and systems. The immune pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis requires special attention due to their baseline pro-inflammatory status. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of novel coronavirus infection on the risk of chronic systemic hyper-inflammation and low-grade systemic inflammation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Two main groups consisted of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had survived COVID-19 (mild form) 3 months ago, or at earlier terms, including the subjects with post-COVID symptoms and those free of these symptoms. The comparison group included patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without a history of COVID-19. The control group was presented by healthy blood donors. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFá), D-dimers, troponin I, cortisol, and endothelin I (ET-I) were measured in patients’ plasma by immunoassay technique. On the basis of these markers, we calculated integral indices of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) – the levels of reactivity (RL), and chronic systemic hyper-inflammation (ChSI). Low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) was diagnosed in absence of ChSI, but in cases of simultaneous increase of D-dimer levels 250 ng/ml and ET-I levels 90 pg/ml in the patient. 
The most prevalent symptoms of post-COVID in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were tachycardia, arthralgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, which correspond to the population-wide data. By all empirical parameters, the groups of tuberculosis patients were comparable to each other (p 0.05) and significantly differed from control group. However, evaluation of integral indexes is more crucial for assessing the ‘systemic’ origin of the process. Thus, 23-50% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed subcritical SIR (RL = 1-2), being a feature of ChSI in 7.1-13.6% of cases (both in COVID-19 reconvalescents and non-COVID-19 patients). Meanwhile, all patient groups did not show significant difference in the frequency of LGSI and endothelial dysfunction (p 0.05). However, there was a trend towards an increase of these scores in the following sequence: tuberculosis without COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 + post-COVID syndrome. 
Most patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are not characterized by the development of chronic systemic hyperinflammation. LGSI is the most probable feature of general pathology in tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis infection sufficiently contributes to the development of LGSI, since the frequency and severity of LGSI and its individual manifestations are independent on the new coronavirus infection and signs of post-COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="Controlled activation of macrophages to achieve desired phenotypes in vivo and in vitro could lead to possible treatments for several inflammatory and proliferative diseases. This investigation uniquely established that dengue protease enhances the polarization and activation of human and murine macrophages following extracellular exposure. It was observed that macrophages have a robust response to extracellularly administered purified dengue NS2B/NS3 protease; it stimulated the macrophages in classical M1 directions and enhanced both the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). The cells exhibited an increase in the intracellular levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ and an elevation of phosphorylated versions of Akt, P38 MARK, SAPK, and ERK. In tandem, this investigation also established that the heightened responses of stimulated cells were associated with an increase in the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB (P65) protein. The cell viability assay showed that NS2B/NS3 protease exerts no major toxic effect on macrophages after 24 hours of treatment, even at a dosage (20 μg/ml) which was four times higher than the effective dose (5 μg/ml). Remarkably, we also observed that the native form of the viral protease, which drives its enzyme activities, had no bearing on the antigenic qualities of the enzyme. Thus, our study highlighted the efficacy of dengue viral NS2B/NS3 protease as a non-toxic ex vivo macrophage activating/polarizing agent and may serve a vital role in macrophage-based cell therapy in the near future.">

        <tr id="Severe asthma in children is notoriously difficult to treat, and its immunopathogenesis is complex. In particular, the contribution of T cells and relationships to anti-viral immunity, remain enigmatic. Here, we coupled deep phenotyping with machine learning methods to resolve the dynamics of T cells in the diseased lower airways, and examined rhinovirus (RV) as a driver. Our strategy revealed a T-cell landscape dominated by type 1 and type 17 CD8+ signatures. Interrogation of phenotypic relationships coupled with trajectory mapping identified T-cell migratory and differentiation pathways spanning the blood and airways that culminated in tissue residency, and included transitions between type 1 and type 17 tissue-resident types. These T-cell dynamics were reflected in cytokine polyfunctionality in situ. Use of machine learning to cross-compare T-cell populations that were enriched in the airways of RV-positive children with those induced in the blood after RV challenge in an experimental infection model, precisely pinpointed RV-responsive signatures that mapped to T-cell differentiation pathways. Despite their rarity, these signatures were detected in the airways of uninfected children. Together, our results underscore the aberrant nature of type 1 immunity in the airways of children with severe asthma, and implicate an important viral trigger as a driver.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of Lassa fever has not yet been fully deciphered, particularly as concerns the mechanisms determining whether acute infection is controlled or leads to catastrophic illness and death. Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus (LASV) infection reproducing the different outcomes of the disease, we performed histological and transcriptomic studies to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity, with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever. By contrast, the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response, is associated with a fatal outcome.

        <tr id="Rabies virus (RABV) proteins play dual roles during the infection of complex neural tissue, the generation and spread of new virions and the active inhibition of cellular innate immune pathways, both contributing to rabies’ lethality. While spatially-distinct RABV protein residues specializing in virus-centric and immune-inhibitory functions have been identified, how these dual functions interact to shape infection outcomes across diverse types of host brain cells is unknown. To “unmask” and study how innate immune inhibition affects the transcriptional regulation of the human and viral genome with cellular resolution, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of co-cultured human brain cell types, comparing infection dynamics of a wild-type RABV isolate virus to a mutant virus in which six critical point mutations in the phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M) RABV proteins selectively neuter antagonism of interferon- and NF-κB- dependent cellular responses. Our analysis reveals that RABV gene expression is shaped by host cell type and that wild-type RABV infection induces small-scale, cell-type conserved transcriptional programs that may support infection by hijacking transcriptional feedback systems that control pro-viral host cell factors while minimizing anti-viral responses. In contrast to accepted models, disinhibited innate immune signaling increases RABV transcriptional output across infected cell types. Most strikingly, we discovered a subpopulation of astrocytes that supports an average of 6-fold higher viral mRNA expression through a massive host cell transcriptional change involving ∼38% of astrocyte expressed genes. Our analysis suggests that these astrocytes we term “pro-viral” are a rare subtype present in the human brain and are primed to play a protective role during viral infection in concert with interferon-sensitive microglia recalcitrant to infection.">

        <tr id="Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are genomic fragments integrated into human DNA from germline infections by exogenous retroviruses that threatened primates early in their evolution and are inherited vertically in the germline. So far, HERVs have been studied in the context of extensive immunopathogenic, neuropathogenic and even oncogenic effects within their host. In particular, in our paper, we elaborate on the aspects related to the possible correlation of transposable HERV elements’ activation and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s presence in cells of COVID-19 patients or upon COVID-19 vaccination with implications for natural and adaptive immunity. In particular, the release of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 occurs in such cases and plays a notable role in sustaining chronic inflammation. Moreover, well-known interindividual variations of HERVs might partially account for the interpersonal variability of COVID-19 symptoms or unwanted events post-vaccination. Accordingly, further studies are required to clarify the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s role in triggering HERVs.">

        <tr id="Introduction Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a predominant subset of innate-like T cells in humans, characterized by diverse gene expression profiles and functional capabilities. However, the factors influencing the transcriptomes and effector functions of MAIT cells, particularly at mucosal barriers, remain largely unclear. Methods In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and functional assays to investigate the transcriptomic and functional characteristics of intestinal MAIT cells in mouse models during aging. We also extended scRNA-seq analysis to human intestinal MAIT cells to compare their gene expression patterns with those observed in aged mice. Results Our findings demonstrated that the transcriptomes and functional capabilities of intestinal MAIT cells shifted from MAIT17 to MAIT1 profiles with aging in mouse models, with notable changes in the production of cytotoxic molecules. Further scRNA-seq analysis of human intestinal MAIT cells revealed a segregation into MAIT1 and MAIT17 subsets, displaying gene expression patterns that mirrored those seen in aged mouse models. The transcription factor RORγt was expressed in both MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, acting to repress IFNγ production while promoting IL17 expression. Moreover, reduced expression of RORC and Il17A was correlated with poorer survival outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. Discussion These results suggest that aging induces a functional shift between MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, which may be influenced by transcriptional regulators like RORγt. The observed alterations in MAIT cell activity could potentially impact disease prognosis, particularly in colorectal cancer. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of MAIT cell responses at mucosal barriers, highlighting possible therapeutic targets for modulating MAIT cell functions in aging and disease.">

In this study, involving 394 individuals, we found direct linkage of branches spanning human biological functions often not studied in conjunction, using clinical data, gut microbial abundances, blood immune cell repertoires, blood transcriptomic and blood T cell receptor data. Contrary to current paradigms, we demonstrate that immunotypes and enterotypes are orthogonal, likely fulfilling distinct roles in maintaining homeostasis, only bridged via the blood transcriptome. We also identified two distinct inflammatory profiles: the first driven by interferon signalling and the other characterised by non-viral, NF-kB and IL-6 markers. Lastly, we present compelling data showing strong associations of the Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae bacteria with a healthy immunotype and transcriptomic pattern, highlighting their potential role in immune health.

        <tr id="Stroke is a severe neurological disease and a major worldwide issue, mostly manifesting as ischemic stroke (IS). In order to create effective treatments for IS, it is imperative to fully understand the underlying pathologies, as the existing therapeutic choices are inadequate. Recent investigations have shown the complex relationships between several programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, and their correlation with immune responses during IS. However, this relationship is still unclear. To address this gap, this review study explored the cellular interactions in the immune microenvironment of IS. Then, to validate prior findings and uncover biomarkers, the study investigated bioinformatics studies. Several pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK), were involved in PCD-immune interactions. The bioinformatics studies reported key biomarkers such as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), gasdermin D (GSDMD), and TLR4, which have important implications in ferroptosis, cuproptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis respectively. These biomarkers were associated with PCD mechanisms such as oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions. The immune infiltration analysis consistently revealed a significant correlation between PCD pathways and detrimental immune cells, such as neutrophils and γδ T cells. Conversely, M2 macrophages and T helper cells showed protective effects. In conclusion, considering the intricate network of interactions between immune responses and PCD pathways, this study emphasized the necessity of a paradigm shift in therapeutic approaches to address the injuries that are related to this complex network.">

        <tr id="Introduction Chronic immune activation is a hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that significantly impacts disease pathogenesis. However, in-depth studies characterizing the immunological landscape of the ectocervix during chronic HIV infection remain scarce despite the importance of this tissue site for HIV transmission. Methods Ectocervical tissue samples were obtained from antiretroviral-naïve HIV-seropositive and -seronegative Kenyan female sex workers. These samples were assessed by spatial transcriptomics and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. We further performed multi-epitope ligand cartography (MELC) using an in situ staining panel that included 17 markers of primarily T cell–mediated immune responses. Results Spatial transcriptomics revealed tissue-wide immune activation encompassing immune responses associated with chronic HIV infection. First, both the epithelial and submucosal compartments showed diverse but significant upregulation of humoral immune responses, as indicated by the expression of several antibody-related genes. Second, an antiviral state–associated cellular immunity was also observed in the HIV-seropositive group, characterized by upregulation of genes involved in interferon signaling across the mucosal tissue and a more spatially restricted mucosal expression of genes related to T cell activity and effector functions relative to the HIV-seronegative group. Additionally, HIV associated structural alterations were evident within both compartments. Downregulated genes across the epithelium were mainly linked to epithelial integrity, with the outer layer involved in terminal differentiation and the inner layer associated with epithelial structure. MELC analysis further revealed a significantly increased ectocervical leukocyte population in HIV-seropositive participants, primarily driven by an increase in CD8+ T cells while the CD4+ T cell population remained stable. Consistent with our spatial transcriptomics data, T cells from HIV-seropositive participants showed an increased effector phenotype, defined by elevated expression of various granzymes. Conclusion By combining spatial transcriptomics and MELC, we identified significant HIV-associated cervical immune activity driven by induction of both T and B cell activity, together with a general antiviral state characterized by sustained interferon induction. These findings underscore that chronic HIV infection is associated with an altered ectocervical mucosal immune landscape years after primary infection. This sheds light on HIV pathogenesis at distant local sites and complements current knowledge on HIV-associated systemic immune activation.">

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

This study provides novel insights into HA’s role in COVID-19 pathology and its potential utility as a biomarker for disease severity. However, much remains to be understood about the lung HA matrix in COVID-19 and how it compares to other lung conditions. In particular, the role of HA-binding proteins in organizing HA into a crosslinked network is yet to be fully determined at a molecular level. This knowledge is crucial in understanding the inter-relationships between the structure of the HA matrix and the regulation of the immune response, and thus our ability to target HA therapeutically for improved outcomes in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global pandemic affecting millions of people's lives, which has led to 'post-COVID-19 fatigue'. Alarmingly, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only infects the lungs but also influences the heart and brain. Endothelial cell dysfunction and hypercoagulation, which we know occur with this infection, lead to thrombo-inflammation that can manifest as many myriad cardio-cerebrovascular disorders, such as brain fog, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, etc. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with oxidative stress, protein aggregation, cytokine storm, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, the identification of molecular targets involved in these actions could provide strategies for preventing and treating this disease. In particular, the very common enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) has recently been identified as a candidate co-receptor for the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with its involvement in infection. In addition, DPPIV has been reported as a co-receptor for some viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It mediates immunologic reactions and diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension, which have been considered the prime risk factors for stroke among other types of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), DPPIV has been implicated in aggravating the course of infection due to its disruptive effect on inflammatory signaling networks and the neuro-glia-vascular unit. Regarding the neurological, physiological, and molecular grounds governing post-COVID-19 fatigue, this review focuses on DPPIV as one of such reasons that progressively establishes cerebrovascular grievances following SARS-CoV infection.">

        <tr id="Hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibit diverse immune responses during acute infection, which are associated with a wide range of clinical outcomes. However, understanding these immune heterogeneities and their links to various clinical complications, especially long COVID, remains a challenge. In this study, we performed unsupervised subtyping of longitudinal multi-omics immunophenotyping in over 1,000 hospitalized patients, identifying two critical subtypes linked to mortality or mechanical ventilation with prolonged hospital stay and three severe subtypes associated with timely acute recovery. We confirmed that unresolved systemic inflammation and T-cell dysfunctions were hallmarks of increased severity and further distinguished patients with similar acute respiratory severity by their distinct immune profiles, which correlated with differences in demographic and clinical complications. Notably, one critical subtype (SubF) was uniquely characterized by early excessive inflammation, insufficient anticoagulation, and fatty acid dysregulation, alongside higher incidences of hematologic, cardiac, and renal complications, and an elevated risk of long COVID. Among the severe subtypes, significant differences in viral clearance and early antiviral responses were observed, with one subtype (SubC) showing strong early T-cell cytotoxicity but a poor humoral response, slower viral clearance, and greater risks of chronic organ dysfunction and long COVID. These findings provide crucial insights into the complex and context-dependent nature of COVID-19 immune responses, highlighting the importance of personalized therapeutic strategies to improve both acute and long-term outcomes.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes play a major role in intestinal homeostasis, with a particular impact on the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In Crohn’s disease (CD) patients, the intestinal mucosa is inflamed, epithelium permeability is increased, and IECs present compositional and functional defects. The role of T lymphocytes interactions with IECs in the physiopathology of CD remains in question. Here, we use a three-dimensional human autologous coculture model between purified intestinal organoids derived from primary tissues of CD and non-inflammatory control patients, and mucosal T lymphocytes extracted from the same location. We show that while in homeostatic context T cells support the proliferation and differentiation balance of organoids, mucosal T lymphocytes from CD patients present a high cytotoxicity against IECs. Importantly, this cytotoxicity is a persistent defect overtime in culture. Organoids also show defective intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferation and morphological changes.

        <tr id="Parthanatos is distinct from caspase-dependent apoptosis in that it does not necessitate the activation of caspase cascades; Instead, it relies on the translocation of Apoptosis-inducing Factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the nucleus, resulting in nuclear DNA fragmentation. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is an oncolytic virus that selectively targets and kills tumor cells by inducing cell apoptosis. It has been reported that NDV triggers classic apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In this study, we observed that NDV infection induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), which caused a rapid release of endogenous calcium ions (Ca2+). This cascade of events resulted in mitochondrial depolarization, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and structural remodeling of the mitochondria. The overload of Ca2+ also initiated an increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability, facilitating the transfer of AIF to the nucleus to induce apoptosis. Damaged mitochondria produced excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further exacerbated mitochondrial damage and increased mitochondrial membrane permeability, thus promoting additional intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and ultimately triggering an ROS burst. Collectively, these findings indicate that NDV infection promotes excessive calcium accumulation and ROS generation, leading to mitochondrial damage that releases more calcium and ROS, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates AIF-dependent parthanatos. This study not only provides a novel perspective on the oncolytic mechanism of NDV but also highlights new targets for antiviral research.">

It limits the movement of molecules and immune cells, regulates the entry of nutrients, and removes waste products from the brain. The dysfunction of the BBB has been identified in Parkinson’s disease (PD) but the role of the BBB and endothelial cells (ECs) has not been well studied. LRRK2 G2019S mutation is the most common PD causing mutation with similar pathophysiology than in sporadic cases. How the mutation affects EC function has not been investigated previously in patient cells. In the study, we used iPSC-derived ECs from PD patients with the LRRK2 mutation as well as cells from healthy individuals. We report that PD patients’ ECs have higher levels of α-synuclein and an decreased maximal and ATP-linked respiration and altered response to inflammatory exposure, especially to TNFα. In addition, transcriptomic analysis showed upregulation of fatty-acid-synthesis-related pathways in PD patients’ ECs and the downregulation of lncRNA MEG3, both of which have been associated with PD. Altogether, PD patients’ ECs manifest some of the PD-related hallmarks and are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex biological process related to a variety of pathologies, often requiring better understanding in order to develop new, targeted therapeutic interventions. Within this context, multimodal Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) has been used to characterise molecular changes in neuroinflammation for biomarker discovery not possible to other techniques. In this study, molecules including bioactive lipids were detected across inflamed regions of the brain in rats treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The detected lipids may be acting as inflammatory mediators of the immune response. We identified that N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) species accumulated in the inflamed area. The presence of these lipids could be related to the endocannabinoid (eCB) signalling system, mediating an anti-inflammatory response from microglial cells at the site of injury to balance pro-inflammation and support neuronal protection. In addition, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically n-3 and n-6 species, were observed to accumulate in the area where LPS was injected. PUFAs are directly linked to anti-inflammatory mediators resolving inflammation. Finally, acylcarnitine species accumulated around the inflammation region. Accumulation of these molecules could be due to a deficient β-oxidation cycle.">

        <tr id="Elimination of latent HIV-1 is a major goal of AIDS research but the host factors determining the size of these reservoirs are poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether differences in host gene expression modulate the size of the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive ART. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from fourteen individuals initiating ART during acute infection who demonstrated effective viral suppression but varying magnitude of total HIV-1 DNA were characterized by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways demonstrated increased monocyte activity in participants with undetectable HIV-1 reservoirs. IL1B expression in CD14+ monocytes showed the greatest fold difference. The inverse association of IL1B with reservoir size was validated in an independent cohort comprised of 38 participants with different genetic backgrounds and HIV-1 subtype infections, and further confirmed with intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA®) measurements of intact HIV-1 proviruses in a subset of the samples. Modeling interactions with cell population frequencies showed that monocyte IL1B expression associated inversely with reservoir size in the context of higher frequencies of central memory CD4+ T cells, implicating an indirect effect of IL1B via the cell type well established to be a reservoir for persistent HIV-1. Signatures consisting of co-expressed genes including IL1B were highly enriched in the “TNFα signaling via NF-κB” geneset. Functional analyses in cell culture revealed that IL1B activates NF-κB, thereby promoting productive HIV-1 infection while simultaneously suppressing viral spread, suggesting a natural latency reversing activity to deplete the reservoir in ART treated individuals. Altogether, unbiased high throughput scRNA-seq analyses revealed that monocyte IL1B variation could decrease HIV-1 proviral reservoirs in individuals initiating ART during acute infection.">

        <tr id="Background In recent years, COVID-19 and tuberculosis have emerged as major infectious diseases, significantly contributing to global mortality as respiratory illnesses. There is increasing evidence of a reciprocal influence between these diseases, exacerbating their incidence, severity, and mortality rates. Methods This study involved retrieving COVID-19 and tuberculosis data from the GEO database and identifying common differentially expressed genes. Machine learning techniques, specifically random forest analysis, were applied to pinpoint key genes for diagnosing COVID-19. The Cibersort algorithm was employed to estimate immune cell infiltration in individuals with COVID-19. Additionally, single-cell sequencing was used to study the distribution of VNN1 within immune cells, and molecular docking provided insights into potential drugs targeting these critical prognosis genes. Results GMNN, SCD, and FUT7 were identified as robust diagnostic markers for COVID-19 across training and validation datasets. Importantly, VNN1 was associated with the progression of severe COVID-19, showing a strong correlation with clinical indicators and immune cell infiltration. Single-cell sequencing demonstrated a predominant distribution of VNN1 in neutrophils, and molecular docking highlighted potential pharmacological targets for VNN1. Conclusions This study enhances our understanding of the shared pathogenic mechanisms underlying tuberculosis and COVID-19, providing essential insights that could improve the diagnosis and treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="Context Fever is an evolutionarily conserved and adaptive response during infections. However, prolonged fever has numerous systemic metabolic and functional side effects. In the heart, prolonged fever associated with infection is linked to fatal adverse effects, particularly involving impaired coronary circulation. Yet, the direct relationship between elevated temperature and coronary microcirculation dysfunction, remains to be fully demonstrated. In this study, we aimed to explore the specific responses of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) to fever-range hyperthermia. Method HCAECs were cultured at either 37°C or 40°C for up to 24 hours. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiles were obtained through microarray and mass spectrometry after 6, 12, and 24 hours of exposure. Key signaling pathways, upstream regulators, and candidate mechanisms were identified and validated at the mRNA and protein levels using mechanistic approaches. Results Prolonged hyperthermia compromised HCAEC function, evidenced by cell detachment, loss of junctions, and increased permeability. HCAECs rapidly activated the unfolded protein response (UPR), including IRE1α activation and XBP1 splicing. Additionally, autophagic flux was significantly elevated, participating in the degradation of junction proteins. Pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α reduced the autophagic burden, protected against cell detachment, and preserved junction integrity over time. Conclusion Our findings reveal that in response to fever-range hyperthermia, the IRE1α-autophagy axis regulates the survival and function of coronary endothelial cells. This mechanism could play a key role in modulating endothelial responses during infection and contribute to the pathological outcomes of fever. Furthermore, it may be relevant in local inflammatory conditions with elevated temperatures.">

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and fatal disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition within the lung. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have identified unique populations of epithelial cells lacking KRT5 while expressing KRT17; fibroblasts characterized by high collagen production, and the expression of CTHRC1; as well as a distinct subset of SPP1 positive macrophages. However, the precise interactions among these and potentially other cells that lead to the formation of fibrotic niche remain unclear. Methods Using spatial transcriptomics and Hyperion imaging mass cytometry we compared the cellular populations in formalin fixed paraffin embedded fibrotic lesions (n=9 patients) with control lung (n=9), and using CellChat we investigated the cellular interactions. Results Spatial transcriptomic analysis identified 180,067 cells which demonstrated three unique fibrotic niches enriched for KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells, SPP1+ macrophages and collagen producing fibroblasts as well as a unique DCN+ expressing plasma B cell. Ligand receptor analysis inferred that most fibrotic cells interacted with ATII cells, with the exception of KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells which interacted primarily with macrophages. Hyperion Mass Cytometry identified 55,979 cells, which identified similar cell populations clustered into two unique fibrotic niches: a stromal fibrotic niche characterized by CTHRC1+ fibroblasts interacting with fibrotic associated plasma cells, and a second niche containing KRT5-/KRT17+ cells and SPP1+ macrophages. This latter niche appeared likely to originate from the control bronchial niche with progressive loss of KRT5. Conclusion These findings describe the characteristics of the fibrotic niche, support the hypothesis that basal cells can also contribute to the origin of the fibrotic epithelium and describe a novel fibrotic plasma cell population, shedding light on the complex cellular dynamics within fibrotic human lung tissues.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction This review delves into the intricate relationship between NLR inflammasomes, particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the immune‐mediated neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). While the precise etiology of MS remains elusive, compelling research underscores the pivotal role of the immune response in disease progression. Notably, recent investigations highlight the significant involvement of NLRP3 inflammasomes in various autoimmune diseases, prompting an in‐depth exploration of their impact on MS. Method The review focuses on elucidating the activation mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasomes within microglia/macrophages (MG/MФ), examining how this activation promotes an inflammatory response that exacerbates neuronal damage in MS. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature and research findings forms the basis for understanding the intricate interplay between NLRP3 inflammasomes and MS pathogenesis. Results Synthesizing current research, the review provides insight into the pivotal role played by NLR inflammasomes, specifically NLRP3, in MS. Emphasis is placed on the inflammatory response orchestrated by activated MG/MФ, elucidating the cascade that perpetuates neuronal damage in the disease. Conclusions This review concludes by consolidating key findings and offering a nuanced perspective on the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in MS pathogenesis. The detailed exploration of the activation process within MG/MФ provides a foundation for understanding the disease's underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the review sets the stage for potential therapeutic strategies targeting NLRP3 inflammasomes in the pursuit of MS treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chlamydia genital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease worldwide. A mouse model has been developed in our laboratory to better understand the effect of cold-induced stress on chlamydia genital infection and immune response. However, the stress mechanism affecting the host response to Chlamydia muridarum genital infection remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a role for the beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), which binds noradrenaline and modulates the immune response against chlamydia genital infection in a mouse model. A successful β2-AR homozygous knockout (KO) mouse model was used to study the infection and analyze the immune response. Our data show that stressed mice lacking the β2-AR are less susceptible to C. muridarum genital infection than controls. A correlation was obtained between lower organ load and higher interferon-gamma production by CD4+ and CD8+ cells of the KO mice. Furthermore, exposure of CD4+ T cells to noradrenaline alters the production of cytokines in mice during C. muridarum genital infection. This study suggests that the blockade of β2-AR signaling could be used to increase resistance to chlamydia genital infection. We value the β2-AR KO as a viable model that can provide reproducible results in investigating medical research, including chlamydia genital infection.">

        <tr id="Viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in children worldwide. Despite this, no studies have employed proteomics to characterize host immune responses to severe pediatric vLRTI in both the lower airway and systemic circulation. To address this gap, gain insights into vLRTI pathophysiology, and test a novel diagnostic approach, we assayed 1,305 proteins in tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma from 62 critically ill children using SomaScan. We performed differential expression (DE) and pathway analyses comparing vLRTI (n = 40) to controls with non-infectious acute respiratory failure (n = 22), developed a diagnostic classifier using LASSO regression, and analyzed matched TA and plasma samples. We further investigated the impact of viral load and bacterial coinfection on the proteome. The TA signature of vLRTI was characterized by 200 DE proteins (Padj <0.05) with upregulation of interferons and T cell responses and downregulation of inflammation-modulating proteins including FABP and MIP-5. A nine-protein TA classifier achieved an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90-1.00) for identifying vLRTI. In plasma, the host response to vLRTI was more muted with 56 DE proteins. Correlation between TA and plasma was limited, although ISG15 was elevated in both compartments. In bacterial coinfection, we observed increases in the TNF-stimulated protein TSG-6, as well as CRP, and interferon-related proteins. Viral load correlated positively with interferon signaling and negatively with neutrophil-activation pathways. Taken together, our study provides fresh insights into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI and identifies novel protein biomarkers with diagnostic potential.IMPORTANCEWe describe the first proteomic profiling of the lower airway and blood in critically ill children with severe viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI). From tracheal aspirate (TA), we defined a proteomic signature of vLRTI characterized by increased expression of interferon signaling proteins and decreased expression of proteins involved in immune modulation including FABP and MIP-5. Using machine learning, we developed a parsimonious diagnostic classifier that distinguished vLRTI from non-infectious respiratory failure with high accuracy. Comparative analysis of paired TA and plasma specimens demonstrated limited concordance, although the interferon-stimulated protein ISG15 was significantly upregulated with vLRTI in both compartments. We further identified TSG-6 and CRP as airway biomarkers of bacterial-viral coinfection, and viral load analyses demonstrated a positive correlation with interferon-related protein expression and a negative correlation with the expression of neutrophil activation proteins. Taken together, our study provides new insights into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI.">

        <tr id="Immunogenic cell death (ICD) spatiotemporally regulates damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) derived from dying cancer cells to signal the immune response. Intriguingly, these DAMPs and cytokines also induce cellular responses in non-immune cells, particularly cancer cells. Several ICD-modulating natural products and miRNAs have been reported to regulate the DAMP, cytokine, and cell death responses, but they lack systemic organization and connection. This review summarizes the impacts of natural products and miRNAs on the DAMP and cytokine responses and cancer cell death responses (apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis). We establish the rationale that ICD inducers of natural products have modulating effects on miRNAs, targeting DAMPs and cytokines for immune and cancer cell death responses. In conclusion, DAMP, cytokine, and cell death responses are intricately linked in cancer cells, and they are influenced by ICD-modulating natural products and miRNAs.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients.We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex.Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection.These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The intricate interplay between circulating metabolites and immune responses, though crucial to disease pathophysiology, remains poorly understood and underexplored in systematic research. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the immune response and circulating metabolome in two Western European cohorts (534 and 324 healthy individuals) and one from sub-Saharan Africa (323 healthy donors). At metabolic level, our analysis uncovered sex differences in the correlation between phosphatidylcholine and cytokine responses upon ex-vivo stimulations. Notably, sphingomyelin showed a significant negative correlation with the monocyte-derived cytokine production in response to Staphylococcus aureus stimulation, a finding validated through functional experiments. Subsequently, employing Mendelian randomization analysis, we established a link between sphingomyelin and COVID-19 severity, providing compelling evidence for a modulatory effect of sphingomyelin on immune responses during human infection. Collectively, our results represent a unique resource (https://lab-li.ciim-hannover.de/apps/imetabomap/) for exploring metabolic signatures associated with immune function in different populations, highlighting sphingomyelin metabolism as a potential target in treating inflammatory and infectious diseases.">

 SARS-CoV-2, which mostly affects the respiratory system, is the agent that causes COVID-19. The virus enters human cells through the ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on the surface of many different types of cells in the body. Once inside the cell, the virus begins to replicate and spread throughout the body. Interferon Lambda-1, also known as IFN-λ1, is a type of cytokine that is secreted by the immune system of the body in response to viral infections.
 Objective to evaluate if serum levels of Interferon Lambda-1 are associated with how severe the COVID-19 infection is, so as to determine if this cytokine may be considered as a disease marker.
 This study was undertaken as a case control, using a study population of one hundred and twenty COVID-19 patients (79 males, 41 females). The COVID-19 patients were divided into three groups based on the severity of the illness: critical disease (n=30), severe disease (n=30), and mild/moderate disease (n=60), with (n=60) healthy volunteers as the control group (35 males, 25 females). Between January 2022 and May 2022, the patients were collected from Al-Amal hospitals and the AL-Shefaa center in AL- Najaf City, Iraq. Basic patient clinical and demographic data was obtained, along with blood samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent tests (ELISA) were used to measure the blood’s concentration of interferon lambda-1. Total cholesterol, triglycerides and high density lipoprotein content were measured by colorimetric methods. Ichroma was tested for serum ferritin and D-dimer, while CBC was obtained via Swelab to ascertain if interferon Lambda-1 levels are related to the severity of the disease.
 Interferon Lambda-1 levels in the patient group were determined to be higher, particularly in cases with mild to moderate (64.19±18.77) pg/mL (P=0.0001), severe (236.51±63.65) pg/mL (P=0.0001), and critical (465.61±62.16) pg/mL (P=0.0001) cases, as compared to healthy controls (41.72±12.92) pg/mL groups, respectively. Our results showed a significant negative correlation between SPO2%, Lymphocyte, HDL, TC and Hb (p.value=0.001) levels in the group of COVID-19 patients. TG, VLDL-C, neutrophils, WBCs, platelets, the N/L ratio, D-dimer, CRP and ferritin all have a significant positive correlation (p.value=0.001) with Interferon Lambda-1 in the COVID-19 patients group. A cutoff value of 50.50 (ng/mL) with a sensitivity of 82.5% and a specificity of 80.9% (AUC: 0.910, 95% CI 0.870-0.950; p<0.0001) for Interferon Lambda-1 predicted severe COVID-19.
 In comparison to the mild/moderate patient group and healthy controls, we found that severe and critical COVID-19 patients had considerably greater serum Interferon Lambda-1 concentrations. This could be a useful sign of the disease’s severity. In order to prevent the onset of pulmonary inflammation, high blood Interferon Lambda-1 concentrations in the early stages of COVID-19 should be continuously monitored. Our work also revealed that Interferon Lambda-1 was highly associated with COVID-19 severity. We believe that Interferon Lambda-1 may be a valuable biomarker in determining the severity of the disease in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Background Cytokines and chemokines as crucial participants in innate immune response play significant roles during SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet excessive immune response exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Purpose This study aims to investigate the involvement of which cytokines/chemokines in the cytokine storm of COVID-19, as well as the changes in cytokine/chemokine levels during the course of COVID-19, simultaneously exploring the diagnostic and prognostic value of the relevant cytokines/chemokines for COVID-19. Methods Flow cytometry was employed to detect the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the serum of 50 COVID-19 patients. Results Compared with severe COVID-19 patients, the levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, sCD25, and chemokines IP-10 and MIG in the peripheral blood of non-severe patients were significantly reduced, while only IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10 levels were significantly decreased compared to non-survivors of COVID-19. Meanwhile, serum concentrations of IP-10, MCP-1, sTREM-1, IL-10, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood could distinguish between COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors and were significantly associated with mortality. Among them, the concentration of IP-10 was shown to be the most powerful indicator for predicting adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (AUC: 0.715); however, its combined detection with the conventional inflammatory marker NLR did not improve the predictive value for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, serum IP-10 levels were negatively correlated with peripheral blood NK cell count and total lymphocyte count, while sTREM-1 levels were positively correlated with peripheral blood CD4+ T cell count and CD3+ T cell count. Meanwhile, IL-8 levels were positively correlated with total lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. Finally, the serum levels of cytokines/chemokines in non-survivors of COVID-19 increased significantly before death, while in survivors, they returned to normal levels before discharge. Conclusions Severely ill and non-surviving COVID-19 patients exhibit compromised immune function, with significantly higher levels of inflammation, cytokine/chemokine storms, and immune dysregulation compared to non-severe patients. Serum concentrations of IP-10, MCP-1, sTREM-1, and IL-10 levels can serve as biomarkers to predict adverse outcomes in COVID-19.">

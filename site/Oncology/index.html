        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Memory T cells play an important role in mediating long-lasting adaptive immune responses to viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2. In the context of the latter, much of our current knowledge stems from studies in vaccinated individuals or repeatedly infected individuals. However, limited knowledge is available on these responses in fully naive individuals in German communities. We performed immunophenotyping of a previously naive SARS-CoV-2 cohort in convalescent individuals after asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19. The samples were collected median 250 days post infection during the first wave of the COVID pandemic in Germany (March – May 2020). In this cohort of 174 individuals, we phenotyped different leukocyte cell populations in peripheral blood (B, T and Natural Killer cells). We then assessed the serostatus against the SARS-CoV-2 antigens Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike subunit (S1) with its receptor binding domain (RBD), as these are important correlates of protection, by testing for presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We also measured IgG antibody responses against the N antigen of the common cold coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, to determine possible cross-reactivity. In a subset of the cohort (n = 76), we performed intracellular staining assays (ICS) after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens. Key findings are significant differences in frequency of CD4+ memory T cell populations, notably CD4+ TEM and CD4+ TEMRA cells, between the group of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and the control group. These differences correlated with cytokine production (TNFα, IFNγ) after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides, indicating a specific T cell immune response. In conclusion, a clear memory T cell and humoral response can be detected up to 250 days post mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Our results underline findings reported by others indicating a lasting cellular immune response even in a population which previously had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune‐stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA‐seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell–cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage–endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage‐derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage‐driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

        <tr id="Frequent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in vulnerable populations has raised concerns that this may contribute to T cell exhaustion, which could negatively affect the quality of immune protection. Herein, we examined the impact of repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on T cell phenotypic and functional exhaustion in frail older adults in long-term care (n = 23), individuals on immunosuppressive drugs (n = 10), and healthy adults (n = 43), in Canada. Spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels did not decline in any cohort following repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, nor did the expression of exhaustion markers on spike-specific or total T cells increase. T cell production of multiple cytokines (i.e. polyfunctionality) in response to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 did not decline in any cohort following repeated vaccination. None of the cohorts displayed elevated levels of terminally differentiated T cells following multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Thus, repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was not associated with increased T cell exhaustion in older frail adults, immunosuppressed individuals, or healthy adults.">

        <tr id="Viral infection triggers both cellular and systemic responses in vivo. These are sometimes difficult to study since the immune system is subject to constant challenge from multiple pathogens. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a unique opportunity arose to measure the body’s immune response during lockdown, when exposure to pathogens from the environment was substantially lower. This allowed measurement of COVID-naïve patients, as well as those who had recovered from COVID-19. The effects of subsequent vaccination and boosters could also be assessed. This offers two advantages; an insight into the humoral response to novel pathogens, and the opportunity to measure the ability of the body to respond to challenge from both new pathogens and those to which exposure had already occurred. In this paper, we used dielectrophoresis (DEP) to analyze the electrophysiological fingerprint of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors who had never had COVID-19, those who had recovered from COVID-19, and those who received first, second, or third vaccine doses. This was performed before and after incubation with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to determine whether differential changes in the electrical properties of PBMCs could be detected and evaluated. Clear trends in response over time were observed, suggesting that DEP could pave the way towards a new correlate of protection (CoP) to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, since the test measures immune response to challenge, it may be widely applicable to other diseases.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a heterogeneous infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The distinctive features of COVID-19 infection encompass a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe illness involving diverse underlying pathophysiological processes such as hyperinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic microangiopathies, and multiple organ failure. However, the host responses to COVID-19, including systemic inflammation and immunity against SARS-CoV-2, remain largely undefined across different disease states. Here, we performed global transcriptome profiling of 228 peripheral blood samples of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations and subsequent clustering using an unsupervised algorithm. We identified various transcriptomic clusters and globally dysregulated immune-related pathways, leading to distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles in severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This underscores the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release. Additionally, our results reveal variances in circulating cell populations and the activation of apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients with diverse clinical presentations offers valuable insights into molecular mechanisms and may inform clinical decisions on anti-inflammatory therapies.

        <tr id="Long‐term consequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are unknown since recovered individuals can experience symptoms and latent viral reactivation for months. Indeed, acute post‐infection sequelae have also been observed in other respiratory viral infections, including influenza. To characterize post‐COVID‐19 and post‐influenza induced alterations to the cellular immunome, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients 3 months after recovery from COVID‐19 (n = 93) or influenza (n = 25), and from pre‐pandemic healthy controls (n = 25). PBMCs were characterized using a 40‐plex mass cytometry panel. Principal component analysis (PCA), classification models, and K‐means clustering were subsequently applied. PCA identified distinct immune profiles between cohorts, with both post‐COVID and post‐flu patients displaying an altered chemokine receptor expression compared to pre‐pandemic healthy controls. These alterations were more prominent in post‐COVID patients since they exhibited highly increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6 by various lymphoid populations, while post‐influenza patients mainly showed a decrease in CCR4 expression by naïve T cells, monocytes, and conventional dendritic cells. Classification models using immunophenotyping data confirm the three groups, while K‐means clustering revealed two subgroups among post‐COVID patients, with younger patients showing more pronounced immune alterations in the chemokine receptor profile, independently of long COVID symptoms. In conclusion, post‐COVID and post‐influenza patients exhibit distinct and unique persistent immune alterations. Understanding these altered immune profiles can guide targeted therapies for post‐COVID syndrome and highlight differences in immune recovery from various respiratory infections.">

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) is a severe condition that may follow sepsis and is characterized by ongoing inflammation and immune suppression, diminishing quality of life and potentially causing death. The role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in PICS, despite their association with thrombopoiesis, is not well understood. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile MKs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from 11 patients, including six with PICS, five with sepsis, and five healthy controls, to determine the diversity and molecular signatures of the MKs. Five subgroups of MKs are identified (MK1-MK5), and their proportions vary across the groups. MK1 and MK2 are predominant in PICS. Gene Ontology analysis shows that genes related to antigen processing and presentation and IL-17 signaling are enriched in MK1, whereas genes associated with platelet degranulation and neutrophil activation are enriched in MK2. Moreover, the expression level of CCL5 is markedly increased in MKs. Ligand-receptor analysis reveals dynamic interactions among MKs and T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages, suggesting a broad role of MKs in immune homeostasis. In PICS model mice, MKs regulate systemic inflammation by reducing the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A and promoting lung tissue repair. Our findings establish MKs as essential components of the immune system in PICS and provide new insights into their potential as therapeutic targets for post-sepsis immune dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections involve prolonged viral replication and immune system interactions, potentially driving viral evolution and immune escape. This study examines viral characteristics and host gene expression changes in persistent infections. The nasopharyngeal samples from four patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections at Tottori University Hospital, Japan, were analyzed. Viral isolates were cultured, and infectivity was assessed using TCID50 assays. To investigate host responses, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis mapped affected biological pathways. Viral genome sequencing detected mutations associated with prolonged infection. The results showed significant infectivity differences between early- and late-phase infection. Gene expression analysis revealed a strong early phase of pro-inflammatory response (IL6, TNF, IL1B, CXCL10) followed by immune suppression. GO enrichment analysis highlighted inflammation and cytokine-mediated immune pathways. Genomic sequencing identified mutations in ORF1ab and the spike (S) protein, potentially aiding immune escape. The findings underscore that SARS-CoV-2 adapts during persistent infections, altering infectivity and immune responses. These highlight the need for continued monitoring of prolonged infections to mitigate immune escape and viral evolution.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is characterized by CNS infiltration of autoreactive immune cells that drive both acute inflammatory demyelination and chronic progressive axonal and neuronal injury. Expanding evidence implicates CD8+ antineural T cells in the neurodegeneration that underlies irreversible clinical progression in multiple sclerosis, yet therapies specifically targeting this cell population are limited. CD8+ T cells from patients with MS exhibit increased engagement of the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway reduced glycolysis, glucose uptake, NADPH production, ATP production, proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in CD8+ T cells activated by ligation of CD3 and CD28. Pentose phosphate pathway inhibition also prevented CD8+ T cell–mediated antigen-specific neuronal injury in vitro and in both an adoptive transfer–based cuprizone model of demyelination and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Notably, transcriptional profiling of CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients with MS indicated increased pentose phosphate pathway engagement, suggesting that this pathway is involved in CD8+ T cell–mediated injury of axons and neurons in the demyelinated CNS. Inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway disrupts CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming and effector functions, suggesting that such inhibition may serve as a therapeutic strategy to prevent neurodegeneration in patients with progressive MS.">

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed using a Chromium Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead Chip and Library Kit from 10x Genomics (Drop-seq method). Furthermore, we estimated the cytotoxic functions of natural killer (NK) cells by flow cytometry using surface and intracellular staining.Using two independent geographical cohorts, we identified that NK cells had a sustained reduction during active infection and after recovery. Further, scRNA-seq data revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 rewired the gene expression profile of NK, monocytes, CD4+, CD8+ effector T cells and antibody producing B cells in convalescent pregnant women. Several gene pathways associated with cytotoxic function, interferon signalling type I & II, and pro- and anti-inflammatory functions in NK and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were attenuated in recovered pregnant patients compared with healthy pregnancies. We validated our scRNA-seq of NK cells from convalescent pregnant women and confirmed that NK cells had diminished levels of cytotoxic proteins; perforin, CD122 and granzyme B.Overall, our study uncovers that SARS-CoV-2 infection deranges the adaptive immune response in pregnant women even after recovery and may contribute to post-COVID19 sequalae of symptoms.">

        <tr id="T cell responses are vital for controlling viral infection in the central nervous system (CNS), but must be tightly regulated to limit tissue-damaging inflammation. Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) CNS infection, an in vivo model for JCPyV-induced Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), we investigated sites of early infection, immune responses, and recruitment of T cells to the brain. Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) single-cell spatial transcriptomics was applied to assess the regionality of virus infection and brain-resident cell and infiltrating leukocyte responses. MERFISH, immunofluorescence microscopy, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry demonstrate that the ependyma is the predominant region of MuPyV CNS infection and localization of T cells, and implicated CXCR4 and CXCR6 in T cell migration to the ependyma and subventricular zone. Using CXCR6 knockout mice and a specific CXCR4 small molecule antagonist, we found that the combined impairment of CXCR6 and CXCR4 signaling resulted in elevated infiltration of T cells in the MuPyV-infected brain. This work demonstrates that CXCR4 and CXCR6 act in a nonredundant fashion to restrict T cell accumulation to the polyomavirus-infected ependyma, with important implications for ongoing efforts to use JCPyV-specific T cell adoptive immunotherapy for PML.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), continues to circulate globally despite the widespread vaccination and therapeutics like Paxlovid, remdesivir, and molnupiravir. COVID-19 is associated with both respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations, with persistent intestinal pathology contributing to the post-COVID-19 condition. We have previously demonstrated the antiviral activity of autophagy-blocking drugs, such as Berbamine dihydrochloride, against intestinal SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. In addition, the autophagy blockers restored the barrier function of infected intestinal epithelium. In this addendum, using human intestinal organoids, we present evidence for a protective role of intrinsic higher levels of autophagy flux in limiting intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological treatment with Akt inhibitor MK-2206 hydrochloride suppressed viral entry into the intestinal epithelium. This antiviral effect of MK-2206 was shown to be dependent on Synaptosomal-associated protein 29-dependent (SNAP-29)-mediated autophagy flux. Furthermore, extrinsically enhanced autophagy with MK-2206 also prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced intestinal barrier damage. Our findings thus underscore the intricate role of autophagy pathways in the dissemination and pathogenesis of intestinal SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the therapeutic potential of host-directed therapies targeting autophagy to intervene in COVID-19-associated sequelae and improve intestinal health.">

        <tr id="Multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) exposures either due to infection or vaccination result in differential immune responses. Limited data exist on community-level SARS-CoV-2 variant exposures in India. We assessed antibody levels in 211 unvaccinated and 349 vaccinated individuals with and without prior exposure, followed for ~ 2 years (May 2021–October 2023) with baseline blood, weekly saliva for RT-PCR, and blood draws at ~ 6, 12, and 24 months. Humoral and cellular immune responses following primary (N = 8) and secondary (N = 11) Omicron infections in unvaccinated, previously exposed (N = 25), and unexposed vaccinated (N = 14) individuals were evaluated using Meso Scale Discovery and flow cytometry assays at Day 0, 30, and 90. Previously exposed individuals had higher anti-spike IgG levels at baseline (median 57,732 vs. 11,359, p < 0.001 in unvaccinated; 93,827 vs. 26,883, p < 0.001 in vaccinated) and 99% seropositivity at 2 years. Secondary Omicron infection elicited higher anti-spike IgG levels (17,320 vs. 3,930, p < 0.01) and stronger CD8 T cell responses (median CD8 AIM 0.026 vs. 0.001, p = 0.01 at Day90) than primary Omicron infection. Vaccinated individuals showed comparable CD4 and CD8 T cell responses irrespective of prior exposure, but previously exposed individuals had more durable antibodies at Day90 (p < 0.05 in previously exposed). Anti-spike IgG levels and %ACE-2 inhibition to Omicron were lower in both groups compared to other variants. High seropositivity was observed in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals after multiple exposures, though antibody levels were higher in individuals with prior exposure. These findings underscore preserved T cell responses to Omicron, although with lesser magnitude among unvaccinated.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a major health emergency since its emergence in late 2019. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of COVID-19, leading to severe illness, i.e. coagulopathy, multi-organ failure. FX06, a fibrin-derived peptide naturally occurring in the human body, formerly known as Bβ15-42, is a promising therapeutic candidate for endothelial complications like capillary leakage in COVID-19 and other forms of acute respiratory disorders. The aim of this project is to investigate whether FX06 can attenuate COVID-19 cytokine-triggered inflammatory processes in vitro. Methods To mimic the inflammatory status of COVID-19, a human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell line (ECs) – HULEC-5a, was treated with a cytokine cocktail comprised of ten different cytokines or chemokines at concentrations found in serum profiles of COVID-19 patients with severe illness, further referred to as the severe cytokine cocktail. ECs were treated with the severe cytokine cocktail for 24 h, in the absence or presence of FX06 for 2 h. Results The severe cytokine cocktail enhanced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-endothelial adhesion and monolayer transmigration. This deleterious effect was significantly reduced by FX06. FX06 was also shown to mitigate the cytotoxic activity of allogeneic CD8+ T cells, which increased upon cytokine treatment. FX06 restored continuous vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin/CD144 distribution on the EC surface and reversed morphological changes mediated by the severe cytokine cocktail, such as the elongation of F-actin stress fibers. FX06 reduced capillary-like structure formation of the severe cytokine cocktail treated-ECs, indicating FX06 down-regulated the pro-inflammatory angiogenic activity caused by the severe cytokine cocktail. Additionally, FX06 might assist in maintaining the normal barrier function of ECs by altering the surface expression of Syndecan-1 (SDC1/CD138). Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses demonstrated that FX06 in the presence of the severe cytokine cocktail inactivated RhoGTPase, which was confirmed by western blotting that FX06 attenuated RhoA, a member of RhoGTPase, enhanced by the severe cytokine cocktail and down-regulated the expression of the phosphorylated downstream protein, ROCK1. Conclusion Overall, FX06 shows promising potential in normalizing ECs and reducing vascular leakage to protect the endothelium against the proinflammatory effect of COVID-19-triggered cytokines.">

        <tr id="Innate immune cells appear to have an important implication in the resolution and/or the aggravation of the COVID-19 pathogenesis after infection with SARS-CoV-2. To better appreciate the role of these cells during COVID-19, changes in blood eosinophil, the neutrophil and monocyte count, and levels of surface protein markers have been reported. However, analyses at several timepoints of multiple surface markers on granulocytes and monocytes over a period of one month after a SARS-CoV-2 infection are missing. Therefore, in this study, we performed blood eosinophil, neutrophil, and monocyte phenotyping using a list of surface proteins and flow cytometry during a period of 30 days after the hospitalization of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Blood cell counts were reported at seven different timepoints over the 30-day period as well as measures of multiple mediators in serum using a targeted multiplex assay approach. Our results indicate a 95% drop in the blood eosinophil count by D1, with eosinophils displaying a phenotype defined as CD69/CD63/CD125high and CCR3/CD44low during the early phases of hospitalization. Conversely, by D7 the neutrophil count increased significantly and displayed an immature, activated, and immunosuppressive phenotype (i.e., 3% of CD10/CD16low and CD10lowCD177high, 6.7% of CD11bhighCD62Llow, and 1.6% of CD16highCD62Llow), corroborated by enhanced serum proteins that are markers of neutrophil activation. Finally, our results suggest a rapid recruitment of non-classical monocytes leaving CD163/CD64high and CD32low monocytes in circulation during the very early phase. In conclusion, our study reveals potential very early roles for eosinophils and monocytes in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 with a likely reprogramming of eosinophils in the bone marrow. The exact roles of the pro-inflammatory neutrophils and the functions of the eosinophils and the monocytes, as well as these innate immune cell types, interplays need to be further investigated.">

        <tr id="Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may present with a wide clinical spectrum, including extrapulmonary involvement, such as neurological damage. Although the pathogenesis of neurological COVID-19 still remains unclear, some studies have discussed the potential association between tissue injury and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and/or immune imbalance. These two mechanisms are non-mutually exclusive; however, exacerbated inflammatory-response-induced neurological damage appears to be more aligned with COVID-19 pathogenesis, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication in the CNS remains widely discussed. Herein, we dissect this last issue, highlighting some evidence on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, as well as discussing gaps that should be addressed for a better understanding of its potential neurotropism, specifically in the CNS. Finally, we propose some deeper reflections on the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic potential.">

        <tr id="Background Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a significant threat to human health. The virus causes potentially fatal disease of the central nervous system (CNS), for which no treatments are available. TBEV infected individuals display a wide spectrum of neuronal disease, the determinants of which are undefined. Changes to host metabolism and virus-induced immunity have been postulated to contribute to the neuronal damage observed in infected individuals. In this study, we evaluated the cytokine, chemokine, and metabolic alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of symptomatic patients infected with TBEV presenting with meningitis or encephalitis. Our aim was to investigate the host immune and metabolic responses associated with specific TBEV infectious outcomes. Methods CSF samples of patients with meningitis (n = 27) or encephalitis (n = 25) were obtained upon consent from individuals hospitalised with confirmed TBEV infection in Brno. CSF from uninfected control patients was also collected for comparison (n = 12). A multiplex bead-based system was used to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Untargeted metabolomics followed by bioinformatics and integrative omics were used to profile the levels of metabolites in the CSF. Human motor neurons (hMNs) were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and infected with the highly pathogenic TBEV-Hypr strain to profile the role(s) of identified metabolites during the virus lifecycle. Virus infection was quantified via plaque assay. Results Significant differences in proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-α2, TSLP, IL-1α, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-12p40, IL-15, and IL-18) and chemokines (IL-8, CCL20, and CXCL11) were detected between neurological-TBEV and control patients. A total of 32 CSF metabolites differed in TBE patients with meningitis and encephalitis. CSF S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP1) and Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) levels were 2.4-fold (range ≥ 2.3-≥3.2) higher in encephalitis patients compared to the meningitis group. CSF urocanic acid levels were significantly lower in patients with encephalitis compared to those with meningitis (p = 0.012209). Follow-up analyses showed fluctuations in the levels of O-phosphoethanolamine, succinic acid, and L-proline in the encephalitis group, and pyruvic acid in the meningitis group. TBEV-infection of hMNs increased the production of SAM, FBP1 and PEP in a time-dependent manner. Depletion of the metabolites with characterised pharmacological inhibitors led to a concentration-dependent attenuation of virus growth, validating the identified changes as key mediators of TBEV infection. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the neurological disease outcome of TBEV infection is associated with specific and dynamic metabolic signatures in the cerebrospinal fluid. We describe a new in vitro model for in-depth studies of TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis, in which the depletion of identified metabolites limits virus infection. Collectively, this reveals new biomarkers that can differentiate and predict TBEV-associated neurological disease. Additionally, we have identified novel therapeutic targets with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and deepen our understanding of TBEV pathogenesis.

        <tr id="The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of numerous variants with enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. Despite widespread vaccination, infections persist, and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 reprograms host metabolism remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether virus-induced lipid remodeling is conserved across variants and whether changes in lipid abundance correlate with alterations in lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Using global untargeted lipidomics and quantitative proteomics, we analyzed A549-ACE2 cells infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants and compared them to cells infected with the ancestral WA1 strain. In parallel, we conducted quantitative proteomics to assess virus-induced changes in the host proteome. Our results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 drives a remarkably consistent pattern of metabolic rewiring at both the lipidomic and proteomic levels across all three variants. We mapped changes in the expression of host metabolic enzymes and compared these to corresponding shifts in lipid abundance. This integrative analysis identified key host proteins involved in virus-mediated lipid remodeling, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), and ORM1-like protein 2 (ORMDL2). Together, these findings highlight conserved metabolic dependencies of SARS-CoV-2 variants and underscore host lipid metabolism as a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the profound and lasting impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system. Beyond acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent, disrupting immune homeostasis and contributing to persistent inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, neuropathy, and mood disturbances. These are linked to immune dysregulation involving cytokine imbalance, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, glial activation, and T-cell exhaustion. Key biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NFL) correlate with disease severity and chronicity. This narrative review examines the immunopathological mechanisms underpinning the neurological sequelae of long COVID, focusing on neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and molecular mimicry. We also assess the role of viral variants in shaping neuroimmune outcomes and explore emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including biomarker-guided and immune-targeted interventions. By delineating how SARS-CoV-2 reshapes neuroimmune interactions, this review aims to support the development of precision-based diagnostics and targeted therapies for long COVID-related neurological dysfunction. Emerging approaches include immune-modulatory agents (e.g., anti-IL-6), neuroprotective drugs, and strategies for repurposing antiviral or anti-inflammatory compounds in neuro-COVID. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities, personalized therapies guided by biomarkers and patient-specific immune profiles may be essential. Advancements in vaccine technologies and targeted biologics may also hold promise for prevention and disease modification. Finally, continued interdisciplinary research is needed to clarify the complex virus–immune–brain axis in long COVID and inform effective clinical management.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Growing evidence links immune dysfunction, notably impaired IFNγ production, to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), but understanding of the immune phenotype in CPA patients remains limited. Methods To investigate this, we recruited 25 CPA patients and 25 controls with bronchiectasis, isolating immune cells from peripheral blood for detailed flow cytometric phenotyping at resting state and after ex vivo stimulation with the TLR2/Dectin-1 agonist Zymosan. Results CPA patients exhibited pronounced neutrophilia and a reduced frequency of conventional dendritic cell (DC) subsets at baseline compared to bronchiectasis controls. Post-stimulation, DC and monocyte subsets in CPA patients showed significantly lower expression of activation markers. Notably, cDC1s displayed reduced IL-12p40, TNFα, and CD86 expression. CPA patients with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had significantly higher frequencies of activated cDC1s. Machine learning analysis validated these immunological parameters as predictive of CPA status. Conclusion Our findings suggest that immune dysfunction in CPA involves DC and monocyte impairments, potentially contributing to IFNγ deficiency through reduced IL-12 production and co-stimulatory capacity in cDC1s. These results also hint at the presence of innate immune memory in CPA patients with prior TB. Our study advances understanding of the immune dysfunction underlying CPA.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the world with a major public health problem, long COVID (LC), which is estimated to affect over 400 million people worldwide. Many unknowns remain regarding the mechanisms involved in LC. We investigated the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and IFN-γ responses on the development of LC and its various phenotypes. We studied a cohort of 137 convalescents following predominantly mild COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave (2020) and up to one-year post-infection. We found 45% of LC cases that were associated with a greater number and duration of acute-phase symptoms. Cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal symptoms in the acute phase were associated to protection against LC development, while pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, musculoskeletal and other symptoms were associated with increased risk of LC development. Regarding LC phenotypes, we observed risk associations and potentially deleterious effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for LC symptoms classified as general or other. In contrast, for vital organ-related LC symptoms, we found only protective associations, particularly for cardiovascular symptoms, which indeed had a low prevalence in LC (16%). Collectively, our data suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies play a protective role against vital organ-related LC symptoms, especially cardiovascular symptoms, but are insufficient in preventing or limiting other highly prevalent LC symptoms, such as neurological, psychiatric and pulmonary.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced excessive inflammatory response is a key contributor to pathology in respiratory viral infections. However, the underlying mechanisms by which viral infection provokes intense inflammatory reaction and how sustained inflammation leads to tissue damage are not fully understood. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as an example, our research demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce PANoptosis in bystander cells, contributing to the persistence of inflammatory responses. Specifically, the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in infected cells leads to the secretion of 2'3'cGMP-AMP, TNF-α, and IFN-β. These molecules activate STING-induced autophagy-mediated ADAR1 degradation, resulting in the accumulation of Z-nucleic acid, which subsequently triggers ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis in bystander cells. Additionally, inhibiting the cGAS pathway or knocking out STING effectively reduces PANoptosis and alleviates the pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus infection in mouse models. Overall, our findings reveal the unexpected role of PANoptosis in bystander cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection as a mechanism driving pathological damage and persistent inflammatory responses. Targeting this process may offer a promising strategy to mitigate tissue damage in COVID-19 as well as other viral infections and inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes are central mediators of neuroinflammation in several neurodegenerative diseases. Their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. This study aimed to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes were cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a microfluidic coculture platform. This platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of distinct microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 h. Glial activation and interactions were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. LPS stimulation of cocultures induced lower secretion of several inflammatory mediators, suggesting dampening of microglial inflammatory responses when cocultured with astrocytes. Notably, inflammatory interaction between glial cells was demonstrated by increased level of IL-10 after TNF-α/IL-1β stimulation in cocultures compared with monocultures. The microfluidic coculture platform enabled the parallel study of microglial migration, glial activation and phagocytic function, thereby facilitating the investigation of glial responses within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Furthermore, glial inflammatory responses and interactions were demonstrated in the controlled microenvironments of the microfluidic coculture platform. The inflammatory coculture environment was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate inflammatory interaction between iPSC-derived microglia and astrocytes via reciprocal molecular signaling. Importantly, the microfluidic coculture platform established in this study provides a more functional and advanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.

        <tr id="COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), stands as one of the most severe pandemics the world has ever faced in recent times. SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of symptoms, varying from severe manifestations to mild cases and even asymptomatic carriers. This diversity stems from a multitude of factors, including genetic predisposition, viral variants, and immune status. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune system engages pattern recognition receptors, setting off a series of intricate signalling cascades. These cascades culminate in the activation of innate immune responses, including induction of type I and type III interferons. The emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose challenges to the innate immune system defense. Therefore, investigating the innate immune response is crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophoshate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, a critical innate immune mechanism, represents a promising target for intervention at multiple stages to reduce the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review explores innate immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other immune responses critical for SARS-CoV-2 defence. As part of the therapeutic approach, we extend our review to highlight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as emerging and effective therapeutics for controlling SARS-CoV-2 by targeting different stages of the innate immune system. A diverse range of mAbs has been explored to address specific targets within the innate immune pathways. A deep understanding of innate immunity and targeted monoclonal therapeutics will be instrumental in combating viruses and their variants, laying the foundation for enhanced treatment and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background In late 2022, Beijing, China saw a large-scale BF.7 Omicron variant breakthrough infection. However, the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on elderly breakthrough-infected patients’ antibodies and immune cells response was unclear. Methods We recruited 329 inpatients over 65 with BF.7 breakthrough infections. We analyzed the link between vaccination and survival in 67 sampled patients, investigating changes in antibody levels, cytokine profiles, as well as immune phenotypes. Results Experiments revealed that while vaccination could raise antibody levels in the elderly, it showed no significant neutralizing activity against the emerging COVID-19 variant XBB. Flow cytometry showed vaccination increased the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Moreover, we found that elevated frequencies of CD4+ Tsens cells were associated with reduced antigen-specific CD4+ T cell activation, diminished IL-2 production, and lower proportions of Tfh cells, which ultimately leading to impaired neutralizing antibody production, particularly against new emerging variants. Conclusions We found the immunological efficacy of inactivated vaccines in elderly patients is influenced by the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Future elderly vaccination strategies need optimization in dose number and timing, and future vaccine design should aim to minimize the generation of CD4+ senescent T cells.

        <tr id="Different functional T lymphocytes play important roles in the progression of IAV infection, including proliferation, recruitment, and effector activity. However, the immune changes of T cells during IAV infection are unclear, and the related targets are still to be explored. In this study, we used a multi-omics approach combining transcriptome and single-cell transcriptome analysis to identify TXN as a key target gene and elucidate its close association with T-cell proliferation. From these data, we identified 10 key differential genes through a combination of differential analysis, WGCNA, and Friends analysis and further identified that only TXN and S100A6 co-existed in the highly variable genes of proliferative T cells. Because TXN exhibits highly specific high expression in proliferative T cells, we focused on its related research and ultimately identified it as a target gene for IAV infection. Reports have suggested that simultaneous inhibition of the GSH and TXN pathways can effectively trigger cell death. This proves our hypothesis about a new direction of T cell death in IAV infection. Additionally, we found that T cell development after IAV infection was regulated and altered, but this study did not clearly explain whether it was negative regulation. In summary, we have identified TXN as a target gene involved in T cell proliferation during IAV infection, and we suggest that its expression may be associated with non-apoptotic forms of T cell death.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toxoplasma gondii is a foodborne intracellular parasite that chronically infects the brain. Although T. gondii infection elicits a protective immune response, the nature of the monocyte response in the immediate vicinity of parasites during initial brain infection is not well understood. By infecting mice with T. gondii and comparing areas of the brain containing or not containing parasites, we found an increase in CCR2+ monocytes, IBA1+ myeloid cells, GFAP+ astrocytes, and CD68+ signal near parasites in the brain, indicating immune cell infiltration and phagolysosomal activation in response to the infection. CCR2+CD68+ monocytes were specifically increased near tachyzoites with minimal localization of these cells near cysts in the brain. This monocyte response was also detected near parasite-interacted cells, identified using T. gondii parasites that inject Cre recombinase into “interacted” cells of Ai6 CCR2RFP/+ mice, enabling us to track these events in vivo. The chemokine CCL2 and its transcription factor NF-κB were also upregulated surrounding parasites in the brain; however, the T. gondii effector protein GRA15, which sustains NF-κB activation in infected cells, was not required for CCL2 production, NF-κB activation, or myeloid cell recruitment to parasites in the brain. In contrast, active T. gondii replication played a more significant role, as CCR2+ monocytes were recruited to replication-competent but not replication-deficient T. gondii delivered via intracranial injection into mice. These findings provide novel insights into the drivers of immune cell mobilization and activation in the brain during initial T. gondii central nervous system infection and highlight the importance of parasite replication in this process. IMPORTANCE Toxoplasma gondii is a brain-infecting parasite, and the mobilization of peripheral immune cells to the brain is critical for controlling T. gondii infection. However, the initial events driving these cells to sites of T. gondii infection in the brain are poorly understood. We show that peripheral myeloid immune cell recruitment and activation are specific to areas of the brain containing actively replicating parasites, which are capable of lysing host cells. This local immune response is characterized by focal chemokine production, myeloid cell recruitment, and the activation of phagolysosomal pathways. These highly localized host responses were independent of the parasite effector protein that induces NF-κB activation within infected cells, GRA15. However, the localized monocyte recruitment was dependent on live parasites and active parasite replication. This research highlights the importance of host cell sensing of parasite replication in the brain for immune control of T. gondii infection.

        <tr id="Background: Circulating degranulated platelets have been described during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated with COVID-19 complications. This study investigated the relationship between the presence of plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ie, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia), systemic inflammation, and platelet dysfunction in a group of patients with COVID-19. Unlike our previous publication, which focused on platelet characterization, this work explores potential determinants of platelet activation, based on a distinct subset of patients with available stored samples. 
Methods: Patients with COVID-19 were stratified by platelet δ-granule content using the luciferin/luciferase assay into 2 groups: normal (COVδ-norm) and low (COVδ-low). Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia (RT-qPCR), cytokines, and chemokines (Cytometric Bead Array) were quantified on plasma samples. Markers of platelet activation were measured by flow cytometry in whole blood.
Results: A total of 75 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled; 57 presented normal levels of platelet δ-granule content (COVδ-norm) and 18 had low levels of platelet δ-granules (COVδ-low). Groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia levels. Patients in the COVδ-low group showed significantly higher chemokine and cytokine levels compared to those in the COVδ-norm group, with strong correlations between IL-6, as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with platelet degranulation parameters. A similar trend, albeit less pronounced, was observed when patients were stratified based on their platelet activation phenotype. 
Conclusions: These findings suggest that peripheral inflammation, rather than SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, is associated with platelet dysfunction during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction The immune and inflammatory responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in the context of long COVID, remain critical areas of study. Understanding these responses is essential for addressing the long-term health impacts of COVID-19. Recent research also highlights the pivotal role of proteases in modulating immune responses and contributing to disease severity, making them a key focus of our analysis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 72 convalescent COVID-19 patients, assessing recovery at three key time points: immediately post-discharge, one month later, and three months post-infection. Additionally, a subset of 15 patients was followed up two years post-COVID-19. Clinical parameters, including demographics, comorbidities, treatment modalities, and COVID-19 severity, were evaluated. Using CyTOF technology, we characterized over 30 immune cell subsets, including granulocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. We also performed multiplexed analyses of blood samples to profile cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and COVID-19-related proteins. Results Our comprehensive approach revealed significant changes in the immune system over time, highlighting the role of specific immune cells and proteases in the recovery process. Key findings include a decreasing deregulatory effect on immune responses exerted by subsequent SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Delta, and Omicron. Conclusion This study provides an in-depth understanding of the molecular dynamics of immune recovery following COVID-19. By integrating clinical profiling, plasma multiplex analysis, antibody profiling, mass cytometry immunophenotyping, in vitro PBMC stimulation, and the role of proteases, we offer valuable insights into the complex interplay of immune, inflammatory, and protease-mediated responses in individuals recovering from COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Objectives: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are at high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019. It is unclear whether anti-viral cellular and humoral immunity is impacted in patients with ILD in the presence of immune disorders and immunosuppressive therapy. This results in poor control of viral infections following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to highlight the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We compared viral clearance, antibody levels, and T-cell immune response between healthy controls and patients with connective tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Results: Patients with ILD exhibited a higher viral load than the control group (1.58 × 106 vs. 2.37 × 103 copies/mL, p = 0.018), as well as a significantly lower level of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type (WT) virus (7.01 vs. 625.6, p < 0.0001) and Omicron BA.5 (7.19 vs. 128.4, p < 0.001). Similarly, a lower virus-specific T-cell (VST) immune response was observed 14 days post-symptom onset in the ILD group (CD4+ VSTs: 0.018 vs. 0.082, p = 0.005; CD8+ VSTs: 0.0008 vs. 0.047, p = 0.004). The ILD group had no other heightened inflammatory biomarkers compared with the control group. Conclusions: Our study provides novel evidence of the underlying interaction between virus clearance and host immune status and sheds light on the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological alterations, ranging from headache and dizziness to severe encephalopathy and inflammatory neurological diseases (IND), and neuropathological findings suggest immune-mediated processes. Therefore, we sought to characterize profiles of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and markers of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis in COVID-19 patients with neurological alterations to identify key factors and mechanisms underlying CNS disturbances in COVID-19. The study included a case series of 52 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations, which were categorized into three groups: isolated refractory headache (n = 14), encephalopathy (n = 24), and IND (n = 14). Individuals with non-inflammatory, non-infectious neurological conditions (n = 9) were included as negative controls. Paired CSF and serum samples were assessed for 56 biomarkers. Regardless of the neurological condition, COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated CSF levels of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-15, IL-25, IFN-α2, CCL7, CCL11, and GM-CSF. Patients with encephalopathy and IND also showed increased IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, neopterin, IL-7, CXCL8, CXCL9, TGF-α, EGF, sTREM-2, and HMGB1, consistent with a CNS cytokine storm. In contrast, individuals with isolated refractory headache showed a modest inflammatory profile, compatible with the limited CNS involvement. COVID-19 patients showed elevated serum IL-13, IL-18, TNF-α, VILIP-1, TGF-α, and VEGF levels, indicating systemic inflammation and potential blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. β-NGF was increased in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, suggesting the activation of neuroprotective responses during patient recovery. Functional protein network analysis showed a significant enrichment of interactions between factors altered in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, many of them related to processes of neuroinflammation and microglial functions, and leukocyte chemotaxis, activation and proliferation. These findings support a model in which both systemic immune activation and localized neuroinflammation contribute to the diversity of neurological outcomes observed in COVID-19, and dysregulated cytokine production, glial activation, inflammasome activity and BBB disturbances represent key factors in neuro-COVID-19 pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease linked with deregulated immune responses, leading to hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis, often with fatal outcomes. Neutrophils play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, with elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts correlating with disease severity. Despite extensive research, the molecular processes associated with neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 remain elusive. Methods To investigate the molecular signatures underlying neutrophil-driven pathology, we conducted transcriptome analysis in neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients versus healthy individuals. To evaluate the specificity of identified neutrophil signatures in COVID-19, we extended our transcriptomic analysis to neutrophils from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a non-infectious fibrotic lung disease. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining was performed on lung biopsy specimens from IPF patients to validate transcriptomic findings at the tissue level. Results Our analysis revealed significant transcriptional changes in COVID-19 neutrophils, particularly in pathways involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and antiviral responses. Additionally, pathways associated with autophagy and chromatin remodeling were upregulated, while translation-related processes were suppressed, indicating an increased predisposition for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release. This neutrophil transcriptional signature in COVID-19 appears to be associated with the previously reported deregulation of the Activin/Follistatin system in the periphery. Notably, a comparative transcriptomic analysis with neutrophils isolated from IPF patients revealed the induction of substantially overlapping inflammatory processes, suggesting common deregulated responses in COVID-19 and IPF. Consistently, significant NET formation, a hallmark of COVID-19-related inflammation, was observed within lung biopsies from IPF patients. Conclusion By delineating both shared and disease-specific molecular pathways, our findings validate the critical role of neutrophils in COVID-19 and IPF pathophysiology, highlighting their involvement in balancing the inflammatory response across diverse lung diseases.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Herpes simplex virus‐1 (HSV‐1) infections are lifelong and linked to neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), yet the underlying mechanisms in the host remain poorly understood. Methods and Results This study investigates new molecular dynamics following HSV‐1 infection, uncovering the pivotal role of the mixed lineage kinase domain‐like (MLKL) protein. Beyond its known function in necroptosis, MLKL was found to control HSV‐1 transport into the nucleus, tightly regulated by Optineurin (OPTN). We evidenced an essential regulatory interaction between MLKL and OPTN, governing MLKL's activity in both necroptosis‐dependent and independent pathways. In vivo, studies using Optn knockout mice demonstrated how this MLKL‐OPTN axis contributes to demyelination and neurological symptoms mimicking MS. This axis critically prevents oligodendrocyte death and the associated demyelination during HSV‐1 infection. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions with Necrosulfonamide (NSA), an MLKL inhibitor, showed therapeutic potential in preserving myelin integrity and reducing neurological deficits in HSV‐1‐infected models, suggesting a viable strategy for managing virus‐induced neurodegeneration. Conclusion Our findings highlight the significant role of MLKL in HSV‐1 pathogenesis and suggest that MLKL dysregulation is a key mechanism behind severe neurological damage. Key points MLKL plays a significant role in regulating endosomal transport of HSV‐1 to nucleus during early stages of infection. Formation of p‐MLKL bodies during HSV‐1 infection leads to death of oligodendrocyte and subsequent demyelination. OPTN can negatively modulate MLKL levels to restrict infection and consequential oligodendrocyte death during HSV‐1 infection.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the world in 2025. The rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2 results in breakthrough infections and diminishes the efficacy of vaccines and anti-viral drugs. The severity of the disease varies across different variants, and the underlying mechanisms driving these differences remain unclear. This study explores the relationship between different Spike variants and cytotoxicity, aiming to determine whether the humanized decoy receptor ACE2-Fc can neutralize spikes from diverse variants, offering a solution to overcome rapid mutating SARS-CoV-2 induced immune escape. Methods We co-cultured 293 T-ACE2 cells with 293 T cells transfected with various Spike protein variants or used H1650-ACE2 cells transfected with these Spike variants. This allowed us to observe the effects of different Spike mutations, specifically focusing on cell fusion, cytotoxicity, and cytokine release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry is employed to determine if ACE2-Fc can recognize different Spike variants. We also assess the ability of ACE2-Fc to inhibit infection, cell fusion, cytotoxicity, and cytokine release through pseudovirus infections or Spike protein transfections. Additionally, we use actual viruses from SARS-CoV-2 patients to validate the impacts of Spike mutations and the effectiveness of ACE2-Fc. Furthermore, human plasma is utilized to evaluate ACE2-Fc’s capability to inhibit Spike-induced clot formation. Results We found that different Spike variants, particularly those with enhancements at the S2' site, increased cell–cell fusion capability, which correlated positively with cytotoxicity and cytokine IL-6 and TNF-α released from PBMCs. ACE2-Fc recognized spikes from wide-range of variants, including wild type, Alpha, Delta, Delta plus, Lambda, BA.2, BA.2.75, BA.5, BF.7, BQ.1, XBB.1, JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3, and effectively prevented these spike-expressing pseudo-viruses from entering host cells. Crucially, ACE2-Fc can prevent spike-induced cell fusion, thereby reducing subsequent cytotoxicity and the release of IL-6 and TNF-α from PBMCs. ACE2-Fc also effectively reduces plasma clot formation induced by trimeric spike proteins. Conclusions These findings demonstrated that ACE2-Fc could effectively combat the infection of rapidly mutating SARS-CoV-2, providing a potential solution to overcome immune evasion.

        <tr id="The virus known to cause COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, exhibits severe and complex neurological symptoms. These effects may be attributed to a virus-induced neuroinflammatory environment, warranting exploration of the respiratory centers of the brain, namely the pons and medulla, specifically in relation to neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neuronal death in response to COVID-19. Interestingly, older adults with neurological dysfunction maintained on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, such as memantine, had reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate (1) the neuroinflammatory response to COVID-19 in the respiratory centers of the brain, and (2) to assess the extent to which NMDAR antagonists offer neuroprotective measures in the context of COVID-19. In a susceptible mouse model, animals inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 were pre-treated with either memantine or an alternative NMDAR antagonist, ifenprodil. Inoculated animals had poor survival and showed signs of neuroinflammation, evidenced by a reduction in morphological structure, demyelination, and changes in astrocyte and microglial expression in the pons and medulla. Mice pre-treated with memantine showed improved survival when challenged with COVID-19 and a reduction in virus-induced neuroinflammatory impairments. Our findings support the further investigation of memantine for the prevention of COVID-19 induced neuroinflammation and resultant neurological symptoms and shed light on the possible protective mechanism of memantine in the elderly maintained on NMDAR antagonists.">

        <tr id="Rasmussen Encephalitis (RE) is a chronic, unilateral epileptic disorder mostly found in children. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by T lymphocyte infiltration targeting neurons and leading to microglia activation, astrogliosis, and cortical degeneration. Within a patient’s brain, distinct pathological stages are found that offer a unique opportunity to study T cell dynamics in situ. Using quantitative multiplex fluorescence imaging, we analyzed CD103+ and CD69+ Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) across different disease stages. This analysis revealed that TRM were more abundant in the parenchyma than in the perivascular space, suggesting that their differentiation occurs locally after antigen encounter. Further, part of the TRM expressed Granzyme-B (GrB) and frequently were attached to neurons, suggesting that they are actively involved in neuronal destruction. While TRM showed a stage-dependent increase in older lesions, the proportions of these cells did not correlate with disease duration, indicating that their accumulation may be more dependent on the local environment in the lesion than on the length of the disease. In addition, we found that T cells using the γδ T cell receptor comprised up to 66%. Like CD8+ T cells, the γδ T cells could develop a TRM phenotype and, while expressing GrB+ granules, they were seen attached to neurons, suggesting that they are involved in neuronal destruction. Finally, analysis of exhaustion- and TRM-associated immune checkpoint control markers PD-1 and LAG-3 revealed a significant stage-dependent increase in PD-1 expression in the oldest lesions. In contrast, LAG-3 expression did not show any stage-specific pattern, pointing towards a distinct regulatory mechanism. The study demonstrates a dynamic and one-way T cell response throughout the course of RE at a given spot in the CNS: from the establishment of T cell residence after entry into the CNS, the killing of neurons, and eventually T cell exhaustion. It further suggests an important role of γδ T-cells in the propagation of disease and lesions.

        <tr id="Background Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition (here abbreviated as post-COVID) is an escalating global health issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of post-COVID following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and anxiety. Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol. Results We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent. Conclusions Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.">

NK cell activity, including cytokine secretion, cytotoxic activity, and the coordination of inhibitory and activating receptors, linking innate and adaptive immunity, among others, has been examined for numerous pathogens, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses. The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 health crisis has exposed a deficiency in understanding the previously elucidated mechanisms; the rationale for the reported variability in symptomatology among COVID-19 patients is extensive and intricate. It is evident that NK cells exert a significant influence on symptom severity, and their absence, with the presence or absence of their surface receptors, elicits a tailored response to the virus. This overview examines the impact of NK cells on the progression of several viral diseases, emphasizing their involvement in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 via the activation of surface receptors.">

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="Viral infections have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), an immune-mediated disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Since Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) can induce MS-like demyelination, TMEV infection is the most widely used viral model for MS. Although the precise pathophysiology is unknown, altered fecal bacterial populations were associated with distinct immune gene expressions in the CNS. We aimed to determine the role of gut microbiota in TMEV infection by administering an antibiotic cocktail in drinking water before (prophylactic administration) or after (therapeutic administration) TMEV infection. The antibiotic administration reduced total eubacteria, including the phyla Bacillota and Bacteroidota, but increased the phylum Pseudomonadata in feces. Prophylactic administration did not alter TMEV-induced inflammatory demyelination clinically or histologically, without changes in anti-viral IgG1/IgG2c levels or lymphoproliferative responses; therapeutic administration temporarily suppressed the neurological signs. Although antibiotic treatment had minimal effects on TMEV infection, adding metronidazole and ampicillin in drinking water substantially reduced water intake in the antibiotic group of mice, resulting in significant body weight loss. Since dehydration and stress could affect immune responses and gut microbiota, caution should be exercised when planning or evaluating the oral antibiotic cocktail treatment in experimental animals.">

        <tr id="Although SARS-CoV-2 reinfections remain a concern for healthcare systems worldwide, the factors driving them are still not fully understood. In this study, we examined data for 3303 individuals who experienced two SARS-CoV-2 infections between March 2020 and May 2022 from both clinical and viral genomics perspectives. Our findings indicate that viral evolution was the primary driver of reinfection. However, chronic conditions were common among reinfected individuals, including those under 26 years old, suggesting that the presence of underlying and/or chronic conditions increases susceptibility to reinfection. The median time elapsed between infections was one year, often coinciding with the emergence of new variants. While vaccination showed only a limited protective effect against reinfection, it drastically decreased the hospitalization rate, underscoring its role in mitigating disease severity. Our findings point to the need for more flexible vaccination strategies, especially for individuals with chronic conditions. Understanding the interactions between host factors and viral evolution is critical to strengthening prevention strategies and reducing the burden of reinfections and their possible long-term complications.">

        <tr id="Background: Currently the role of dengue virus (DENV) specific T cell responses in disease pathogenesis and protection are not well understood, including potential differences in those who have obesity. We sought to investigate the functionality and phenotype of T cells in patients with acute dengue fever (DF) or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Methods: T cell function was assessed in patients with DF (n=50) and DHF (n=12), recruited within 4 days of illness and again on day 5 to 7, using 109 peptides representing CD8+ T cell epitopes and 90 peptides targeting CD4+ T cell epitopes. Phenotypic analysis was in DF (n=21) and DHF patients (n=21), recruited between days 6 to 8 since onset of illness, by multicolor flow cytometry. Results: The frequency of ex vivo IFN{gamma} ELISpot responses to both the CD4+ and CD8+ peptides pools significantly increased from the first to second time point in patients with DF (p<0.0001) but not with DHF. The frequency of ex vivo IFN{gamma} ELISpot responses to CD4+ (p=0.001) and CD8+ peptides pools (p=0.0002) also significantly increased from the first to second time point in lean patients compared obese patients. Cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen (CLA) expression was significantly higher in the CD8+ T cell subset in patients with DF and DHF compared to HC and these differences were most significant in CD8+CD45RA- T cells. CD8+CD45RA-CLA+ T cells consisted of >50% of the T cells in 9/21 patients with DHF, with 92.7% expressing CD38. CLA expression was highest in the CD8+CD45RA- of obese individuals, which was significantly higher compared to lean individuals (p=0.01). CD27 and CD127 were both significantly downregulated in patients with DHF compared to DF, with ICOS expression being significantly higher in CD8+ T cells in DHF. Discussion: Patients with DHF and obese individuals had impaired T cell functionality. Activated and skin homing CD8+ T cells were associated with DHF, with downregulation of CD27 and CD127. Therefore, the role of skin homing T cells, which have impaired functionality in disease pathogenesis, should be further investigated.">

        <tr id="The ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants highlights the importance of monitoring immune responses to guide vaccination strategies. Although neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) have garnered increasing attention, T-cells are crucial for conferring long-lasting immunity, especially their resilience against viral mutations. However, assessing T-cell responses clinically has been hindered by cost and complexity. In this study, we recruited a cohort of 134 healthy adults, who had been immunized with three doses of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine. Cellular immunity elicited by a comprehensive array of overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the virus’s structural proteins was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Additionally, a dataset including demographic information, routine blood indices, and immune cell indicators comprising 32 variables was collected. Multivariate analysis revealed age and days post-vaccination as key factors influencing the strength of the T-cell response. Importantly, random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were employed, along with 8 easily accessible indicators to formulate predictive models for the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Besides, these models demonstrated substantial accuracy (r > 0.9) in both the training and testing sets. Our findings offer an efficient and economical methodology for evaluating the T-cell reactions in healthy adults following inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, which is visualizable and easy to use, providing a novel strategy for assessing cellular immunity after vaccination.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT At the COVID-19 pandemic onset, convalescent plasma, collected from patients recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, emerged as a potential treatment option, but the effect on the patient immune response was unclear. To determine treatment effect on the infection antibody response, plasma samples were collected through 90 days from 104 SARS-CoV-2-infected participants after receiving CCP or control plasma, as part of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled early treatment trial. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was used to quantify binding IgG, IgA, and IgM to nucleocapsid (N) protein and IgG to the USA-WA1/2020 spike (S) protein. Avidity assessed antibody maturation. CCP transfusion boosted post-transfusion plasma levels of N-specific IgG, but not IgA or IgM and had a lesser effect on S-specific IgG. Over the first 2 weeks, both trial arm groups generated IgM, IgA, and IgG to N and IgG to S with comparable levels at 14–90 days after transfusion. Levels of IgM and IgA subsequently declined, while IgG was maintained through day 90 for both interventions. Avidity of N-specific IgG increased steadily over the 3-month follow-up in both groups, but S-specific IgG avidity improved only for those in the CCP group. Improved antibody titer correlated with improved avidity over time in both groups. Antibody levels and avidity between early ves late transfusion from symptom onset by trial arm intervention were also similar. In summary, CCP administration had no negative effects on the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and was associated with qualitatively improved antibodies with higher avidity. IMPORTANCE Monoclonal antibody infusion prevented COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, the massive monoclonal antibody dose, near 7% of total circulating antibodies, has been shown to decrease patient generation of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and lower responses to vaccination, possibly by decreasing generation of high avidity neutralization epitopes near the monoclonal binding epitope. We characterized diverse antibody population quality and quantity among intervention groups in the polyclonal COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) randomized control trial, effective in reducing hospitalizations by more than 50% in all participants and 80% in those receiving transfusions with symptom onset before 5 days. Importantly, we observed a greater anti-nucleocapsid compared to anti-Spike antibody level immediately after transfusion. CCP compared to controls did not alter IgG, IgA, or IgM to nucleocapsid or IgG-spike. CCP was associated with greater IgG-nucleocapsid and, to a lesser extent, IgG-spike avidity maturation over follow-up compared to control. CCP transfusions lacked negative effects on antibody levels and avidity. Monoclonal antibody infusion prevented COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Neurological symptoms associated with long COVID include anxiety, depression, and memory impairment. However, the exact underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Using golden hamsters as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persistently infect the brain, as viral RNA and replicative virus are detected in the brainstem 80 days after the initial infection. Infected hamsters exhibit a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, characterized by overexpression of innate immunity genes, and altered expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, in energy metabolism, and in proteostasis. These infected animals exhibit persistent depression-like behavior, impaired short-term memory, and late-onset signs of anxiety. Finally, we provide evidence that viral and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, contributing to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.">

        <tr id="Both bacterial and viral infections can trigger an overwhelming host response, leading to immunopathology and organ dysfunction. Multiple studies have reported dysregulated myeloid cell states in patients with bacterial sepsis or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their relevance to viral infections other than COVID-19, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a multi-cohort analysis of single cell and bulk transcriptomic data from 1845 patients across 25 studies. Our meta-analysis revealed a conserved severity-associated gene signature pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM) and increased IL1R2 expression in monocytes and neutrophils from patients with bacterial sepsis, COVID-19, and influenza. Analysis of tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients showed that IL-6 signaling blockade partially reduces this signature and results in a compensatory increase in G-CSF. To validate the role of these cytokines in vivo, we used a mouse model of influenza infection that recapitulates severity-associated increases in IL1R2+ monocytes and IL1R2hi neutrophils, and demonstrate that combined IL-6 and G-CSF blockade inhibits their production. Our study demonstrates the cooperative role of G-CSF and IL-6 in driving the production of severity-associated IL1R2+ myeloid cells and highlights the link between myeloid dysregulation and tissue injury during severe infection.">

We conducted a metabolic profiling of 147 children’s serum samples, including acute COVID-19 patients, MIS-C patients, and healthy controls. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, we measured 1101 metabolites. The results revealed distinct metabolic profiles in acute COVID-19 and MIS-C patients, with significant alterations in lipid classes. Both conditions exhibited an elevated Apo-B100/Apo-A1 ratio and increased serum inflammatory markers. MIS-C patients showed unique disruptions, including increased triglycerides and altered lipoprotein composition. Despite milder clinical respiratory symptoms, children’s metabolic disturbances mirrored those seen in severe adult COVID-19 patients, indicating a shared inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. This suggests potential long-term health impacts, underscoring the need for continued research into the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 in children.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to human health. The outcome of IAV results from the viral-host interaction, with the underlying molecular mechanisms largely unknown. By integrating the plasma proteomics data of the IAV-infected patients into the viral-inflammation protein-protein interaction (VI-PPI) network created in this study, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), the critical enzyme in purine salvage, was identified as a potential hub gene that connected the different stages of IAV infection. Extended survival rates and reduced pulmonary inflammatory lesions were observed in alveolar epithelial cell (AEC)-specific PNP conditional knockout mice upon H1N1 infection. Mechanistically, PB1-F2 of IAV was revealed as a novel viral transcriptional factor to bind to the TATA box of PNP promoter, leading to enhanced purine salvage in H1N1-challenged AECs. The activation of PNP-mediated purine salvage was verified in IAV-infected patients and A549 cells. PNP knockdown elicited a purine metabolic shift from augmented salvage pathway to de novo synthesis, constraining both viral infection and pro-inflammatory signaling through APRT-AICAR-AMPK activation. Moreover, durdihydroartemisinin (DHA), predicted by VI-PPI as a novel PNP inhibitor, exerted beneficial effects on the survival and weight gain of H1N1-challenged mice via its direct binding to PNP. To reveal for the first time, we found that PNP, activated by IAV, plays a hub role within H1N1-host interaction, simultaneously modulating viral replication and hyperinflammation through purine salvage. Our study sheds new light on a “two-for-one” strategy by targeting purine salvage in combating IAV-related pathology, suggesting PNP as a potential novel anti-influenza host target.">

        <tr id="The soluble S1 subunit of Spike protein (SP) from the SARS‐CoV-2 of different variants of concern (VOCs) may directly bind and activate human NK cells in vitro through the engagement of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4. This mechanism revealed a novel pathogenic role played by NK cells not only in the different phases of disease but also in the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) and some post-vaccination side effects. In addition to its binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates virus attachment and cell entry, soluble SP triggers several active receptors/molecules expressed by many cells, inducing, in turn, type I/III interferon decrease, altered autophagy and apoptosis, the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, complement activation and endothelial damage, which favour clotting events. In this review, we discuss the hypothesis that circulating SP, exerting multiple biological activities, can explain the heterogeneity of the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19, PASC and post-vaccine-related effects. Recent reports have clearly indicated that soluble SARS-CoV-2 and post-vaccination SP trigger the same cascade of events, acting on the immune response and promoting defined adverse events. Factors hindering the pathological activity of soluble SP are the SP plasma levels, the age of the infected/vaccinated people and the efficiency of protein synthesis of ectopic targets triggered by soluble SP, as well as the specificity, the titre and the affinity of anti-SP antibodies elicited by the infection. At present, the risk/benefit ratio is largely in favour of vaccination; however, the excessive and persistent ectopic production of synthetic SP should be systematically analysed. This would allow for the identification of subjects at risk for major adverse events and to answer the urgent need for efficient vaccines that provide long-lasting activity with minimal side effects.">

        <tr id="Purpose The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 and RA through immune inflammation. Methods First, we conducted a meta-analysis on the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization rate, and mortality rate for patients with RA. Then, Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate the causal relationship between COVID-19 and RA, and further analyzed the cytokines and immune cells in COVID-19 and RA. Finally, we obtained microarray datasets of COVID-19, RA patients, and normal controls from the GEO database. And performed functional, pathway enrichment, and immune cell infiltration analysis on differentially expressed genes between each group. Results The meta-analysis results suggested that the hospitalization rate and mortality rate of RA patients infected with COVID-19 were higher than those of the control population. MR analysis showed a positive correlation between COVID-19 infection and RA. We also found that interleukin 13 was associated with RA and COVID-19 infection. CD27 on IgD + CD24 + B cells and CD3 on CD39 + CD8 + T cells are common immune cell phenotypes in two diseases. In addition, COVID-19 function is enriched in immune responses mediated by leukocytes and neutrophils, while RA is significantly enriched in the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. The results of immune cell infiltration showed that both diseases had more neutrophils and fewer CD8 T cells. Conclusion There are many similarities between COVID-19 and RA in immune inflammatory responses such as cytokines and immune cells. COVID-19 may lead to the development of RA through immune inflammation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40659-025-00620-7.">

        <tr id="Background Infection with enteric bacterial pathogens continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. These pathogens include enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, which transit the intestinal tract, efface microvilli, and attach firmly to intestinal epithelial cells predominantly in the colon. Investigation of these human-adapted pathogens has been greatly aided by mouse models of infection. The mouse-adapted attaching and effacing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium utilizes many similar mechanisms of pathogenesis, including the use of a type III secretion system, and virulence factors encoded in a locus of enterocyte effacement. Although this model has allowed for assessing the complexity of the host response, the complex interplay between the nervous and immune systems in response to infection remains incomplete. Methods We assessed the role of sensory neurotransmitters encoded by the Tac1 gene in the host response to C. rodentium. Results Tac1-deficient mice had significantly reduced pathogen shedding and colonic bacterial burden, accompanied by decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In accordance with reduced chemokine production, we observed reduced colonic recruitment of specific immune cell populations in Tac1-/- compared to WT mice. Conclusions Sensory neuropeptides regulate key aspects of enteric bacterial infection and may serve as unique targets in the treatment of enteric disease.">

        <tr id="As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, the extent of their impact on shaping population immunity through repeated waves remains poorly understood. This study assessed age-specific immune responses and the effects of vaccination on neutralization against wild-type (WT) and JN.1 variants. We analyzed 4,371 serum samples from individuals aged 6 months–80 years (May-August 2024). We found that 95.1% of participants had detectable anti-N Ig, suggesting widespread prior infection. Among unvaccinated children (6 months–4 years), 96.5% exhibited anti-RBD or anti-N Ig antibodies mostly from asymptomatic infections. Neutralization against JN.1 did not significantly differ by age, but children aged 6 months–4 years exhibited higher JN.1 neutralization than WT, while individuals aged ≥ 12 years showed the opposite pattern. Unvaccinated individuals demonstrated stronger neutralization against JN.1, whereas vaccinated participants had lower neutralization against JN.1 relative to WT, regardless of vaccine dose. No significant differences in JN.1 neutralization were observed across vaccine doses or age groups. Although 86.5% of participants exhibited neutralizing activity against JN.1, the titers remained relatively low. These findings highlight that almost all children experienced asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that natural exposure maintains immunity in adults. Infection-driven boosting may improve community-wide protection and alleviate immune imprinting, offering key insights for optimizing vaccine strategies.

        <tr id="Long Covid is a post‐viral syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms targeting multiple organ systems after initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Current literature suggests that the mechanisms causing Long Covid involve viral persistence, immune dysregulation, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. By forming reservoirs in the tissues of various organs, SARS‐CoV‐2 may evade immunological clearances while triggering immune responses and contributing to chronic symptoms through cytokine imbalances, T‐cell exhaustion, and systemic inflammation. These symptoms parallel other post‐viral syndromes such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting similar mechanisms of pathology. The coronavirus has also been linked to neuroinflammation and endothelial dysfunction causing cognitive symptoms and cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, its ability to lower energy production links it to post‐exertion malaise (PEM) and muscle pain. These symptoms may result from iron dysregulation and persistent oxidative stress due to Covid‐impaired mitochondrial function. This review synthesizes current data on the mechanisms that drive Long Covid pathogenesis and explores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate viral persistence, immune dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. It is critical to understand these interactions to develop targeted interventions that address the long‐term sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in millions of deaths globally. Adults with immunosuppression (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients) and those undergoing active cancer treatments experience worse infections and more severe COVID-19. It is difficult to conduct clinical studies in these populations, resulting in a restricted amount of data that can be used to relate mechanisms of immune dysfunction to COVID-19 outcomes in these vulnerable groups. To study immune dynamics after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to investigate drivers of COVID-19 severity in individuals with cancer and immunosuppression, we adapted our mathematical model of the immune response during COVID-19 and generated virtual patient cohorts of cancer and immunosuppressed patients. The cohorts of plausible patients recapitulated available longitudinal clinical data collected from patients in Montréal, Canada area hospitals. Our model predicted that both cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients with severe COVID-19 had decreased CD8 + T cells, elevated interleukin-6 concentrations, and delayed type I interferon peaks compared to those with mild COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, our results suggest that cancer patients experience higher viral loads (however, with no direct relation with severity), likely because of decreased initial neutrophil counts (i.e., neutropenia), a frequent toxic side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, severe cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients suffered a high degree of tissue damage associated with elevated neutrophils. Lastly, parameter values associated with monocyte recruitment by infected cells were found to be elevated in severe cancer and immunosuppressed patients with respect to the COVID-19 reference group. Together, our study highlights that dysfunctions in type I interferon and CD8 + T cells are key drivers of immune dysregulation in COVID-19, particularly in cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals.">

        <tr id="Leishmania is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease prevalent in 97 countries. Co-infection with HIV increases susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis (VL), accelerating HIV’s progression to AIDS. Managing VL in HIV-infected individuals is challenging due to atypical presentations and limited therapeutic responses, highlighting the need to develop new disease management strategies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great promise for this goal as they can be used for a higher understanding of biological processes and biomarker discovery. In this context, a proteomic analysis was carried out from plasma-EVs of an HIV/VL patient over two years and compared to HIV and healthy controls. The analysis confirmed classical EV markers but showed limited detection of Leishmania proteins. However, variations in human protein abundance related to relevant immunological processes were observed. Notably, the macrophage receptor with a collagenous structure (MARCO) was consistently detected only in the patient and not in the control groups. Significantly, the relevance of MARCO as a possible VL biomarker was confirmed using a validation cohort with five VL patients and its detection by Western Blot was possible. Although MARCO warrants further investigation as a VL related biomarker, the study of EVs confirmed their promise of being a privileged window into this disease. Future studies are needed to broaden data on EVs in infections to improve clinical management.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world, but our understanding of causation is still lacking. A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD. Methods This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation. Results Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Discussion Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.">

        <tr id="Abstract Arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV), Ross River (RRV), and O’nyong nyong virus (ONNV), are emerging and reemerging viruses that cause disease characterized by fever, rash, and incapacitating muscle and joint pain and inflammation. Alphavirus infection induces robust immune responses, leading to the upregulation of several cytokines and chemokines, including chemokine C ligand 4 (CCL4). CCL4 is a chemoattractant for immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, recruiting these cells to the site of infection, stimulating the release of proinflammatory mediators, and inducing T cell differentiation. CCL4 has been found at high levels in both the acute and chronic phases of chikungunya disease; however, the role of CCL4 in arthritogenic alphavirus disease development remains unexplored. Here, we tested the effect of CCL4 on MAYV infection in mice through antibody neutralization and treatment with recombinant mouse CCL4. We observed no differences in mice depleted of CCL4 or treated with recombinant CCL4 in terms of disease progression such as weight loss and footpad swelling or the development of viremia. CCL4 uses the G protein-coupled receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). To determine whether CCR5 deficiency would alter disease outcomes or virus replication in mice, we inoculated CCR5 knockout (CCR5−−) mice with MAYV and observed no effect on disease development and immune cell profile of blood and footpads between CCR5−/− and wild type mice. These studies failed to identify a clear role for CCL4 or its receptor CCR5 in MAYV infection.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and systemic immune responses, particularly through the gut–lung axis. Disruptions in gut microbial diversity and function—commonly referred to as dysbiosis—have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we assessed the gut bacteriome and permeability in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using 16S sequencing and ELISA assays, respectively. We also measured blood inflammatory cytokines and fecal secretory IgA to evaluate systemic and mucosal immune responses. Significant alterations in both alpha and beta diversity metrics were observed in patients with COVID-19 (n = 79) and those with post-COVID-19 condition (n = 141) compared to the controls (n = 97). Differential abundance and taxonomic analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles in the infected groups. Increased plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and zonulin were detected in patient samples. Some genera were elevated during acute infection, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia-Shigella were associated with increased zonulin levels, indicating compromised intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that gut dysbiosis may contribute to bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the gut–lung axis and suggest that modulating the gut microbiota could support immune regulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Understanding the intricacies of the host inflammatory response to coronaviruses is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to mitigate the severe consequences of these infections. Various coronaviruses can trigger the host immune response, leading to highly similar inflammatory reactions. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which belongs to the same group of beta-coronaviruses as SARS-CoV-2 and induces high pathogenicity in mice, typically serves as a safety model for investigating highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, replication, and virus-host interactions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) infected with MHV. Results We characterized the global gene changes at both the mRNA and protein levels following viral infection, identifying ten genes involved in various anti-MHV biological processes. Furthermore, by integrating our findings with relevant published data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells, we observed significant similarities in the responses to MHV and SARS-CoV-2, particularly regarding immune and inflammatory responses. Discussion These findings underscore how our research enhances the understanding of global gene expression alterations during coronavirus infection and facilitates the identification of novel antiviral targets.">

        <tr id="Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) remains a global health issue and still drives the development of significant pathology and various comorbidities. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively suppress viral replication but is often initiated months or years after initial infection, leaving a substantial period in which viral replication progresses unchecked. While ART suppresses HIV-1 replication, it does not prohibit the development of HIV-1-associated comorbidities, highlighting a lack of understanding in the connection between replication and HIV-1-associated pathogeneses. Thus, it is critical to better define HIV-1 replication dynamics to more effectively target different stages of the viral replication cycle in distinct cell populations. Here, we show a high-content imaging reporter assay that uses modified human osteosarcoma cells expressing HIV-1 receptors (GHOST cells) which fluoresce in response to HIV-1 infection. These cells have been previously used to assess HIV-1 infectivity and tropism, but this modified assay enables rapid evaluation of large numbers of samples with consistency and replicability, while also easily integrating into existing experimental pipelines that analyze p24 secretion in collected supernatants. This also allows for direct correlation between infectivity and p24 secretion, resulting in a deeper interrogation and more robust understanding of HIV-1 infection kinetics. Institutional Permissions All of the primary cells used in this study were obtained from donors in accordance with Institutional Review Board protocols at the New York Blood Center and Drexel University. All studies using primary cells were performed with cells from deidentified donors and were found by the Institutional Review Board at Drexel University to be exempt from human subjects protocols (protocol number 2208009386). All experiments using in vitro cell lines or primary human cells were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee and at Drexel University. Highlights The current toolkit for evaluating in vitro HIV-1 infection dynamics does not currently include an assay providing direct, efficient assessments of infectivity in large numbers of samples. Direct assessment of viral infectivity longitudinally alongside other measurements of viral infection such as p24 secretion or amount of proviral DNA enables correlation of different stages of viral replication efficiency over time. The high-content viral titer assay described here correlates with widely used surrogate measures of viral infectivity, such as p24 secretion, and integrates easily into existing experimental pipelines that collect supernatant from infected cultures. Adapting fluorescent reporter assays to a high-content imaging and analysis pipeline creates a high-throughput assay of direct infectivity that enables evaluation of changes in infectivity across multiple treatments or timepoints and integrates easily into existing experimental pipelines that collect supernatant from infected cultures.">

        <tr id="Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) represent one of the most susceptible populations for developing severe COVID-19, and a unique human genetic condition for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility of neurologically vulnerable individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human Chromosome-21 (HSA21) triplication in DS causes global transcriptional deregulation, affecting multiple genes that may directly (e.g., TMPRSS2) or indirectly influence the SARS-CoV-2 entry into central nervous system (CNS) cells. The anti-viral immune response may also be altered in cells with trisomy-21 (T21) due to triplication of genes encoding for several interferon receptor subunits and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we demonstrate that human cells derived from fetal cortical specimens and maintained in primary cultures are susceptible to infection with a molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to express the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and to authentic SARS-CoV-2. The level of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cultures originated from different cortical specimens varied, seemingly depending on ploidy and chromosomal sex of the cells. We confirmed the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cultures and found that XY T21 group had the highest TMPRSS2 mRNA levels, which was associated with increased infectivity in XY—compared to XX T21 cultures. The XX T21 cultures exhibited elevated expression of several ISGs (MX1, STAT1, and STAT2) which was associated with lower infectivity. The comparisons of postmortem aged brain specimens revealed reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2, but elevated STAT2 protein levels in individuals with DS and Alzheimer’s disease (DS-AD) compared to control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) group. Collectively, these results suggest multifactorial regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cortical cells that involves ploidy, chromosomal sex, and the expression of genes implicated in regulation of virus entry and anti-viral response as contributing factors.

The pathogenesis of this persistent post Covid-19 Condition (PCC) is, however, largely unknown. We hypothesized that persistent T cell activation and exhaustion play a role in PCC development. Methods We examined plasma levels of soluble (s) CD25, TIM-3 and LAG-3, all markers of T cell activation/exhaustion, by enzyme immunoassays in 170 home-isolated and 53 hospitalized patients for up to 18 months after COVID-19 in relation to persistent symptomatology. Results Our major findings were: (i) Cases with persistent dyspnea and fatigue had markedly higher sCD25 at 6–18 months with a more modest increase in sTIM-3. (ii) Cases with memory problems at 12–18 months had increased sLAG-3 iii) sCD25 correlated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and microneutralization titers only in cases with PCC while sTIM-3 correlated with these parameters irrespectively of symptoms. iv) Although hospitalized patients had markedly elevated levels of T cell activation/exhausting markers during follow-up, there was no relation to PCC symptoms. Conclusion Our study indicates a role for T cell activation/exhaustion in PCC following home isolated COVID-19 infection, with somewhat different patterns of sCD25, sTIM-3 and sLAG-3, but not in hospitalized COVID-19 patients where disease severity may be more important.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and often exhibit reduced vaccine efficacy due to chronic immunosuppression. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, understanding immune responses following natural infection remains critical for informing protection strategies in this vulnerable population. We conducted a longitudinal study of SOT recipients who had recovered from Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 infection, evaluating immune responses to the JN.1 subvariant at 4-6 weeks and 1 year postinfection.


METHODS
Neutralizing antibodies to JN.1 were measured using a pseudovirus neutralization assay, and JN.1-specific T-cell responses were assessed by flow cytometry. Frequencies of bulk T-cells and innate immune cells, identified via flow cytometry, and their correlation with adaptive responses were also analyzed.


RESULTS
At 4-6 weeks, 30% of participants had detectable JN.1-neutralizing antibodies, rising to 43% at one year, although titers remained low. In contrast, CD4⁺ T-cell responses were robust and detected in 75%-83% of participants at 4-6 weeks, increasing to 75%-93% by 1 year. CD8⁺ T-cell responses were observed less frequently. Exploratory correlations between innate and bulk T-cell subsets with heterologous adaptive immune responses were investigated but did not reveal statistically significant relationships.


CONCLUSION
These findings offer important insights into the durability and breadth of immunity following natural infection in immunocompromised transplant recipients. While heterologous neutralizing antibodies were limited, sustained CD4+ T-cell responses may help mitigate severe disease following exposure to JN.1-derived variants, which continue to dominate the SARS-CoV-2 landscape.">

        <tr id="Background The interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections presents a critical challenge to immunopathogenesis. While HIV infection induces progressive CD4+ T cell depletion and chronic immune dysfunction, SARS-CoV-2 triggers complex host responses, ranging from localized antiviral defense to systemic hyperinflammation. We aimed to illustrate the plasma proteomic profiles of hospitalized patients coinfected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Methods Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze the plasma protein profiles in three matched groups: (1) seven hospitalized patients with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, (2) seven people living with HIV (PLWH) who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and (3) seven healthy controls. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed on the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Results We quantified 5,373 proteins across 21 samples and identified significant alterations in multiple proteins in people living with HIV (PLWH) with COVID-19 compared to both PLWH and healthy controls. These DEPs were associated with inflammatory responses, immune cell migration, degranulation, and, notably, the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition, we identified DEPs associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral receptors, proteases, transcription factors, and kinases. Conclusions The proteomic profile highlighted the disruption caused by COVID-19 in immunomodulation, thrombosis, and viral entry pathways in PLWH. Further validation of these signatures could improve risk stratification and tailored interventions for this vulnerable patient cohort.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT NK cells are critical for immunosurveillance, yet become dysfunctional when chronically stimulated by virally infected or cancerous cells. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less characterized, limiting therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, with remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3‐expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating, and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Whilst COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory infection, few studies have characterized the immune response to COVID-19 in lung tissue. We sought to understand the pathogenic role of microenvironmental interactions and the extracellular matrix in post-mortem COVID-19 lung using an integrative multi-omic approach.


METHODS
Post-mortem formalin fixed paraffin embedded lung tissue from fatal COVID-19 and non-respiratory death control lung underwent multi-omic evaluation by Quantseq Bulk RNA sequencing, Nanostring GeoMX spatial transcriptomics, RNAscope, multiplex immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, to evaluate virus distribution, immune composition and the extracellular matrix. Markers of extracellular synthesis and breakdown were measured in the serum of 215 patients with COVID-19 and 54 healthy volunteer controls by ELISA.


RESULTS
We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was restricted to the pneumocytes and macrophages of early-stage disease. Spatial analyses revealed an immunosuppressive virus microenvironment, enriched for PDL1+IDO1+ macrophages and depleted of T-cells. Oligoclonal T-cells in COVID-19 lung showed no enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell receptors. Collagen VI was upregulated and contributed to alveolar wall thickening and impaired gas exchange in COVID-19 lung. Serum from COVID-19 patients showed increased levels of PRO-C6, a marker of collagen VI synthesis, predicted mortality in hospitalized patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data refine the current model of respiratory COVID-19 with regard to virus distribution, immune niches, and the role of the non-cellular microenvironment in pathogenesis and risk stratification in COVID-19. We show that collagen deposition is an early event in the course of the disease.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes infiltrate the CNS in response to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and form a pool of long-lived brain tissue-resident memory T-cells (bTRMs), which display markers of residency (i.e., CD103, CD69, CD49a). However, the functional role of these bTRMs is still unknown. By 30 days postinfection, a latent viral brain infection was established, as indicated by absence of viral transcripts (IE1, E1, and gB) produced during productive infection. Following intracerebroventricular injection of either depleting α-CD8 Ab (clone YTS169.4) or α-CD103-sap (clone IT50) into the brain, 90–95% T-cell depletion was achieved. Using luciferase-expressing mice, we observed recommenced imaging signals indicative of de novo MCMV IE promoter activity in depleted animals. Surprisingly, using an explant assay, we efficiently recovered reactivatable, infectious virus from untreated, latent animals, but not from those depleted of bTRMs (viral recovery in explants was reduced from 100% to 50% by day 21). We identified Lgals3 (galectin 3), Gpnmb (glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B) and Hmox1 (heme oxygenase 1) as genes that were most upregulated in bTRM-depleted groups. When bTRMs were depleted, there was transient expression of viral IE genes which resulted in antiviral microglia with a phagocytic, disease-associated (DAM) or neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype. These data provide new insights into the role of bTRMs in controlling both CNS reactivation and driving microglial phenotypes.">

        <tr id="The viral hemorrhagic fevers Ebola and Lassa fever are endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa. Both viruses are characterized by high case fatality risk and lifelong debilitating sequelae including blindness and deafness. However, despite these findings the mechanisms of disease and pathogenesis through which these viruses act remain poorly understood. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize known data regarding both acute and chronic immune-inflammatory dysfunction. A comprehensive search strategy was conducted from July 2022- August 2024. A total of 1,587 articles were identified and evaluated for inclusion. In total 49 Ebola specific and 31 Lassa fever articles were included in this review. The results of this study found considerable dysregulation in immune-inflammatory homeostasis. Specifically, Ebola was found to induce increased concentrations of molecules associated with immune cell recruitment and migration during acute disease. In addition, the virus led to reduction in innate cell populations and expansion of T-cell population frequencies across disease outcomes. Studies of Lassa fever also demonstrated considerable immune dysregulation. However, given the relative lack of studies the exact mechanism of disease is unclear. Among disease survivors, both viruses demonstrate persistent chronic immune dysregulation years following disease onset. However, associating these findings with post-viral syndromes is controversial.">

        <tr id="A series of hyper immune responses as combined reaction of innate and adaptive immunity may lead to cytokine storm prolonging sickness and causing severities among patients of respiratory infection in general and attack COVID-19 patients in particular. We measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines viz. TNF-alpha, Interleukin-6 and Interferon-gamma. The initiation of immune system against viral infection involves role of cytokines. In Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, high levels of cytokine were observed which led to severity in immune-compromised patients, elderly and even mildly infected patients. High levels of cytokines have not only been observed in SARS-CoV-2 but are also prevalent in other human coronavirus infections. There are other respiratory diseases occurring in the form of epidemics and outbreaks in all parts of the world, yet understanding of the fact that when system gets infected by more than one respiratory virus, the cytokine expression observed has not been looked upon.

This is irrespective of the fact that antibodies may already be present against respiratory diseases within the system over the course of time. We hereby hypothesise that if cytokine storm due to such condition may lead to activation of Th1/Th2 response, develop severity/complications and ultimately may lead to lung damage. In this study, we measured the cytokine response profiles (TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 and IFN-gamma) in patients with respiratory viral infections and we observed that TNF-α is the main factor contributing to cytokine storm and that hyper innate immune response is brought by mucosal immunity during infection by SARS-CoV-2.">

This study developed a tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) model to examine EV-A71 neurotropism and the disruption of the BBB. Methods A cohort of twenty-two tree shrews, aged three months, were inoculated intranasally and orally with EV-A71 to establish an in vivo infection model. Complementary in vitro experiments were conducted using primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) and astrocytes (AS) isolated from tree shrews. Results Tree shrews infected with EV-A71 demonstrated symptoms of fever, vesicular lesions, and sustained viremia. Viral replication was observed in neural tissues, including the brain and spinal cord, as well as in select non-neural organs, accompanied by histopathological changes. Evans blue permeation assessment showed increased BBB permeability. EV-A71 infection down-regulated tight junction proteins Claudin-5 and junctional adhesion molecule A in the brain. In vitro studies showed that EV-A71 replicated efficiently in MVECs and AS, inducing cytopathic effects. Scavenger Receptor Class B Member 2 (SCARB2) and Annexin A2 (ANXA2) were identified as potential functional receptors facilitating viral entry. EV-A71 infection led to the dysregulation of tight junction proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, and Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a. EV-A71 also stimulated the immune activity of AS. Discussion This study indicated that SCARB2 and ANXA2 play a role in the invasion of EV-A71 into the CNS of tree shrews. EV-A71 infection down-regulated tight junction proteins and increased the BBB permeability. This model provides a novel platform for studying EV-A71 neuropathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Although COVID-19 was originally considered a respiratory illness, it is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have far-reaching impacts on the nervous system. Neurological symptoms such as chemosensory dysfunction are frequently observed during acute infection and approximately 10% of COVID-19 cases will go on to develop new or persistent long-term symptoms, a condition known in the literature as post-acute symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC) or by the patient-coined term Long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The emergence of Long COVID has prompted renewed interest in the study of post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), particularly in the area of neuroimmune interactions. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the current body of literature on neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Long COVID, with an emphasis on neuroimmune mechanisms drawn largely from autopsy studies and animal models. A more complete understanding of neuroimmune crosstalk in Long COVID will not only guide the development of therapies for this highly disabling condition but will also contribute to our general understanding of neuroimmune interactions in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Several years after the COVID‐19 pandemic, the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immunity and the potential protective role of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination through trained immunity remain a subject of investigation. This study aimed to determine the long‐term impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immune cells and the association between BCG vaccination, latent infections and COVID‐19 severity and sepsis progression. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of patients who recovered from mild/severe/critical COVID‐19 (n = 97, 3–17 months after COVID‐19) and sepsis patients (n = 64). First, we assessed the impact of COVID‐19 and its severity on immune cell frequencies and expression of functional markers. Further, we analysed plasma titres of anti‐Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies and their association with COVID‐19 severity and sepsis outcome. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID‐19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS‐CoV‐2 and LPS. Results Post‐COVID‐19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterised by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post‐critical COVID‐19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. A trend toward improved outcomes in BCG‐seropositive COVID‐19/sepsis patients was observed, although this may be confounded by age differences between groups. In contrast, the monocyte response to stimulation appeared unaffected by COVID‐19 severity. Conclusion These findings highlight the long‐term alterations of immune cells in post‐COVID‐19 patients, emphasising the substantial impact of COVID‐19 on immune function.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The emergence of genetically diverse PRRSV-2 lineages, including the NADC34-like virus, presents significant challenges to the swine industry due to their variable pathogenicity and impact on immune modulation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying virus-induced immune modulation remain poorly understood. This study investigated the immunopathological characteristics of the Korean NADC34-like PRRSV strain JBNU-22-N01 in comparison with the NADC30-like strain PJ73 and the prototype strain VR2332 in a weaned piglet model. All PRRSV-2 strains exhibited moderate pathogenicity without mortality, following a similar infection course characterized by interstitial pneumonia, cytokine cascades (e.g., IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-12p40, IL-10, CCL2, CCL5, CCL8, and CXCL10), and upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes [e.g., ISG12(A)]. Flow cytometry analysis revealed significant alterations in the composition of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell populations, including a decreased frequency of alveolar macrophages and an increased proportion of infiltrating immune cells (monocyte-derived cells, T cells, and NK cells). However, the majority of infiltrated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exhibited minimal expression of effector cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ), suggesting a phenotypically naïve-like or functionally unresponsive state. The mRNA expression levels of BAL cells revealed significant upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules (e.g., PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, and IDO1), indicating immune regulation potentially mediated through cell-to-cell communication. Notably, IDO1 expression was modestly associated with increased systemic Kyn/Trp ratios, supporting the hypothesis that the kynurenine pathway may contribute to systemic immune modulation during PRRSV infection. From a strain-specific perspective, JBNU-22-N01 displayed a faster replication rate, resulting in an accelerated and heightened infection process with stronger immune responses. It uniquely induced robust expression of immune checkpoint molecules and enhanced IDO1 protein production in bronchoalveolar lavage cells, highlighting the immunomodulatory potential of NADC34-like PRRSV. These findings offer insights into both general and strain-specific immunopathogenesis of PRRSV-2 and support the development of better treatments. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major pathogen affecting the swine industry; however, its immune-related mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed how three genetically distinct PRRSV strains, including the globally prevalent NADC34-like strain, interact with the immune system in piglets. Our results showed that PRRSV induces severe lung inflammation accompanied by immune cell infiltration. However, many infiltrating immune cells remained inactive, likely due to increased expression of immune-suppressive molecules. Among these, the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) was notably upregulated, activating a metabolic pathway linked to immune regulation and suppression. The NADC34-like strain displayed a faster replication rate, leading to more rapid immune responses and stronger suppression compared with the other strains. These findings provide new insights into how PRRSV manipulates the immune system and suggest potential targets for improved prevention and treatment strategies.

        <tr id="In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Polytrauma with significant bone and volumetric muscle loss presents substantial clinical challenges. Although immune responses significantly influence fracture healing post-polytrauma, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation require further investigation. While previous studies examined either injury site tissue or systemic tissue (peripheral blood), our study uniquely investigated both systemic and local immune cells at the same time to better understand polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation and associated impaired bone healing. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in a rat polytrauma model, we analyzed blood, bone marrow, and the local defect soft tissue to identify potential cellular and molecular targets involved in immune dysregulation. We identified a trauma-associated immunosuppressive myeloid (TIM) cell population that drives systemic immune dysregulation, immunosuppression, and potentially impaired bone healing. We found CD1d as a global marker for TIM cells in polytrauma. In the local defect tissue, we observed Spp1+ monocytes/macrophages mediating inflammatory, fibrotic, and impaired adaptive immune responses. Finally, our findings highlighted increased signaling via Anxa1-Fpr2 and Spp1-Cd44 axes. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of immune dysregulation-mediated nonunion following traumatic injury and provides biomarkers that could function as treatment targets.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes play pivotal roles in maintaining neural architecture and function. However, their pronounced heterogeneity, especially in reactive states where distinct subtypes can adopt potentially opposing functions (e.g., neuroprotective vs. neuroinflammatory), complicates our understanding of their net contributions to neurological disorders. A critical challenge arises because these functionally distinct subpopulations often coexist, and the lack of precise tools to separately monitor or manipulate them has significantly hindered efforts to dissect their specific roles in disease progression. Here, we address this gap by developing and optimizing fluorescent RNA sensors mediated by endogenous adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) for application in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes. We employed a streamlined screening methodology to enhance sensor specificity and functionality for complement component 3 (C3), a key marker predominantly associated with neuroinflammatory astrocytes, thus enabling subtype-specific tracking and providing a crucial tool for distinguishing these cells within heterogeneous populations. By integrating the biological complexity of astrocytes with the technological precision of ADAR-mediated sensing, this study establishes a robust framework for investigating astrocyte dynamics.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lipid metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of acute viral infections by affecting viral replication and the host immune response. In contrast, the role of host lipid metabolism during chronic viral infection has been less explored. The current study aims to define the role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a primary physiologic receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), during natural gammaherpesvirus infection. Gammaherpesviruses are highly prevalent cancer-associated pathogens that induce and manipulate germinal center responses to establish life-long infection of B cells. Importantly, gammaherpesvirus-infected germinal center B cells are thought to be the target of viral transformation. In this study, we found that global SR-BI deficiency led to increased gammaherpesvirus lytic gene expression in the lungs during the acute stage of infection. Chronic gammaherpesvirus infection of the SR-BI-deficient host was associated with exaggerated germinal center responses and increased differentiation of self-reactive B cells that persisted during the long-term stage of chronic infection. Interestingly, SR-BI-deficient germinal center B cells, although more numerous, failed to support efficient gammaherpesvirus infection. The exaggerated germinal center response was also observed following immunization of the SR-BI-deficient host, unveiling the novel role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of physiological and gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center responses. IMPORTANCE Lipid metabolism affects diverse acute viral infections. In contrast, less is known about the effect of lipid metabolism on chronic virus infection, including in the context of an intact host. Host lipid homeostasis is maintained via a combination of endogenous lipid synthesis that takes place in most cell types and cellular interaction with exogenous, circulating lipids. This study focuses on defining the interaction between SR-BI, a primary HDL receptor, and natural gammaherpesvirus infection. We found that SR-BI deficiency led to increased expression of lytic gammaherpesvirus genes during acute gammaherpesvirus replication in the lungs. Importantly, chronic gammaherpesvirus infection unveiled the physiological role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of the germinal center response, a B cell differentiation process that is critical for physiological B cell responses and that is manipulated by gammaherpesviruses to establish chronic infection.

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) strains mutate rapidly, making it crucial to study their molecular mechanisms for swift vaccine and drug development. Here, we utilized host lung proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling to investigate the underlying pathology caused by the variants. Lung tissues infected with wild‐type GD108, Delta, or Omicron BA.1 variants showed overexpression of proteins and phosphoproteins linked to the innate immune pathway, particularly in the Omicron group, with high activation of NOD‐receptor and RIG‐I like receptor signaling pathways. Protein‐protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed six key proteins, including antiviral innate immune response receptor RIG‐I (DDX58), and five interferon‐related proteins (IFIT2, ISG15, MX1, STAT1, and EIF2AK2), highlighting the importance of the innate immune response in combating all three variants. Kinase prediction analysis suggested that six kinases (DAPK1, DAPK2, DAPK3, PRACK, TTK, and MAP2K2), potentially inhibited by Fostamatinib, were activated across all three variants, and might be potential drug targets, pending further verification. Omicron infection, compared to other mutants, significantly disrupted proteins related to pulmonary structural support, like integrin and collagens, and inhibited efferocytosis, reducing the host's ability to eliminate the pathogen. These findings suggest that innate immune activation and structural disruption may contribute to Omicron‐related pathology, potentially being useful for research into the molecular mechanisms underlying lung injury from SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.">

        <tr id="Multiple lines of evidence suggest that endothelial dysfunction is a key player in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with cytokine storm as one of the main primary causes. Among the mechanisms underlying endothelial damage, clinical findings identify alterations in arginine metabolism, as patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit lower levels of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and upregulated arginase. In this study, we investigated, in human endothelial cells (HUVECs), the effect of conditioned medium from macrophages activated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (CM_S1) on arginine metabolism. The results indicate that CM_S1 causes a marked decrease in eNOS and an increase in arginase, along with a greater intracellular arginine content and the induction of the CAT2 transporter. These effects are ascribable to the inflammatory mediators released by macrophages in CM_S1, mainly TNFα and IL-1β. Since infliximab, an antibody targeting TNFα, and baricitinib, an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway, correct the observed imbalance between eNOS and arginase, our findings suggest the potential efficacy of a combined therapy to counteract endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its impact on public health continue to demand attention as the virus continues to evolve, demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt to diverse selective pressures including immune responses, therapeutic treatments, and prophylactic interventions. The SARS-CoV-2 variant landscape remains dynamic, with new subvariants continuously emerging, many harboring spike protein mutations linked to immune evasion. In this study, we characterized a panel of live SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those key subvariants implicated in recent waves of infection. Our findings revealed a significant variability in mutation patterns in the spike protein across the strains analyzed. Commercial antibodies and human convalescent plasma (HCoP) samples from unvaccinated donors were ineffective in neutralizing the most recent Omicron subvariants, particularly after the emergence of JN.1 subvariant. Using human airway epithelial cells derived from healthy bronchiolar tissue (hBAEC), we established both monoinfections and coinfections involving SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus H1N1 (IFAV_H1N1) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Assessments were conducted to compare viral infectivity and the production and release of immune mediators in the apical and basolateral compartments. Notably, Omicron KP.3.1.1 subvariant induced a more pronounced cytopathic effect in hBAEC compared to its parental strain JN.1 and even surpassed the impact observed with the ancestral wild-type virus (WA1/2020, Washington strain). Furthermore, the coinfection of KP.3.1.1 subvariant with IFAV_H1N1 or RSV did not attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity; instead, it significantly exacerbated the pathogenic synergy in the lung epithelium. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-β, and IL-10 were upregulated in hBAEC following SARS-CoV-2 monoinfection with recent Omicron subvariants as well as during coinfection with IFAV_H1N1 and RSV. Taken together, our findings offer new insights into the immune evasion strategies and pathogenic potential of evolving SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, as well as their interactions with other respiratory viruses, carrying important implications for therapeutic development and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="A liver involvement in Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) has been frequently observed in patients hospitalised for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection during 2020; in such cases, the clinical and prognostic relevance of hepatocellular damage has been widely acknowledged. On the other hand, there is less extensive evidence of liver injury (LI) in the subsequent waves of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of LI and to determine the clinical, biochemical, and immune‐virologic characteristics associated with its development in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients hospitalised in 2021–2022. This single‐centre retrospective study included 455 patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and respiratory failure. LI was defined by the detection of transaminase levels exceeding three times the upper limit of normality (ULN) and was further classified as early or late liver injury based on whether the peak transaminase value occurred within or after 7 days from hospital admission. LI was found in 17.6% (80/455) of the overall cohort, while early liver injury (ELI) and late liver injury (LLI) were detected in 10.4% and 11.5%, respectively. LI was associated with younger age, elevated inflammatory and tissue damage markers, with the presence of chronic liver disease (CLD), and with the use of interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) inhibitors. Patients with LI had a higher probability of severe COVID‐19, transfer to intensive care unit, and in‐hospital death than those without. In multivariable analysis, younger age, administration of IL‐6 inhibitors, and the presence of higher gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were independently related to the development of overall LI, whereas in‐hospital mortality was independently correlated with the occurrence of LLI. The occurrence of hepatocellular damage therefore has been associated with a pro‐inflammatory profile and with worse overall outcomes but not with increased likelihood of liver failure or liver‐related mortality.">

Poly(A) polymerase gamma (PAPOLG) was previously shown to be upregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study explored how PAPOLG affects the inflammatory reaction triggered by SARS-CoV-2. PAPOLG was knocked down or overexpressed in THP-1 macrophages. Target pathways were identified using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The levels of PAPOLG, transcriptional regulator nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were measured, along with an assessment of NF-κB mRNA stability. PAPOLG was significantly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected THP-1 macrophages. Genes subjected to alternative polyadenylation were enriched in immune pathways, and NF-κB emerged as a key regulator. Knockdown of PAPOLG promoted NF-κB mRNA degradation, while decreasing the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL6). Conversely, overexpression of PAPOLG stabilized NF-κB mRNA and enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 expression. PAPOLG contributes to the inflammatory response in SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages by stabilizing NF-κB mRNA. Thus, PAPOLG may be targeted to control COVID-19-related inflammation.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) infection is known to cause hand-foot-mouth disease, which may develop severe symptoms such as encephalitis, herpangina, and paralysis, leading to pulmonary edema and even death in children under five years old. Existing animal models for EV-A71 pathogenesis have limitations, necessitating novel models to study human-relevant disease mechanisms. Using glycoproteomic profiling to identify EV-A71-interacting proteins, we previously discovered human nucleolin (hNCL) as an attachment molecule that enhances viral binding and infection in vitro. Here, we developed human nucleolin transgenic (hNCL-Tg) mice to investigate EV-A71 pathogenesis in vivo. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, EV-A71-infected hNCL-Tg mice exhibited higher clinical scores, progressive limb paralysis, and increased mortality. Six days post-infection, hNCL-Tg mice showed elevated viral loads in the spinal cord and skeletal muscle, with pronounced EV-A71 VP1 expression in these tissues and the brainstem. Histopathology revealed severe skeletal muscle damage and significant pulmonary edema, characterized by lung congestion, hemorrhage, and erythrocyte infiltration into alveoli. Infected hNCL-Tg mice also displayed elevated levels of encephalitis- and pulmonary edema-associated proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-13). These findings establish the hNCL-Tg mouse as a robust model for studying EV-A71 pathogenesis and evaluating preclinical therapeutics.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global health crisis, with many patients experiencing not only acute neurological and sensory symptoms but also persistent sensory abnormalities, commonly referred to as long COVID sequelae. The mechanisms underlying somatosensory abnormalities induced by SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein in pain regulation. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 N protein exacerbates pathological pain in mouse models of bone cancer, chemotherapy, neuropathic, and inflammatory, and promotes the chronification of acute inflammatory pain. We also identify a potential interaction between the N protein and Nav1.7 in dorsal root ganglion neurons from mice, monkeys, and humans. Furthermore, the N protein significantly increases Nav1.7 currents in dorsal root ganglion neurons from both mice and monkeys by delaying Nav1.7 inactivation without altering its expression or membrane trafficking. This modulation of Nav1.7 function by the N protein not only intensifies pain hypersensitivity but also prolongs the duration of pain, potentially facilitating the transition from acute to chronic pain. Our findings underscore the importance of vigilant management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with pathological pain and suggest potential therapeutic targets for mitigating COVID-19-related pain.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cerebral cytokinopathies are key examples of dysregulated cytokine responses. While mouse models with targeted production of individual cytokines have been pivotal in establishing a causal link between cytokines and disease— especially in the central nervous system—they often fail to replicate the complex inflammatory environments seen in various neuropathological conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, where multiple cytokines are upregulated. Methods To address this, we developed a novel mouse model, GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice, by combining transgenic mice with astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 (GFAP-IL6 mice) and IFN-α (GFAP-IFNlo mice). Results Our findings reveal that chronic, low-level production of IFN-α, below the typical disease-inducing threshold, significantly accelerates disease progression in GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice compared to GFAP-IL6 mice. The double transgenic mice exhibited progressive ataxia, persistent seizure-like episodes, and reduced survival. Remarkably, the clinical and pathological symptoms remained predominantly IL-6-driven and required the presence of adaptive immune cells.

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory route. Following intranasal instillation, VSV moves along the axons of olfactory sensory neurons to the olfactory bulb. While within the olfactory bulb the spread of the virus is controlled by microglia activation and the recruitment of peripheral leukocytes, some of the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we used mice with conditional deletions of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an adaptor for RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling. By selectively deleting MAVS in neurons, astrocytes, or long-lived myeloid cells, we discovered that RLR signaling specifically within brain-resident myeloid cells is crucial for protection against the virus. Infected mice with a MAVS deletion in these myeloid cells showed normal myeloid cell and leukocyte infiltration into the brain. However, the P2RY12+ microglia showed aberrant expression of genes involved in antigen cross-presentation. Furthermore, flow cytometry experiments revealed diminished MHC class I expression on MAVS deficient microglia. Moreover, CNS infiltrating CD8+ T cells had dysfunctional transcriptional profiles. Therefore, our findings indicate that during viral CNS infection, MAVS signaling in brain-resident myeloid cells, presumably microglia, is essential for antigen cross-presentation and the relicensing of protective, infiltrating CD8+ T cells.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and associated with systemic inflammation. Inflammation is an important process that follows infection and facilitates the body's innate immune response and repair of damaged tissue. Polyunsaturated fatty acids play an important role in the inflammatory process. These lipids can target transcription factors to modulate gene expression and protein function. Methods Here, we performed a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and immunoassays to evaluate whether differences in basal levels of different types of biomarkers can be detected in freshly frozen plasma samples from patients with and without COVID‐19. Results FAME analysis showed a decrease in arachidic acid and myristic acid, but an increase in caprylic acid, palmitic acid, and eicosenoic acid in the plasma of COVID‐19 patients compared to non‐COVID‐19 patients. Multiple chemokines including IP‐10, MCP‐1, and MIP‐1 beta were increased in the COVID‐19 group compared to the non‐COVID‐19 group. Similarly, cytokines including IL‐1 alpha and IL‐8, and cell adhesion and inflammatory response markers including ICAM‐1 and E‐selectin were greater in the plasma of COVID‐19 patients compared to non‐COVID‐19 patients. Conclusions A baseline signature of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids, cytokines, and chemokines present in the plasma after COVID‐19 viral infection may serve as biomarkers that can be useful in various applications including determination of severity of infection, indication of disease prognosis, and consideration for therapeutic options.">

        <tr id="Background A number of studies have shown that methylomes of blood cells of COVID-19 patients display infection-related methylation changes. Those methylation abnormalities were associated with clinical outcomes of the infection and, thus, can potentially be utilized as biomarkers in clinical COVID-19 management. However, a number of parameters need to be assessed, before a clinical use of a biomarker candidate is proposed, with the most important one being reproducible detection in independent target populations. Methods We benchmarked data reported in publications investigating genome-wide methylation changes occurring in blood cells during SARS-CoV-2 virus infection to assess potential applicability of these changes as biomarkers in clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Results We identified nine studies, in which infection-related genome-wide methylation changes in blood cells of COVID-19 patients were reported and associations of those changes with outcomes of the infection was assessed. Our benchmarking analysis showed that each of those studies included patients with different clinical characteristics and each study utilized different symptoms assessment criteria. Most importantly, no uniform data analysis methodologies to identify virus-related methylation changes were used in the analyzed studies. Consequently, analyzed studies, except for one, which was based on uniform data analysis workflow applied across independent patient cohorts, reported sufficiently uniform results that would allow to propose the use of the identified infection-related methylation changes as biomarkers for clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions Due to lack of coherence between studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 associated methylation changes in blood, the potential use of already reported methylation changes as biomarkers for clinical management of COVID-19 patients needs to be further assessed in rigorously controlled studies. At the same time unified data analysis framework appears to be the most critical in development of biomarkers associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and Monkeypox (Mpox) are viral infections that have similar modes of presentation, diagnosis and treatment strategies. Understanding their co-infection dynamics and immune response is important for public health policies. Aim This article aims to determine the relationship between dynamicity and immune response interactions between Mpox and COVID-19, focusing more on the implications for disease severity, viral transmission, and vaccine efficacy. Methodology An extensive literature review was conducted through electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science from the last decade (2014–2024) using keywords: COVID-19, Co-infections, Immune response, Monkeypox, and Vaccination. Results Several co-infections between COVID-19 and Mpox have been reported, especially a case from Florida, in the United States of America (USA), in Barcelona, Spain (a 56-year-old man who suffered both Mpox and COVID-19 and syphilis simultaneously, and from Italy (a 36-year-old male). Both COVID-19 and Mpox have been shown to have some effects on the immunity of a person, especially the innate system, which can occasionally produce inadvertent effects. A common factor that links the two diseases is the endoglycosidase named Heparanase (HPSE). Both COVID-19 and Mpox clinical features have bizarre severity and complications. The rising co-infection of COVID-19 and increased Mpox infection rate has led to the development of only approved vaccines JYNNEOS and COH04S1. Conclusion Global efforts such as adequate awareness campaigns through webinars, social media platforms, and research, including experimental studies, cohort studies, case series, etc., should be put in place to give more insights into both diseases. Such efforts should be backed up with good political will, adequate funding, the establishment of research facilities and interprofessional measures among the concerned countries and policymakers in the world.">

        <tr id="Introduction As of mid-2024, COVID-19 has affected over 676 million people worldwide, leading to more than 6.8 million deaths. Numerous studies have documented metabolic changes occurring during both the acute phase of the disease and the recovery phase, which, in some cases, contribute to the development of long COVID syndrome. Aims and methods In this study, we aimed to evaluate clinical, laboratory, and comprehensive metabolomic data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the second, third and fourth waves (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron). A targeted, fully quantitative metabolomics assay (TMIC MEGA Assay) was used to measure 529 metabolites and lipids in plasma samples. The metabolomic profiles of these patients were compared according to different and relevant factors impacting COVID-19 outcome, such as age, sex, comorbidities, and vaccination status. Results Among the 21 classes of compounds evaluated in this study, amino acids and lipids were the most dysregulated when comparing age, sex, comorbidities, vaccination status, and the different epidemiological waves. This is the most comprehensive analysis in Mexico providing absolute quantitative data for 529 metabolites and lipids measured in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which could be used to monitor their metabolic status and clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection or with long COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="Immune cell activation is a feature of COVID-19, that leads to cytokine storm which causes neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, related to psychiatric symptoms due to the depletion of neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate which play a major role in adult neurogenesis. ACE2 receptors are expressed in the hippocampus and decreased neurogenesis in this region is a major factor behind the neuropsychiatric disorders. SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain indirectly through neuroinflammation and altered neurochemical signaling and even mild COVID-19 infections can lead to sustained microglial activation, which disrupts neural networks and impairs cognitive function. The long COVID-19 may be associated with cognitive dysfunction in those who recovered and immunological response may affect synaptic pruning and reduced anterior cingulate cortex volume at one year after COVID-19. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or PASC, commonly known as Long COVID is a significant public health concern and "brain fog" is one of the most debilitating cognitive impairments, affecting memory, concentration, and executive function occurring in 88% of cases. Brain fog may be linked to persistent changes in neurotransmitter levels, particularly involving dopamine and serotonin which play an essential role in cognition, attention, and emotional regulation. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the chemokine CCL11, is linked to cognitive impairments in patients with persistent symptoms. Neuroprotective agents that support neuronal health, such as antioxidants and mitochondrial enhancers and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic and direct current enhance cortical excitability are investigated in cognitive recovery. Evaluation of the currently predominant VUM (a Variant Under Monitoring), LP.8.1, and the most recently designated NB.1.8.1, is increasing as 10.7% of global sequences reported recently due to minor mutations in spike protein. In May 2025, TAG-CO-VAC (Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine) advised that the monovalent vaccines targeting against JN.1 or KP.2 lineages are highly appropriate.">

This response is essential to limit virus replication and spread. However, an exacerbated response may cause severe immune-pathologies. Therefore, it is very important to better understand innate immune responses at the level of its molecular networks in the context of viral infections. Data We infected human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and human monocytic (THP-1) cells with H3N2 influenza virus A virus and performed transcriptome analysis using next generation RNA sequencing at various times post infection. We report raw sequence data and normalized log2 transformed gene expression values. This data will allow researchers in the field to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways between the two cell types and over times post infection. Furthermore, our data enables comparisons to molecular studies performed in humans and animal models in the context of respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="The interplay between comorbidities and viral infections is a critical factor that influences disease severity and outcomes. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one such comorbidity that significantly elevates the risk of severe viral infection from coronaviruses, namely, SARS-CoV-2. DM is characterized by either a lack of insulin production (type 1 diabetes) or insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes), both of which contribute to a state of hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia significantly promotes chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, which put diabetics at an elevated risk of critical health outcomes. Additionally, diabetes is hypothesized to amplify viral titers during infection by promoting the expression of the viral entry receptor ACE2 and providing a favorable cellular energy environment for viral replication. This review focuses on explaining the mechanisms that link diabetics with more severe COVID-19 disease and exploring some of the mechanisms that contribute to the phenomenon where COVID-19 can promote new-onset diabetes.

The mechanisms by which aging negatively impacts the innate and adaptive immune system, leading to enhanced susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens, remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we utilized a mouse model of infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a virus that can infect the lungs and lead to pneumonia, a rare but serious health concern in the elderly. Following intranasal inoculation of young (6 weeks), adult (36 weeks), and aged mice (68 weeks) with HSV-1 (KOS strain) we: (i) compared the local and systemic immune responses to infection in young, adult, and aged mice, and (ii) correlated the level and type of immune responses to protection against HSV-1 infection and disease. Compared to young and adult mice, aged mice displayed: (i) increased activation of epithelial cells with a decreased expression of TLR3; (ii) increased activation of dendritic cells with increased expression of MHC-I, MHC-II, and CD80/86; (iii) decreased production of type-I interferons; (iv) delayed production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs; and (v) impairment frequencies of functional HSV-specific CD107+IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells associated with the increased incidence of viral infection and disease.

        <tr id="SUMMARY The mechanisms by which viruses enter host cells are crucial for their ability to infect and cause disease, serving as major targets for both host immune responses and therapeutic strategies. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry process is primarily driven by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, in conjunction with the activity of endosomal cathepsin L and the serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, recent scientific advances have expanded our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, uncovering alternative receptors and novel cofactors that may enhance viral tropism and adaptability. Given the critical role of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in mediating host cell entry, it has become a primary target for prevention and therapeutic strategies. However, the continuous spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of S protein variants that may potentially confer a fitness advantage or modify key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology, such as transmissibility, infectivity, antigenicity, and/or pathogenicity, posing significant challenges to the efficacy of current interventions. In this review, we provide an updated and comprehensive overview of the latest advances in SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways and molecular mechanisms, exploring their implications for antiviral drug discovery, vaccine design, and the development of other biomedical strategies while addressing the challenges posed by the ongoing evolution of the virus.">

        <tr id="African swine fever (ASF) is a highly fatal viral disease in pigs, with mortality rates that can reach 100%. The causative agent, African swine fever virus (ASFV), primarily targets cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), particularly monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Despite the severity of the disease, there are currently no effective antiviral treatments available in Europe. A significant barrier to therapeutic development is the limited understanding of how ASFV interacts with its primary target cells. A deeper understanding of the morphological changes induced by ASFV in infected cells is crucial to this effort. To address this knowledge gap, we used conventional and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, as well as transmission electron microscopy, to investigate ASFV-infected primary MDMs. Our analysis revealed that ASFV infection leads to the formation of large cellular protrusions, which are characterized by vesicle-shaped cellular segments (CSs) at their tips. These protrusions contain all major cytoskeletal components, showing characteristics similar to those of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). In 84.93% of the cases, the nucleus remained in the cell body (CB) near the viral factory. In the remaining cases, the nucleus was found within these CSs, whereas the viral factory was present in the CB. Additionally, 57.6% of the cells were in contact with the CS and distant cells, suggesting a potential mechanism for ASFV transmission. These findings suggest that ASFV induces cellular segmentation linked by TNT-like structures. Further research is needed to better understand the biogenesis and functional significance of these segmented cells, which could inform future strategies for combating ASFV.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia damages alveolar type II cells and disrupts surfactant homeostasis, contributing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D) are critical for reducing alveolar surface tension and for innate immune defense. We aimed to evaluate whether surfactant protein gene expression varies with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 122 adults with confirmed COVID-19, categorized as asymptomatic (no symptoms), mild (requiring hospitalization), or severe (requiring ICU admission). We quantified mRNA expression of surfactant protein genes (SFTPA1, SFTPA2, SFTPB, SFTPC, SFTPD) in blood cells using RT-qPCR. Relative expression was normalized to GAPDH and compared among the groups using the 2−ΔΔCt method. Outliers (Ct values > 3 SD from the mean) were excluded before analysis. Results: Distinct surfactant gene expression patterns were markedly associated with disease severity. Transcripts of SFTPB and SFTPC decreased with increasing severity of the disease. Notably, SFTPC expression was ~49-fold higher in mild cases compared to asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients (p < 0.0001), but then decreased by ~54-fold in severe cases relative to mild (p < 0.0001), returning to near-baseline levels. In contrast, SFTPA2 and SFTPD were dramatically upregulated in severe cases. SFTPA2 was ~50-fold higher in severe versus mild cases (p < 0.0001), and SFTPD was ~4346-fold higher in severe versus asymptomatic cases (p < 0.0001; ~9.6-fold higher than in mild). SFTPA1 showed only a modest ~1.4-fold decrease in severe cases (vs. mild). All noted differences remained statistically significant after outlier exclusion. Conclusions: COVID-19 severity is correlated with profound changes in surfactant gene expression in blood. Critically ill patients exhibit loss of key surfactant components (SP-B and SP-C transcripts) alongside an excessive SP-D response. These preliminary findings suggest an imbalance that may contribute to lung injury in severe disease. However, further validation is needed to establish surfactant proteins, such as SP-D, as biomarkers of COVID-19 severity.">

        <tr id="Background COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has been globally reported to be a life-threatening complication of severe COVID-19. Previous studies primarily focused on an association between secondary Aspergillus infection and elevated mortality risk in COVID-19 patients, while potential confounding factors and alternative pathogenic mechanisms remain insufficiently investigated. The risk factors and outcomes of patients with secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection following invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) were not been well explored either. Methods This retrospective monocentric study enrolled 152 hospitalized IPA patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 November 2022 to 31 October 2023. The characteristics of IPA patients and related risk factors were investigated, and the relationship between different SARS-CoV-2 infection status and the prognosis in IPA patients was further evaluated. Results Our analysis demonstrated that IPA patients subsequently diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited significantly elevated mortality risk compared to those without viral coinfection (53.6% vs. 22.9%, P < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 infection status (OR 3.708; P = 0.001; 95%CI 1.674–8.212), albumin concentration (OR 0.885; P = 0.005; 95%CI 0.813–0.964), and C-reactive protein level (OR 1.007; P = 0.012; 95%CI 1.002–1.013) were statistically significant independent risk factors for prognosis of IPA patients. Subsequent analysis established a multivariate risk prediction model incorporating independent prognostic factors, which exhibited robust discriminative capacity for mortality risk stratification via ROC curve validation (AUC = 0.792, 95%CI 0.721–0.862, P < 0.0001). A statistically significant difference in mortality rate existed between IPA patients with secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and CAPA patients (63.2% and 33.3%, P = 0.037). Notably, comparative analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in 28-day (22/96, 22.9% vs. 6/18, 33.3%) or 90-day mortality rates (22/96, 22.9% vs. 6/18, 33.3%) between patients with IPA without SARS-CoV-2 infection and IPA patients with secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions IPA patients with secondary SARS-CoV-2 coinfection had a lower mortality compared to those with CAPA. Considering the high mortality rate, more medical cares are needed for these patients.

        <tr id="Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most dangerous viral diseases, with innate immunity representing the first line of defense against the virus. In this branch of the immune system, neutrophils are considered key cellular mediators. To better understand the implication of neutrophils in the distinct stages of the disease, HBV-infected patients were enrolled in this study and categorized into three groups: patients with acute infection, chronic infection under treatment, and at early cirrhotic stage. To elucidate the role of inflammatory mediators and cellular mechanisms of neutrophilic origin in the course of the infection, both ex vivo and in vitro studies were performed. Increased levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin (IL)-18, IL-33, and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3)—an accurate marker of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)—were detected in the circulation of patients with acute infection or early cirrhosis. In parallel, sera from the aforementioned patient groups induced the formation of IL-1b-bearing NETs in neutrophils from healthy individuals. These inflammatory NETs affected primary fibroblasts towards acquiring a pro-fibrotic phenotype. These results suggest that NETs could be regarded as mediators in hepatitis B manifestations, while their therapeutic targeting could enhance the management of early-stage cirrhotic patients.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic with far-reaching impacts on human activities. Moreover, direct viral damage and uncontrolled inflammation have been proposed as contributing factors to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is also well recognized for its capability to trigger and modulate the host’s innate immune system by attaching to bacterial substances. Nevertheless, the pandemic has further emphasized the critical role of an effective host immune response in controlling viral infection and highlighted the detrimental effect of immune dysregulation. This study aimed to assess plasma levels of LBP and inflammatory biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2 patients with different malnutrition status and severity levels. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh from December 2020 to December 2021. A total of 166 SARS-CoV-2 patients were recruited including 80 critical and 86 non-critical patients. Medical history, anthropometrical parameters, disease outcome information, and relevant biochemical parameters were extracted from medical records. Plasma samples were collected to test for LBP and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, nutritional risk was assessed by the Nutrition Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002) tool. Results: This cross-sectional study found no significant differences in LBP levels between critical and non-critical SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, LBP levels significantly correlated with IL-10, TNF-α and IL-6/IL-10 levels (Spearman’s rho = 0.430, 0.276 and −0.397 respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study confirmed the elevated inflammatory cytokines in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and their association with disease severity and malnutrition. These findings may support the mechanism of gut inflammation in order to develop new interventions that lower inflammatory biomarkers, disease severity, and aid in SARS-CoV-2 prevention and management.">

Investigating the altered pathogenicity of coexisting microorganisms and their influence on disease progression provides valuable insights for the development of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against infectious processes. This article provides a comprehensive review of current literature on viral-bacterial interactions in the context of respiratory infections, their pathogenic mechanisms, and significance during the COVID-19 pandemic. It synthesizes recent findings on how SARS-CoV-2 influences mucosal immunity, facilitates secondary bacterial infections through immune modulation, and impacts disease severity and clinical outcomes in co-infected individuals. Special attention is given to the molecular and cellular pathways mediating virus-bacteria interactions, including host receptor modulation, cytokine and interferon response alterations, and disruptions to the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiota. The epidemiological trends observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including shifts in the prevalence of common respiratory pathogens and the emergence of new co-infection patterns, are also considered. Understanding the dynamic interplay between viral and bacterial pathogens is crucial for optimizing patient management, improving outcomes, and guiding effective public health interventions.">

        <tr id="Introduction 1-5% of all patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), even those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, continue to have symptoms after initial recovery. Symptoms associated with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PACS) include, among others, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and cognitive dysfunction. Since the dysregulated immune response appears to be caused by the sustained activation of certain immune cells, including monocytes, and the release of specific cytokines, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PACS disease on monocyte subpopulations. Methods Twenty-two healthy and thirty-two patients with PACS were included into this study. We performed blood gas analysis and measured hematological parameters from peripheral blood of PACS patients and compared them with healthy donors. Surface markers to identify monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results PACS patients had higher numbers of intermediate and CD56+ monocytes, whereas the numbers of total monocytes, classical and non-classical monocytes were normal compared to healthy donors. Comparison of patients with and without fatigue, cough, and dyspnea showed no difference in monocyte subset frequencies. However, patients with cognitive dysfunction had increased numbers of non-classical monocytes compared to patients without this symptom. Discussion This suggests a disturbed homeostasis of the monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with PACS.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Background Pathological inflammation with a loss of synaptic integrity and function has been implicated in HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Although therapeutics exist to increase the lifespan of people living with HIV (PLWH), they are not effective at preventing neuroinflammation and HIV induced neuronal damage persists. In this study, we investigate the ephrin-B/EphB axis, which regulates inflammation, in post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and experimental models in order to assess its potential role in HIV induced neuroinflammation. Methods We analyze mRNA samples of post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and uninfected controls obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) and, for comparison, of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Follow-up experiments employ mouse brain tissue and in vitro models, including immortalized human microglia, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mixed neuroglial cell cultures, cellular and molecular interference, functional and multiplex assays, immunofluorescence and mRNA sequencing to examine the role of the ephrin-B/EphB axis in neuroinflammation and the associated neurotoxicity. Results Using qRT-PCR we find increased expression of EphB2 in post-mortem brain of PLWH, and detect a correlation with pro-viral DNA, viral RNA and an inverse correlation with abstract executive function and verbal fluency. Increased expression of ephrin-B/EphB at mRNA and protein level is also observed in brains of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV suggesting the upregulation can be driven, at least in part, by expression of viral gp120 envelope protein and a type I interferon, IFNβ. Additionally, we find induction of ephrin-B1 expression in microglia following activation by IFNβ. Given the previously reported impact of EphB2 on inflammation in the periphery, the functional role of EphB2-mediated ephrin-B reverse signaling on microglia is assessed for a pro-inflammatory and anti-viral signature. We find that EphB2 treated microglia secrete inflammatory and anti-viral factors but also exert contact-independent neurotoxicity. Finally, knockdown of microglial ephrin-B1, an EphB2 binding partner, shows a partial alleviation of the microglial pro-inflammatory signature and neurotoxicity. Conclusion Our study suggests that elevated EphB2, and its reverse signaling through ephrin-B1 in microglia contribute to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in neuroHIV.

        <tr id="Background Monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in phagocytic reactions, which potentially play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Imbalance of these cells in peripheral blood has proven to affect not only innate but also adaptive immunity. It is possible that a search for strategies to restore monocyte activity could be a major step in achieving immune control over COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes and neutrophils, and COVID-19 severity, to assess the effects of a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent on phagocytosis parameters in in-hospital COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods The study included 105 adult patients with moderate COVID-19, who had been hospitalized in 2020–2021 and treated in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. All patients were divided into two groups: in Group 1 patients received standard treatment and Immunovac VP4 therapeutic vaccine, a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent as add-on therapy from Day 1 of hospitalization; in Group 2 patients did not receive any add-on treatment. The study parameters included C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), SpO2, lung involvement on chest computer tomography (CT) scan, and phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood leukocytes based on the absorption activity (AA) of monocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes against S. аureus). The parameters were assessed at 1, 14 and 30 days. Results Based on a cluster analysis of the clinical findings and the results of diagnostic tests obtained on admission, the patients were divided into 2 clusters: cluster 1 including patients with a more severe disease (n = 34) and cluster 2 including patients with a less severe disease (n = 71). Cluster 1 patients had higher levels of CRP (20.1 vs. 2.2 mg/mL, p < 0.001), AST (32.9 vs. 26.2 U/L, p = 0.003), lower SpO2 (94% vs. 96%, p < 0,001) and more extensive lung involvement on chest CT scan (35% vs. 12%, p < 0,001). There was a statistically significant direct correlation between blood monocyte AA and SpO2 (p = 0.04), an inverse correlation between monocyte AA and CRP (p = 0.003) and the extent of lung involvement on CT scan (p = 0.05). In less severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 2), no statistically significant correlation was observed. In more severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 1), there was a rise in monocyte AA on day 30 of hospitalization both in the control group (from 86.6 to 92.2, p = 0.03) and the main group, who received Immunovac VP4 add-on therapy (from 87.3 to 98.3, p = 0.05). However, the patients who received the immunostimulating agent, had higher monocyte PI than the controls, without the immunostimulant (p = 0.05). Patients from cluster 1 who were given Immunovac VP4 had higher SpO2 levels (98% vs. 97%, p = 0.01) than those who had received only the standard treatment. Discussion Blood monocyte AA correlates with COVID-19 severity: patients with less severe disease have higher AA and those with more severe illness have lower AA. The standard treatment, combined with Immunovac VP4 enhances phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes, which is associated with a more marked increase in SpO2, especially in more severe patients.">

        <tr id="During the early stages of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, concerns arose regarding the susceptibility of asthmatic children, one of the most common chronic conditions in childhood and a major cause of hospitalization in pediatric settings. Unexpectedly, evidences showed milder clinical courses and fewer asthma exacerbations in these patients, even if cases of critical and fatal infection, often related to specific clinical features of the patient, are not negligible. In this regard, obesity is considered not only an important comorbidity in patients with difficult-to-treat asthma but also a risk factor for more severe forms of COVID-19. These observations are of even greater concern in the context of an increase in childhood obesity that began even before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and has continued also as a consequence of it. Given asthma’s heterogeneity, especially in children, an endotype-based approach is crucial. This is possible through a detailed analysis of the complex metabolic pathways that correlate asthma, COVID-19 infection and obesity thanks to new high-through-put technologies, especially metabolomics, which with minimally invasive sampling, including on exhaled breath condensate (EBC), can provide precise and unbiased evidence in support of existing endotypes, making it possible to identify not only the most vulnerable individuals and thus risk stratification through specific biomarkers, but also new molecular and therapeutic targets. This review explores asthma endotypes by highlighting their shared immunometabolic pathways with COVID-19. Findings suggest that metabolomics could enable more accurate risk stratification and guide personalized interventions during viral pandemics, especially in the presence of relevant comorbidities such as obesity.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: COVID-19 has been associated with a wide range of immune responses, including the production of autoantibodies, particularly in severe cases. This study investigates the IgG autoantibody responses in patients with varying severities of COVID-19 infection and compares these responses with vaccinated individuals. Methods: We utilized proteomic profiling to analyze autoantibody reactivity against a broad spectrum of proteins expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets in serum samples from severe and moderate COVID-19 patients, as well as vaccinated individuals who received the inactivated CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccine. Results: Our findings indicate a marked increase in the diversity and number of IgG autoantibodies targeting intracellular and membrane-associated proteins in severe COVID-19 cases, compared to those with moderate cases of the disease. The autoantibody response in severe cases was found to primarily target proteins involved in immune cell activation, signaling, and differentiation, suggesting potential pathways of immune dysregulation and autoimmunity. In contrast, vaccinated individuals did not exhibit similar autoantibody reactivity, pointing to a more controlled immune response post-vaccination. Notably, no significant autoimmune responses were detected in the vaccinated cohort, suggesting that the inactivated vaccine does not induce autoreactive IgG. These findings align with the established safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines, especially in comparison to the heightened immune dysregulation observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The absence of a significant autoantibody response in vaccinated individuals supports the notion that vaccines, while inducing robust immune activation, do not typically trigger autoimmunity in healthy individuals. Conclusions: Our study underscores the importance of distinguishing between the immune responses triggered by infection and vaccination and highlights the need for the continued monitoring of autoimmune responses in severe COVID-19 cases. Future research should focus on the long-term persistence and clinical relevance of these autoantibodies, particularly in individuals with pre-existing autoimmune conditions or genetic predispositions.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has been associated with disruption of the airway epithelial barrier, potentially increasing the risk of asthma development. However, whether and how RSV and RSV‐induced IL‐33 contribute to this process are still unclear. In vivo, 7‐day‐old C57BL/6 mice were infected perinasally with RSV, then viral replication, lung inflammation and barrier integrity were evaluated at various time points postinfection. In vitro, human epithelial cells were infected with RSV in the presence or absence of IL‐33, and the expression and localization of apical junction complex proteins (AJC) were assessed by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. The involvement of components of the IL‐33/ST2/MyD88 axis was further verified through blockade of endogenous IL‐33 signaling and pharmacological inhibition of MyD88. Exposure to RSV infection resulted in impairment of the airway epithelial barrier, as indicated by reduced expression of tight junction proteins (ZO‐1, Occludin) and adherents junction protein (E‐cadherin) in the lung tissues. These effects on epithelial barrier disruption were significantly attenuated in St2‐/‐ mice compared with wild‐type controls. In vitro, the RSV‐induced epithelial barrier disruption was exacerbated by topical application of exogenous IL‐33, partially through activation of MyD88‐mediated NF‐κB signaling. Notably, knockdown of St2 by siRNA transfection or pharmacological inhibition of MyD88 partially restored the expression of E‐cadherin, ZO‐1 and Occludin in RSV‐infected epithelial cells. RSV infection triggers robust IL‐33 release from airway epithelial cells, leading to disrupted expression of AJC protein via activation of the MyD88‐dependent NF‐κB signaling pathway. These findings highlight the IL‐33/ST2/MyD88 axis as a critical mediator of epithelial barrier dysfunction, which may represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention in RSV‐mediated lung diseases.">

        <tr id="The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has plunged the world into a major crisis of overwhelming morbidity and mortality and emerged various mutant strains. Patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 develop post-acute COVID syndrome, commonly known as long COVID (LC), lasting up to 12 weeks or even longer. The mechanism has yet to be clarified. COVID-19 pseudovirus is a suitable model to understand the infection of the COVID-19 virus to cells, which is suitable to see the acute change in cells owing to its one-time infection and inactivation. The ACE2-293T cell infected by COVID-19 pseudovirus was used in this study. After the infection and removal of the pseudovirus, high amounts of ferrous ions were accumulated in mitochondria and then released into the cytosol. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was formed and caused mitochondrial dysfunction. To evaluate the effect of nutritional strategy on ferrous ion accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, lactoferrin, Q10 and Echinacea purpurea extract (EPE) were used in this study. Results showed that lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE could improve mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing the accumulation of ferrous ions and ROS in the mitochondria. HPLC analysis showed that EPE contained rich caffeic acid, and it also showed perfect improvement in mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, cells infected with pseudovirus could increase the accumulation of ferrous ions and ROS in mitochondria and be released into the cytosol after removing pseudovirus, thereby causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE were an effective nutritional strategy to suppress ferrous ion accumulation, ROS formation and advanced mitochondrial dysfunction.">

Using SARS-CoV-derived ssRNA sequences, we modeled age-dependent immune responses in mice. Aged mice exhibited higher mortality and severe lung inflammation upon viral ssRNA challenge, mirroring clinical observations. We uncovered a pre-existing inflammatory state in aged mice, characterized by elevated baseline levels of specific immune cells and cytokines correlating with poor outcomes. Age-related immune dysfunction stemmed from impaired IRF7 signaling and defective SNARE-mediated cytokine secretion in CD11b+ cells. Notably, the adoptive transfer of young CD11b+ cells to aged mice exposed to SARS-CoV2 ssRNA reduced mortality, alleviated lung inflammation, and normalized cytokine profiles. These findings provide insights into age-related immune dysregulation during viral challenges and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for severe COVID-19 in the elderly.">

        <tr id="Increased iron levels, common in neurodegenerative diseases, correlate with disease severity, suggesting a role in the pathological process. Recently, efforts have been made to understand the role of iron in cerebral inflammatory processes. Employing astrocyte cell models of genetic neurodegenerative pathologies characterized by iron imbalance, such as the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorders, can provide valuable insights into astrocytes reactivity, a pivotal process in brain inflammation. Specifically, we employed human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes from Neuroferritinopathy, where iron accumulation is primary. After confirming iron accumulation and the deregulation of proteins involved in iron management, we observed that at 35 days since the beginning of differentiation, the elevated iron levels not only trigger ferroptosis but also place the astrocytes in a reactive state. This is evident in the higher extracellular concentrations of IL-6, IL-1β, and glutamate, along with changes in morphology, genes, and proteins involved in astrocyte reactivity. Interestingly, by day 60, IL-6 and IL-1β levels drop below those of the controls, and we observe a reversal in most of the factors considered. Moreover, at day 60, it is possible to observe not only increased senescence but also ferroptosis. These findings demonstrate that iron plays a primary role in inducing astrocyte reactivity.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic infection that affects the central nervous system. However, its high infectivity makes comprehensive research with the active virus challenging. Here, we use virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type mice and in mice that express the human tau protein. VLP exposure elicits changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings in primary somatosensory and motor cortices reveal substantial short-term increases in cortical activity in VLP-injected mice, with increased stimulus-evoked activity in both genotypes and elevated spontaneous activity in the human tau genotype only. Vehicle-injected human tau mice also show increases in cortical activity patterns. Over the following weeks, activity metrics partially subside but do not completely return to baseline levels. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. Middle-aged human tau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background and overexpression of the tau protein, exhibit more severe pathobiology and may be at risk for more adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death, which is characterized by iron overload and accumulation of lipid peroxidation. As a newly identified type of cell death, its involvement in poxvirus infection and pathogenesis remains unclear. Since MPXV shares biological and pathogenic similarities with other poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus (VACV), we used VACV-infected cell and mouse models to demonstrate that VACV infection induces ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of ferroptosis significantly reduce virus replication and alleviates the inflammatory response. Additionally, we observed that VACV infection upregulates prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which contributes to virus-triggered ferroptosis and inflammation. This study identifies a novel form of cell death triggered by poxvirus infection, shedding light on host–pathogen interactions and offering a potential therapeutic target for MPXV and other Orthopoxviruses.">

        <tr id="Post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), i.e., long-lasting pathologies subsequent to infections that do not properly resolve, have both a common core and a broad diversity of manifestations. PAIS include a group of core symptoms (pathological fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disorders and pain) accompanied by a large set of diverse symptoms. Core and diverse additional symptoms, which can persist for years, exhibiting periods of relapses and remissions, usually start suddenly after an apparently common infection. PAIS display highly variable clinical features depending on the nature of the initial pathogen, and to an even larger extent, on the diversity of preexisting individual terrains in which PAIS are rooted. In a first part, I discuss biological issues related to the persistence of microbial antigens, dysregulated immune responses, reactivation of latent viruses, different potential self-sustained inflammatory loops, mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic disorders in the tryptophan- kynurenin pathway (TKP) with impact on serotonin, and consequences of a dysfunctional bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain axis. The second part deals with the nervous system dependence of PAIS. I rely on the concept of interoception, the process by which the brain senses, integrates and interprets signals originating from within the body, and sends feebacks aimed at maintaining homeostasis. Interoception is central for understanding the origin of fatigue, dysautonomia, dysfunctioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and its relation with stress, inflammation or depression. I propose that all individual predispositions leading to self-sustained vicious circles constitute building blocks that can self-assemble in many possible ways, to give rise to both core and diverse features of PAIS. A useful discrimination between different PAIS subtypes should be obtained with a composite profiling including biomarkers, questionnaires and functional tests so as to take into account PAIS multidimensionality.">

        <tr id="Background The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on pituitary function remains unclear, particularly during the acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Case presentation We report the case of a 40-year-old man with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) who was admitted for the evaluation of anterior pituitary function. The patient developed mild COVID-19 during the hospitalization, when we inadvertently observed rapid activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis prior to the onset of fever. At the estimated onset of COVID-19, the patient’s body temperature and the serum level of C-reactive protein remained within normal limits, whereas plasma ACTH levels drastically elevated, and subsequently, serum cortisol levels remain consistently high throughout the day, resulting in increased urinary free cortisol. The serum levels of several cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-1RA, IL-6, and TNF-α, were also significantly elevated compared to those in the non-infected state. Acute suppression of thyroid and gonadal functions was observed approximately one day after the HPA axis activation. Conclusions These findings illustrate the rapid response of the HPA axis to inflammatory factors in the early-stage COVID-19, which may have important implications for understanding the initial host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <tr id="The global dissemination and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become a worldwide crisis with staggering confirmed cases and death tolls. Although prophylactic vaccines are widely applied to curb the spread of the virus, these protections are greatly weakened by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Non-structural protein 12 (NSP12) of SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays an essential role in viral replication and transcription, representing a promising target for drug development. Currently, extensive drugs are designed to specifically target and inhibit NSP12 activity, while highly infectious and drug-resistant variants have significantly compromised their efficacy. Here, we identified that arsenic trioxide (ATO) could specifically reduce not only WT SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 but also mutant NSP12 levels, along with low toxicity. Moreover, the reduction of NSP12 was caused by its robust ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after ATO treatment. Of note, STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1 was found to be the E3 ligase responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of NSP12 by ATO. In short, our findings provide a potential intervention to restrict virus replication and may broaden the scope of therapeutic application for ATO.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been widely recognized as a respiratory illness, yet growing evidence highlights its significant neurological and psychiatric impact. Neuropsychiatric manifestations range from mild symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, to severe conditions including delirium, stroke, and psychosis. These symptoms may occur during the acute phase or persist long after recovery, contributing to what is known as long COVID. The underlying mechanisms are multifactorial, involving direct viral invasion, immune response, and psychosocial stressors. Understanding these effects is essential for comprehensive patient care and for developing long-term strategies in neuropsychiatric evaluation and treatment. This literature review was conducted using scientific publications found in the following databases: Virtual Health Library (BVS), Public Medline (PubMed), CAPES Periodical Portal, and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), with no time restriction. The official websites of the Ministry of Health and gray literature were also consulted. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the extensive neuropsychiatric impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting individuals across all age groups and clinical profiles. Both acute and long-term manifestations—ranging from cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders to severe neurological complications—underscore the virus’s capacity to disrupt central and peripheral nervous system function, as well as mental health. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms, early identification of symptoms, and a multidisciplinary approach to treatment are essential to mitigate these outcomes. Given the ongoing burden of long COVID, continued clinical vigilance, mental health integration into routine care, and investment in longitudinal research are crucial. As we transition from pandemic to endemic phases, addressing the neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 must remain a global public health priority.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Traumatic injury triggers the rapid release of damage‐associated patterns (DAMPs). Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play key roles in sensing, processing, and presenting DAMPs to naïve T cells. These heterogeneous immune cells express the adhesion GPCR EMR2/ADGRE2, which is likely regulated by DAMPs. Methods We analysed the various blood DC and monocyte subsets in trauma patients and uninjured volunteers using flow cytometry. EMR2 and its closest relatives, CD97/ADGRE5 and EMR3/ADGRE3, were quantified on these subsets to gain insights into their (patho)physiological regulation. Results Following trauma, conventional and plasmocytoid DCs nearly disappeared from the circulation, which is inversely correlated with injury severity and adverse clinical parameters 120–240 h post injury. Alterations in EMR2 and CD97 on DCs were relatively minor. Classical monocytes increased, while non‐classical monocytes showed a sustained decline in both absolute number and percentage, in a manner dependent on injury severity after trauma. EMR2 expression increased across all monocyte subsets, whereas CD97 showed little change. EMR3 expression decreased and remained low in classical monocytes, while it markedly increased in non‐classical monocytes. These temporal patterns in adhesion GPRC expression were largely independent of injury severity and were observed in all injured patients. Conclusion Circulating DC and monocyte subsets underwent significant compositional changes after trauma, often correlating with injury severity and other clinical parameters. Despite structural similarities, EMR2, CD97, and EMR3 showed distinct regulatory patterns on monocyte subsets, suggesting different functional roles in the immune response to injury.">

        <tr id="Emerging evidence highlights the profound and lasting impact of severe illnesses such as COVID-19, particularly among individuals with underlying comorbidities. Patients with pre-existing conditions like diabetes mellitus (DM) are disproportionately affected, facing heightened risks of both disease exacerbation and the onset of new complications. Notably, the convergence of advanced age and DM has been consistently associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. However, the long-term metabolic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially its role in disrupting glucose homeostasis and potentially triggering or worsening DM, remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes current clinical and experimental findings to clarify the bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes. We critically examine literature reporting deterioration of glycemic control, onset of hyperglycemia in previously non-diabetic individuals, and worsening of metabolic parameters in diabetic patients after infection. Furthermore, we explore proposed mechanistic pathways, including pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and immune-mediated damage, that may underpin the development or progression of DM in the post-COVID setting. Collectively, this work underscores the urgent need for continued research and clinical vigilance in managing metabolic health in COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a spectrum of disease outcomes in infected humans, ranging from asymptomatic or tolerant to lethal. While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the host’s response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.">

        <tr id="Background: Seasonal influenza infection poses substantial risks to pregnant women, yet the immunological mechanisms underlying their heightened disease susceptibility remain incompletely characterized. Methods: This study employed multiparametric immunophenotyping and metabolic profiling to investigate cellular immunity, cytokine dynamics, and serum biomarkers in pregnant women infected with H3N2 across gestational stages. Through integrated flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), multiple cytokine quantification, and LC-MS-based serum metabolomics, we compared immunological parameters, serum cytokines, and metabolites across trimesters in pregnant women infected and not infected with H3N2. Results: The results revealed reduced CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios, a diminished CD27+ memory B cell population in pregnant women infected with H3N2, and elevated NK cells and Th2-skewed cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) in severe influenza cases. Metabolomic profiling identified the dysregulation of the tryptophan–kynurenine (Trp–Kyn) pathway, with a 15-fold increase in the Kyn/Trp ratio in severe influenza compared to a normal pregnancy as a potential biomarker. Conclusions: These results elucidate synergistic pathophysiological axes-immune dysregulation and tryptophan metabolism alteration that potentially drive adverse outcomes. The identified biomarker panel (CD4/CD8 ratio, IL-6, Kyn/Trp ratio) shows potential clinical promise for early risk stratification in high-risk pregnancies with influenza infection.">

        <tr id="Our understanding of protective immunity after natural viral infections in children with cancer and hematological diseases is restricted. Current cancer treatments cause significant immunosuppression, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity which leads to reduced B-cell and antibody responses. The aim of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 immune response in children with cancer or hematological disease.A single-center study was conducted from June 2020 to June 2023, including 135 patients and 14 healthy siblings. Blood samples were obtained for serological analysis and cell-based assays. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA responses were quantified using suspension multiplex immunoassay (SMIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IgG ELISA) while neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses were assessed by plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). The memory B-cell (MBC) population was evaluated through flow cytometry and MBC responses through FluoroSpot, respectively.In total, 78 patients seroconverted in response to SARS-Co-V-2 but neither immunosuppression nor cancer diagnosis significantly affected seroconversion. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA levels correlated positively with increasing age, and IgA seroconversion was significantly associated with the presence of nAbs. Antigen-specific MBC responses against both spike and receptor-binding domain (RBD) were elevated in older children, while children on immunosuppression had significantly lower RBD IgG-secreting cells.Our results show that most pediatric oncological and hematological patients can mount a broad antibody response upon SARS-CoV-2 natural infection or vaccination, although there is a variability in their responses influenced by increasing age. MBC responses in children with immunosuppression were blunted with fewer RBD IgG-secreting cells. Essentially, our findings underscore that young children with severe treatment-related immunosuppression are at risk for less effective B-cell responses upon viral infection.">

        <tr id="The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes serious respiratory illness and related disorders. Vulnerable populations, including those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and the elderly, face an increased risk of severe complications. As the pandemic evolves, various diagnostic techniques are available to detect severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), including clinical presentation, rapid antigen/antibody testing, molecular testing, supplemental laboratory analysis, and imaging. Based on peer-reviewed data, treatment options include convalescent plasma transfusion, corticosteroids, antivirals, and immunomodulatory medications. Convalescent plasma therapy, historically used in outbreaks like Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and SARS, is suggested by the World Health Organization for critically ill COVID-19 patients when vaccines or antiviral drugs are unavailable. Neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma help control viral load and improve patient outcomes, especially when administered early, though effectiveness varies. The United States Food and Drug Administration has authorized its emergency use for severe COVID-19 cases, but potential risks such as transfusion reactions and transfusion-related acute lung injury require further investigation to establish definitive efficacy. Antiviral agents like Remdesivir, an adenosine nucleotide analog, inhibit viral RNA polymerase and have shown efficacy in reducing COVID-19 severity, leading to its emergency use authorization for hospitalized patients. Other antivirals like ritonavir, lopinavir, and umifenovir disrupt viral replication and entry, but their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has been used in critically ill COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation and prevent respiratory failure, as shown in the RECOVERY trial. Other immunosuppressants like ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and colchicine help modulate the immune response, reducing cytokine storms and inflammation-related complications. However, corticosteroids carry risks such as hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, and delayed viral clearance, requiring careful administration. Systematic reviews of clinical studies revealed that hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin did not decrease viral load nor reduce the severity of symptoms, but increased mortality among acutely hospitalized patients. There was no improvement in patients’ clinical conditions after 15 days compared to standard treatment. The United States Food and Drug Administration has revoked the authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients due to the null benefit-risk balance. Monoclonal antibodies like itolizumab, gimsilumab, sarilumab, and tocilizumab are being studied for their ability to reduce the severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, particularly cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These antibodies target specific immune pathways to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, with some showing promising results in clinical trials, though their use remains under investigation. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas13 family of enzymes, sequenced from many COVID-19-positive patients, can potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, cleave the RNA genome, and aid in the amplification of the genome assay. Cas13 can also target emerging pathogens via an adeno-associated virus vector when delivered to the infected lungs. In addition to pharmacological agents, vaccines effectively prevent symptomatic infection, reduce hospitalizations, minimize mortality rates, and ultimately reduce the severity of the disease. This paper aims to explore the management of patients with underlying conditions who present with COVID-19 to lessen the burden on healthcare systems.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: This study examines the longitudinal dynamics of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) and anti-spike (anti-S) antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA vaccination based on 81,878 serum samples from 23,616 healthcare workers (HCWs) across five European countries. It includes data across four scheduled vaccine doses—predominantly BNT162b2—with 25% of samples originating from individuals with confirmed prior infection, as evidenced by elevated anti-S levels, positive Anti-N antibodies, or PCR results. Methods: The study employed a shifted transformation method for data normalization and utilized the Bass diffusion model to predict antibody titer dynamics influenced by both internal factors—such as immune activation contextualized through sociodemographic issues—and external factors, including infection and vaccination. Despite the absence of direct measurements for some internal variables, the model effectively inferred their impact, enabling a rigorous and nuanced delineation of immune response profiles. Results: The Bass diffusion model rigorously captured variations in antibody titers, analyzed through demographic factors such as gender, age, and job role, while thoroughly accounting for pre-infection status. The results indicate that Anti-N antibodies, exclusively produced post-infection, exhibited a rapid decline, while anti-S antibodies, generated from both infection and vaccination, demonstrated prolonged persistence. A significant decline in anti-S levels was observed 3–5 months post-vaccination, with adaptive immunity—characterized by the dominance of internal factors effects relative to external ones—achieved in most groups after the fourth dose. However, adaptive immunity post second dose was limited to specific demographics. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the significance of the Bass Method in predicting vaccine-induced, hybrid immune responses and detecting adaptive immunity by overcoming limitations in internal factor data, thereby advancing effective vaccination and infection control strategies during public health crises. These findings highlight the Bass Method’s value in predicting vaccine-induced and hybrid immunity, effectively addressing internal factor data gaps to enhance vaccination and infection control strategies.">

        <tr id="Growing evidence of post-COVID neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment, suggests SARS-CoV-2 viral infection into the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral entry into the CNS, where human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is barely expressed, is critical for addressing the neurological consequences of COVID-19. Importantly, the low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3) is overexpressed in brain cells, suggesting a possible ACE2-independent alternate pathway of viral entry into brain cells. Herein, we report the interaction of the chemically synthesized LRAD3 domains with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We observed that the extracellular domains of LRAD3 depend on calcium for proper folding and maintaining their structural integrity. Our results revealed that domain 1 of LRAD3, which is most accessible from the cell surface, engages with the N-terminal domain of the viral spike protein. These findings open up possibilities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 independent viral entry pathways.">

        <tr id="Abstract Purpose Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), driven by unresolved neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunction. This study evaluates chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection of HIV-1-induced neurometabolic impairments and ART-mediated improvements in a humanized mouse model. Methods HIV-1-infected CD34-NSG mice (n = 14) underwent CEST MRI to quantify metabolic profiles in the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, piriform cortex, and thalamus at three timepoints: pre-infection (Week 0), 6 weeks-post-infection (WPI), and after 6 weeks of ART- or vehicle-treatment (12 WPI). CEST contrasts were analyzed at 2 ppm (creatine), 3 ppm (glutamate), and − 3.5 ppm (nuclear Overhauser effect, NOE). Neuroinflammation and infection were confirmed using immunohistology and qPCR. Results At 6 WPI, HIV-1-infection reduced creatine in the cortex (p = 0.0006) and hippocampus (p = 0.01), and elevated NOE in the cortex (p = 0.001). At 12 WPI, vehicle-treated HIV-infected mice exhibited significantly decreased glutamate in the cortex (p = 0.004), hippocampus (p < 0.0001), and piriform cortex (p = 0.002); ART-treatment restored these levels in the cortex and hippocampus. Further, vehicle-treated mice exhibited decreased creatine in the cortex (p = 0.0002), hippocampus (p = 0.0003), piriform cortex (p = 0.0009), and thalamus (p = 0.006); ART-treatment restored these levels in the hippocampus, piriform cortex, and thalamus. Finally, vehicle-treated mice exhibited increased NOE in the cortex (p = 0.002) and thalamus (p = 0.003), but this was not restored by ART. CEST findings were supported by reductions in HIV-1 p24 + cells and neuroinflammatory markers in ART-treated brains. Discussion CEST MRI detects region-specific HIV-1-induced neurometabolic alterations and ART-mediated restorations. This work establishes CEST MRI as a translational potential, non-invasive technique for monitoring HAND pathology and therapeutic efficacy.">

        <tr id="Leigh syndrome (LS) is the most common pediatric presentation of genetic mitochondrial disease and characterized by neurological and metabolic abnormalities. The hallmark of the disease is the presence of progressive, bilateral, symmetric neurodegenerative lesions in the brainstem and/or basal ganglia. Recent studies in the Ndufs4(-/-) mouse model of LS indicate that disease is causally driven by the immune system. Both microglia and peripherally originating macrophages are enriched in the lesions of Ndufs4(-/-) mice and pharmacologic elimination of these cell types prevents disease indicating a crucial role for innate immune cells. Here, we investigated the role of the adaptive immune system in Ndufs4(-/-) disease pathogenesis. We crossed Ndufs4(-/-) mice with mice expressing a null form of interleukin 2 receptor gamma (Il2rg) and monitored disease onset and progression. Il2rg knockout (KO) mice have dramatically depleted numbers of B-, T-, the adaptive immune system’s key cellular actors, and NK-cells. We observed no difference in neurological disease progression or overall survival between Ndufs4(-/-)/Il2rg(WT) and Ndufs4(-/-)/Il2rg(KO) mice, strongly suggesting that T cells, B cells, and NK cells do not play a significant role in CNS disease pathogenesis in Ndufs4(-/-) mice. Combined with previous studies indicating a causal role for macrophages, we conclude that LS CNS pathology is primarily driven by the monocyte/macrophage innate immune system.">

        <tr id="We recently developed an original HCV-permissive cell culture model based on both partial differentiation and physiological oxygen pressure (Hypo-Diff cells) that produces highly infectious lipid-rich and native-like HCV-lipoviroparticles (LVPs). Here, we explored the precise role of physiological hypoxia and related specific transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and 2α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) to better understand the mechanism governing viral morphogenesis. Knocking-down HIF-2α specifically reduced both the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets in Huh7.5 Hypo-Diff cells, suggesting a central role for HIF-2 in controlling lipid metabolism under physiological hypoxia. In HCV-infected siHIF-2α Hypo-Diff cells, both HCV replication and the specific infectious viral efficacy of progeny viruses were significantly impaired. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of a mutated form of the HIF-2α protein, stabilized in normoxia, both increased the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets and restored the production of highly infectious HCV viruses in the absence of cell differentiation. Finally, by iodixanol fractionation of supernatants to determine the mean buoyant density of infectious HCV LVPs, we established that HIF-2α is exclusively responsible for producing highly lipidated and broadly infectious HCV-LVPs by Hypo-Diff cells. These findings thus clearly establish the central role of physiological hypoxia, and notably HIF-2, in the production of highly infectious lipid-rich native-like HCV particles. Since physiological hypoxia is a shared characteristic in mammalian tissues, we propose to reconsider the role of natural oxygen tension and especially the role of HIF-2 in the life cycle of other lipid-associated viruses, whether hepatotropic or not.

        <tr id="Brain atrophy is a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and more recently SARS‐CoV‐2 infection for which the neuroinflammatory mechanism is not fully understood. Nevertheless, neuroinflammation and CD8 T cell accumulation is frequently observed in postmortem brain tissue of patients with neurodegeneration. We therefore developed a murine model of brain atrophy using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection model of multiple sclerosis. We employ single major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule conditional knockout mice generated by our program to analyze the contribution of immune cell infiltration and onset of atrophy. TMEV infected C57BL/6 mice that singularly express H‐2Kb or H‐2Db were evaluated. TMEV infection of these mice resulted in ventricular atrophy at 14 d.p.i. However, H‐2Db expressing mice presented with significantly greater and continuous ventricular atrophy compared to H‐2Kb expressing mice and MHC class I knockout control mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed H‐2Db expressing mice had greater brain infiltrating CD8 T cell responses at 7 and 28 dpi which correlated with the extent of ventricular atrophy. Meanwhile, H‐2Kb and MHC class I knockout mice also had distinct positive correlations with ventricular atrophy and global neuroinflammation in general. These findings support the role of immune cell infiltration into the CNS as a putative mechanism of ventricular atrophy following TMEV infection, with the progressive enlargement of ventricular atrophy observed in H‐2Db mice being associated with the presence of long‐lived memory CD8 T cells residing in the brain.">

In this study, human endothelial permeability was assessed using TEER and transwell permeability assays. Signaling pathways were determined by RNAseq. The ability of the NS1 protein of TBEV to affect human endothelial permeability was investigated for the first time. It was shown that recombinant TBEV NS1 produced in eucaryotic cells directly affected human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) in vitro but not human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

        <tr id="People with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) may be more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 outcomes. COVID-19 vaccination is a key element in mitigating this risk. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Ab), including anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) Ab, are metrics of seroconversion following COVID-19 vaccination in the general population. We assessed if anti-S and anti-RBD antibodies were negatively correlated with COVID-19 infection in IMID.SUCCEED, a prospective Canada-wide study, was conducted in 2 phases. First, between Feb 2021-Jul 2023, adult IMID participants provided dried blood spot samples for anti-S and anti-RBD ELISA testing at intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Second, between Sep 2022-Aug 2023, consenting participants from 4 academic centers in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec (2) also provided monthly saliva samples for PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. We studied subjects receiving at least their primary series (3+ doses) of a COVID-19 vaccine. Multivariable general estimating equation (GEE) models (accounting for repeated measures) evaluated PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva, assessing the effects of anti-S or anti-RBD levels (in separate models) within the 6 months preceding a given saliva sample. We controlled for recent COVID-19 infection, sex, age, medications (conventional immunosuppressives, biologics, and prednisone), and time since last COVID vaccine.366 participants contributed 1,266 saliva samples. Participants were 79.8% female and 85.5% White, with median age 56.7 (standard deviation: 13.8) years. Most participants were taking immunosuppressants (N=252, 68.9%). The majority (N=356, 97.3%) of participants displayed seroconversion at the first saliva sample, defined as ≥11.3 Binding Antibody Units (BAU)/ml for anti-S or ≥31 BAU/ml for anti-RBD. In the GEE models of positive saliva PCR for SARS-CoV-2, (Table 1) a 1000 BAU/ml increase in anti-S was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-0.97). Anti-RBD Ab levels had a similar effect (aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81-1.02).Table 1:Odds Ratios, OR (95% confidence intervals, CI) for Having a Positive COVID-19 Saliva Test in Univariable and Multivariable GEE ModelsIn this large, multi-center sample of COVID-19-vaccinated individuals with IMIDs, most of whom were immunosuppressed, we demonstrated that anti-S Ab levels were associated with lower odds of positive saliva PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, with a similar trend for anti-RBD Ab.

        <tr id="Introduction Severe injury, including burn trauma, leads to profound immune dysfunction, yet the mechanisms driving these changes remain incompletely defined. This lack of understanding has hindered efforts to modulate the immune response effectively. Additionally, a clear biomarker profile to guide clinicians in identifying burn patients at high risk for poor clinical outcomes is lacking. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as novel mediators of immune dysfunction in various pathologies. Prior studies in mouse models have demonstrated that plasma EVs increase following burn injury and contribute to immune dysfunction. Furthermore, EVs have potential as biomarkers for predicting extended hospital stays in burn patients. This study hypothesizes that human EVs, purified early and late after burn injury, will exhibit immune reprogramming effects similar to those observed in mice and that specific EV protein cargo may serve as biomarkers of immune and physiological responses to burn injury. Methods EVs were isolated from the plasma of burn-injury patients at early (<72h) and late (≥14 days) time points post-injury. Using unbiased immune transcriptome and bioinformatic causal network analyses, the immunomodulatory effects of these EVs were assessed in human THP-1 macrophages. Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics and pathway analyses were conducted to characterize the protein cargo of EVs from both human and mouse models at different post-burn phases. Results Early post-burn human EVs induced significant immune reprogramming in macrophages, increasing pro-inflammatory signaling while suppressing anti-inflammatory pathways. In contrast, late post-burn EVs exhibited an immunosuppressive profile, with downregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways and upregulation of anti-inflammatory signaling. Proteomic analyses revealed that human and mouse EVs contained unique and overlapping protein cargo across different time points. At day 7 post-burn, mouse EVs were enriched in circulation/complement and neuronal proteins, whereas by day 14, reductions in membrane and metabolism-associated proteins were observed. Similarly, in human EVs at 14 days post-burn, increased levels of circulation/complement, immune, and transport proteins were detected. Conclusions EVs from burn-injury patients at distinct time points differentially modulate immune responses in macrophages, mirroring the temporal immune phenotypes observed in clinical settings. These findings suggest that EV-macrophage interactions play a crucial role in burn-induced immune dysfunction and highlight the potential of EV protein cargo as biomarkers for immune status and patient outcomes following burn injury.">

        <tr id="Leptospira interrogans is the major causative agent of leptospirosis. Humans, canines and livestock animals are susceptible to Leptospira species and can develop fulminant disease. Rodents serve as reservoir hosts in which the bacteria colonize the renal tubules and are excreted in the urine. The host immune response to Leptospira spp. remains poorly defined. We show that L. interrogans induces a robust type I interferon (IFN) response in human and murine macrophages that is dependent on the cytosolic dsDNA sensor Cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) and the Stimulator of IFN Genes (STING) signaling pathway. Further, we show that mice deficient in the IFNα/β receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) or STING had higher bacterial burdens and increased renal colonization following infection in vivo suggesting that cGAS-STING-driven type I IFN is required for the host defense against L. interrogans. These findings demonstrate the significance of cGAS-STING-dependent type I IFN signaling in mammalian innate immune responses to L. interrogans. Author Summary Leptospirosis is a globally distributed zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. While humans, livestock, and dogs can develop severe or even fatal illness upon infection, rodents typically serve as asymptomatic reservoir hosts. A defining feature of the leptospiral life cycle is the ability of the pathogen to colonize the kidney in these reservoir host species, leading to prolonged urinary shedding and environmental dissemination. Despite the significant global burden of leptospirosis, the innate immune pathways that detect this pathogen and prevent renal colonization remain poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that L. interrogans induces a robust type I IFN cytokine response from macrophages. The induction of this type I IFN response is dependent on sensing cytosolic DNA by the cGAS-STING pathway. Using in vivo mouse models of L. interrogans infection we further show that activation of this pathway is required to control bacterial burdens and reduce long-term kidney colonization. This study is the first to demonstrate a critical role for cGAS-STING and type I IFN in controlling L. interrogans infection.">

In an effort to adapt the virus to grow more rapidly in these cells through the serial passaging of viral progeny, we were unsuccessful. Here, we found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by BoAHV-1-infected A549 cells (referred to as EDVs) contain 59 viral proteins, including both viral structure proteins (such as gC and gD) and viral regulatory proteins (such as bICP4 and bICP22), as identified via a proteomic analysis. These EDVs can bind to and enter target cells, inhibit viral particles binding to cells, and stimulate the production of IFN-α and IFN-β in A549 cells. When EDVs are inoculated into rabbits via either the conjunctival sacs or intravenously, they can be readily detected in neurons within the trigeminal ganglia (TG), where they reduce viral replication and promote the transcription of IFN-γ. Furthermore, incorporation of the known anti-herpesvirus drug Acyclovir (ACY) into the EDVs leads to synergistically enhanced antiviral efficacy. Collectively, the EDVs exhibit antiviral effects by blocking viral binding to target cells and stimulating the innate immune response, thereby leading to the failure of the serial passaging of viral progeny in these cells, and these EDVs may serve as a promising vector for delivering drugs targeting TG tissues for antiviral purposes.">

        <tr id="Severe dengue is a global health threat, affecting 4 billion people, with nearly 1 million hospitalizations during epidemics and around 25,000 annual deaths. Severe dengue presentations are characterized by vascular leakage, hemorrhagic manifestations, and shock, which can lead to multiorgan failure. Recent studies highlight the crucial role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the pathogenesis of dengue, influencing immune response and disease progression. EVs, nanometric structures secreted by cells, mediate viral dissemination, immune modulation, and endothelial dysfunction by transporting biomolecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and viral proteins. Infected cell-derived EVs carry viral components, including NS protein and miRNAs like miR-21 and miR-126-5p, which compromise endothelial integrity and activate immune pathways such as Toll-like receptor, NF-κB, and JAK-STAT signaling. This, together with the immune response, leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ. EVs also facilitate viral immune evasion by suppressing antiviral responses. Recent analyses of miRNAs within EVs suggest their potential as biomarkers for disease progression. Differentially expressed miRNAs in circulating EVs correlate with severe outcomes, providing tools for risk stratification and therapeutic monitoring. Advanced techniques, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis and flow cytometry, allow precise EV characterization, supporting their integration into clinical applications.">

        <tr id="The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a neurotropic flavivirus, poses a formidable global health challenge due to its severe neurological sequelae and high lethality. Peripheral immune effectors, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and T lymphocytes, act as principal vectors of neuropathogenic exacerbation by translocating across a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB). These cells perpetuate an inflammatory cascade within the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by unchecked cytokine dysregulation and collateral neuronal destruction. Exosomes, diminutive extracellular vesicles, emerge as cryptic propagators of JEV neuropathogenesis. Acting as molecular couriers, these vesicles disseminate viral RNA and proinflammatory mediators, thus orchestrating neuronal apoptosis and fostering a pernicious inflammatory microenvironment. Exosomal trafficking exacerbates BBB destabilization, potentiates immune cell ingress into the CNS, and establishes a deleterious feedback mechanism of neuroinflammation and cellular attrition. This review underscores the intricate crosstalk between peripheral immune infiltrates and exosomal vectors in JEV progression, advocating for advanced therapeutic paradigms aimed at intercepting exosomal biogenesis, attenuating immune hyperactivation, and preserving BBB integrity to mitigate CNS devastation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Numerous pathogens, including viruses, enter the central nervous system and cause neurological disorders, such as encephalitis. Viruses are the main etiologic agents of such neurological diseases, and some of them cause a high death toll worldwide. Our knowledge about neuroinvasive and encephalitogenic virus infections is still limited due to the relative inaccessibility of the brain. To mitigate this shortcoming, neural ex vivo models have been developed and turned out to be of paramount importance for understanding neuroinvasive and neurotropic viruses. In this review, we describe the major ex vivo models for the central nervous system, including neural cultures, brain organoids, and organotypic brain cultures. We highlight the key findings from these models and illustrate how these models inform on viral processes, including neurotropism, neuroinvasion, and neurovirulence. We discuss the limitations of ex vivo models, highlight ongoing progress, and outline next-generation ex vivo models for virus research at the interface of neuroscience and infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an arthropod-borne, positive-sense RNA alphavirus posing a substantial threat to public health. Unlike similar viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, EEEV replicates efficiently in neurons, producing progeny viral particles as soon as 3–4 hours post-infection. EEEV infection, which can cause severe encephalitis with a human mortality rate surpassing 30%, has no licensed, targeted therapies, leaving patients to rely on supportive care. Although the general characteristics of EEEV infection within the host cell are well-studied, it remains unclear how these interactions lead to rapid production of progeny viral particles, limiting development of antiviral therapies. Here, we present a novel rule-based model that describes attachment, entry, uncoating, replication, assembly, and export of both infectious virions and virus-like particles within mammalian cells. Additionally, it quantitatively characterizes host ribosome activity in EEEV replication via a model parameter defining ribosome density on viral RNA. To calibrate the model, we performed experiments to quantify viral RNA, protein, and infectious particle production during acute infection. We used Bayesian inference to calibrate the model, discovering in the process that an additional constraint was required to ensure consistency with previous experimental observations of a high ratio between the amounts of full-length positive-sense viral genome and negative-sense template strand. Overall, the model recapitulates the experimental data and predicts that EEEV rapidly concentrates host ribosomes densely on viral RNA. Dense packing of host ribosomes was determined to be critical to establishing the characteristic positive to negative RNA strand ratio because of its role in governing the kinetics of transcription. Sensitivity analysis identified viral transcription as the critical step for infectious particle production, making it a potential target for future therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a poliomyelitis-like illness causing paralysis in young children. However, mechanisms of paralysis are unclear, and antiviral therapies are lacking. To better understand EV-D68 disease, we inoculated newborn mice intracranially to assess viral tropism, virulence, and immune responses. Wild-type (WT) mice inoculated intracranially with a neurovirulent strain of EV-D68 showed infection of spinal cord neurons and developed paralysis. Spinal tissue from infected mice revealed increased chemokines, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and T cells relative to controls, suggesting that immune cell infiltration influences pathogenesis. To define the contribution of cytokine-mediated immune cell recruitment to disease, we inoculated mice lacking CCR2, a receptor for several EV-D68-upregulated cytokines, or RAG1, which is required for lymphocyte maturation. WT, Ccr2-/-, and Rag1-/- mice had comparable viral titers in spinal tissue. However, Ccr2-/- and Rag1-/- mice were significantly less likely to be paralyzed relative to WT mice. Consistent with impaired T cell recruitment to sites of infection in Ccr2-/- and Rag1 -/- mice, antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from WT mice diminished paralysis. These results indicate that immune cell recruitment to the spinal cord promotes EV-D68-associated paralysis and illuminate new targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that caused one of the most significant pandemics in the modern world. Although vaccination and treatment options have advanced, understanding host-related factors influencing disease severity remains critical, especially in the context of emerging variants and long-term complications. Since the beginning, numerous research studies have been conducted to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the severe onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D are known for their positive impact on multiple conditions. Nevertheless, clinical trials suggested that vitamin D deficiency did not have as substantial a role as expected in conditions including asthma, cardiovascular or autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Moreover, low vitamin D levels could result from the ongoing inflammatory process. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using immunoenzymatic tests (ELISA). Furthermore, the expression of the ORF1ab gene was detected, and the obtained results were correlated with laboratory parameters to establish their potential impact on the course of the disease. Severe 25(OH)D deficiency was found in subjects with active SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed a significant relationship between 25(OH)D and extended hospitalization time. No link was demonstrated between vitamin D levels and clinical manifestations. Lower 25(OH)D values were associated with lower values of leukocytes, neutrophils and ferritin. In summary, our findings highlight the relevance of vitamin D status as a potential modulator of immune response and disease course in SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the importance of continued investigation into host nutritional and inflammatory profiles during COVID-19.">

This study examined viral-induced bacterial adhesion in an ex vivo pediatric airway model and the therapeutic potential of Echinacea purpurea extract. Methods EpiAirway tissue from a 6-year-old boy was infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), or rhinovirus 14 (RV14). Adhesion of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) was assessed alongside the expression of platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFr), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule-1 (CEACAM-1). Echinaforce® (EF extract) was tested for its effect on bacterial dysregulation. Results RSV and HPIV3 increased bacterial adhesion by upregulating PAFr, ICAM-1, and CEACAM-1. Hib adhered primarily via ICAM-1, while S. pneumoniae favored PAFr. RV14 strongly induced CEACAM-1 but did not cause significant bacterial dysregulation. EF significantly reduced virus-induced receptor overexpression, resulting in inhibition of bacterial adhesion and biofilm-like formation. Conclusion Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed effects of E. purpurea in reducing RTI complications and the need for antibiotic prescriptions in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bacterial and fungal pathogens are major causes of infectious endophthalmitis following eye surgery or trauma, often leading to vision impairment or blindness. The distinct clinical outcomes observed in bacterial and fungal endophthalmitis suggest differences in host immune responses. To investigate these differences, we utilized cytokine arrays and murine models of bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus) and fungal (Aspergillus fumigatus) endophthalmitis. Our analysis revealed that cytokine responses peaked in bacterial infections at 12–24 h, whereas fungal infections exhibited a delayed peak at 48 h. Several inflammatory mediators, including MMP9, MMP3, CD14, LIX, LCN2, retinol-binding protein 4, ICAM1, and VCAM1, were differentially elevated. Notably, interleukin-33 (IL-33) levels peaked early in bacterial infections but continued to rise throughout all time points in fungal endophthalmitis. Analysis of patient vitreous samples further confirmed higher levels of IL-33 in bacterial (n=40) and fungal (n=20) endophthalmitis cases. Functional studies in IL-33-deficient mice revealed an increased fungal burden and elevated TNF-α and IL-6 levels, but bacterial endophthalmitis severity remains largely unaffected. Additionally, bone marrow-derived macrophages from IL-33−/− mice exhibited increased cell death in response to fungal and bacterial infection. Our findings reveal divergent innate immune responses between bacterial and fungal endophthalmitis and emphasize the immunomodulatory function of IL-33 in ocular infections.">

In this study, we investigated the effect of IL‐37 treatment on the SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron‐infection induced inflammatory response and its molecular mechanism. Our results demonstrated that IL‐37 treatment effectively alleviated symptoms, reduced viral loads, suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines both systemically (in serum) and locally (in the lungs), and attenuated lung lesions and inflammatory cell infiltration in Omicron‐infected mice. The suppressed proinflammatory factors were macrophage‐related, particularly CCL3 and CCL4, which were significantly inhibited. Furthermore, treatment with IL‐37 significantly reduced the proportion of M1‐type macrophages in lungs of Omicron‐infected mice. In addition, we found that IL‐37 targeted M1 macrophages through modulation of the NF‐κB signaling pathway to suppress the production of proinflammtory factors during Omicron infection.

Central to its pathogenesis is a dysregulated immune response. In this study, we performed a comprehensive multi-omics analysis on transcriptomic datasets retrieved from the GEO database, including samples from sepsis patients (n = 23) and healthy controls (n = 27). and identified a pivotal role of Interleukin-1 receptor 2 (IL-1R2) in modulating inflammatory responses in sepsis. Transcriptomic integration revealed activation of critical signaling pathways, including NFκB/NLRP3, associated with sepsis-induced immune dysregulation. We identified a pivotal role of Interleukin-1 receptor 2 (IL-1R2) in modulating inflammatory responses in sepsis, with IL-1R2 showing a 2.1-fold upregulation in septic patients. Transcriptomic integration revealed the activation of 42 significantly enriched signaling pathways, with 26 upregulated and 26 downregulated pathways. Notably, the NFκB/NLRP3 signaling axis emerged as a central hub of immune dysregulation. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis highlighted “neutrophil activation involved in immune response” as the top biological process. Our findings suggest that IL-1R2 functions as a key immunoregulatory molecule and represents a promising therapeutic target. Moreover, we observed distinct patterns of oxidative stress regulation and immune cell activation, with potential biomarkers correlating with disease severity. These insights not only enhance the molecular understanding of sepsis but also point toward novel precision therapeutic strategies focused on modulating inflammation to improve patient outcomes.">

To elucidate the mechanisms of viral pneumonia progression and potential targets for its treatment.Viral pneumonia models were induced by the PR8 virus strain in wild-type (WT) and STING knockout (STING-KO) mice. Series of molecular biology techniques were used to evaluate the severity of pneumonia and cytokine levels.In this study, STING (stimulator of interferon genes) was activated in the lungs of virus-infected mice, leading to cytokine production and amplification of the immune response, thereby causing rapid deterioration of symptoms. Furthermore, excessive activation of innate immune response via STING was prevented by a STING inhibitor (C-176), which significantly reduced viral lung inflammation. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was similarly suppressed during viral pneumonia treatment with STING inhibitors (C-176), and NETs formation and STING expression were positively correlated, indicating that STING plays an important role in NETs formation. Symptoms of pneumonia in STING-KO mice infected with PR8 were significantly milder than those in WT mice, and NETs were less likely to form in the lung tissue of STING-KO mice. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed that STING-mediated regulation of NETs may be associated with gasdermin D (GSDMD), and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that STING, GSDMD, and NETs-related proteins interact with each other. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that in neutrophils from WT mice, STING and GSDMD were colocalized on the membrane after viral infection, whereas in neutrophils from STING-KO mice, GSDMD expression was decreased after exposure to the virus.Our study demonstrated that targeted intervention with STING alleviated pneumonia by inhibiting inflammation and NETs formation. The study also revealed that blocking STING could inhibit the activation of GSDMD to inhibit NETs formation, slowing the progression of viral pneumonia.">

        <tr id="The deployment of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is a major landmark in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the activation of adaptive immunity and its longevity after a booster dose warrant further investigation. Moreover, the interplay between inflammation and immune thrombosis after transfection needs further insights that could help examine the vaccine’s potential for adverse events following immunization (AEFIs). This study investigates the biochemical and hematological responses to the third dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 68 healthy participants who had previously received two doses of the vaccine. Blood samples were collected at baseline (before vaccine dose; D0), 48 hours post-vaccination (D2), and then at days 30, 60, 120, and 180 (D30, D60, D120, D180). The study focused on analyzing changes in anti-SARS-COV-2 immunoglobulins (IgG and IgA), inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IFN-γ, CRP, hs-CRP), coagulation factors (PT, APTT, D-dimers), and blood cell counts (neutrophils, leukocytes, platelets) at D2 post-vaccination, and IgG and IgA at days 2, 30, 60, 120, and 180 post-vaccination. In this study, no clinical AEFIs were observed in any of the recipients. Slight changes were observed in the levels of inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers, and blood cells. Levels of CRP and hs-CRP increased slightly but significantly, d-dimers were raised, and PT and aPTT were prolonged significantly. A small but significant decrease was observed in IFN-γ and mean lymphocyte counts, whereas no change was observed in the levels of IL-6, neutrophils, and platelet count at D2. Levels of IgG and IgA showed sustained increase over the six-month period. These results collectively demonstrate that the third dose of the mRNA vaccine elicits a rapid and sustained immune response characterized by increased IgG and IgA levels. The changes observed in inflammatory markers and coagulation factors after vaccination observed shortly after vaccination require further investigations.">

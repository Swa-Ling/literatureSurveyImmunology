        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context-dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases. We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT2. Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model, revealing SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells (macrophages and T lymphocytes) and repair Schwann cells, as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve-resident cell types. Notably, endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines (Ccl9, Cxcl5) and complement components (C3, C4b, C6) in response to chronic SARM1 activation, indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non-immune nerve-resident cells. Analysis of CD45+ immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b+ macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation. We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves. Remarkably, T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model. These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1-dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease.

        <tr id="Peripheral surgery evokes neuroimmune activation in the central nervous system and modulates immune cell polarization in the ischemic brain. However, the phenotypic change of microglia and myeloid cells within post-surgical ischemic brain tissue remain poorly defined. Using an integrated approach that combines single-cell RNA sequencing with comprehensive biological analysis in a perioperative ischemic stroke (PIS) model, we identified a distinct Spp1-positive macrophage/microglia (Spp1+ Mac/MG) subgroup that exhibit enriched anti-inflammatory pathways with distinct lipid metabolic reprogrammed profile. Moreover, using immunofluorescence staining, we identified the expression of Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) in Spp1+F4/80+ cells and Spp1+Iba-1+ cells. Intraperitoneal administration of semaglutide, a GLP1R agonist clinically approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulted in a significant reduction of cerebral infarct volume in PIS mice compared to that in ischemic stroke (IS) mice. Meanwhile, semaglutide treatment also increased the proportion of Spp1+Edu+Iba-1+ cells 3 days after PIS. Using high-parameter flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining and RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that semaglutide treatment significantly attenuated the expression of neuroinflammatory markers in mice following PIS. We also found that semaglutide treatment significantly ameliorated sensorimotor dysfunction up to 3 days after PIS in mice. Our current finding reveal a novel protective Spp1+Mac/MG subset after PIS and demonstrated that it can be upregulated by semaglutide. We propose that targeting Spp1+Mac/MG subsets using semaglutide could serve as a promising strategy to attenuate the exacerbated neuroinflammation in PIS.

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory CNS disease with heterogeneous manifestation. Prognostic markers for early classification of MS are currently under investigation. Higher diagnostic resolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to contribute significantly to patient stratification, which should be especially important for a subgroup of patients with high risk to convert to a progressive disease course. This study aimed to determine whether spectral flow cytometry of CSF cells could identify pathogenic CD4+ T cell subset in MS. Using a two-step approach, we designed a marker panel informed by publicly available transcriptomic datasets from early human MS and our own single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine MS model. Notably, chronic (‘phase’) markers such as Il7r and Ramp3 (associated with memory T cells), Itgb1 (integrin beta-1) and anti-apoptotic genes like Dnaja1, Hsph1 and Jun/AP-1 were enriched in EAE. These markers reflect pro-survival signalling and tissue-residency characteristics, including CXCR6, CD69 and Bhlhe40, which suggest an adaptation of CD4+ T cells towards persistent neuroinflammatory responses in chronic EAE. This phase-specific marker profile highlights CD4+ T cells as both indicators and contributors to disease progression in EAE. Translating these findings to MS datasets, we found an enrichment of phase-specific markers in CSF cells. Spectral flow cytometry in an independent MS cohort revealed distinct memory and effector T cell subsets, indicating unique CSF signatures in MS. This study underscores the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of CD4+ T cells detectable by spectral flow cytometry, enhancing diagnostic resolution of CSF cells and informing more precise therapeutic strategies for MS.">

        <tr id="Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. The choroid plexus (ChP), serving as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier, plays essential roles in immune response to stress and brain homeostasis. However, the cellular and molecular contributions of the ChP to AD progression remain inadequately understood. Methods To elucidate the molecular abnormalities during the early stages of AD, we acquired single-cell transcription profiling of ChP from APP/PS1 mice with early-stage of Aβ pathology and litter-mate controls. The transcriptional alterations that occurred in each cell type were identified by differentially expressed genes, cell–cell communications and pseudotemporal trajectory analysis. The findings were subsequently validated by a series of in situ and in vitro assays. Results We constructed a comprehensive atlas of ChP at single-cell resolution and identified six major cell types and immune subclusters in male mice. The majority of dysregulated genes were found in the epithelial cells of APP/PS1 mice in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice, and most of these genes belonged to down-regulated module involved in mitochondrial respirasome assembly, cilium organization, and barrier integrity. The disruption of the epithelial barrier resulted in the downregulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) secretion in APP/PS1 mice, leading to macrophage activation and increased phagocytosis of Aβ. Concurrently, ligands (e.g., APOE) secreted by macrophages and other ChP cells facilitated the entry of lipids into ependymal cells, leading to lipid accumulation and the activation of microglia in the brain parenchyma in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT controls. Conclusions Taken together, these data profiled early transcriptional and cellular abnormalities of ChP within an AD mouse model, providing novel insights of cerebral vasculature into the pathobiology of AD.

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune‐stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA‐seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell–cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage–endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage‐derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage‐driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.">

        <tr id="Targeting inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major unmet need. Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2LD) selectively increases regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers in patients with coronary artery disease. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor analyses and show that IL-2LD clonally expands effector Treg cells in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The clonally expanded Treg cells upregulate key immunosuppressive and metabolic pathways and show an increased number of predicted ligand–receptor interactions. These Treg cells also display similar predicted antigen specificities, which cluster with published sequences specific to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. By tracking the T cell receptors of single cells over time, we identify an inflammatory polarization of the T cell compartment after myocardial infarction, which is restrained by IL-2LD. We identify BACH2 as a repressor of the Treg effector program. However, BACH2-mediated regulation is bypassed with IL-2LD. Overall, these results lend insight into the IL-2-driven clonal expansion program in human Treg cells, with important therapeutic implications for patients with cardiovascular and other immune-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the TEC family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, including B lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Selective BTK inhibitors (BTKi) have shown efficacy in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we investigated the role of BTK in human and mouse myeloid cells in in vitro and in vivo studies. Methods We evaluated i) the impact of the BTK inhibitor (BTKi) evobrutinib on monocyte markers for activation, costimulation, adhesion and phagocytosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from healthy and MS subjects; ii) the therapeutic effects and the action of evobrutinib on myeloid cell phenotype in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS; iii) the contribution of BTK in short-lived vs. long-lived myeloid cells to EAE expression via experiments with double transgenic mice allowing inducible inactivation of BTK in CX3CR1 expressing cells. Results We report that BTKi supported monocyte expression of VLA4/CD49d, an integrin directing immune cell migration towards the central nervous system, and CD163, a well-known scavenger receptor involved in removal of myelin debris, in samples from healthy subjects. This effect was maintained under distinct inflammatory settings and replicated with PBMC of MS subjects. Therapeutic intervention with evobrutinib ameliorated EAE severity and was associated with a significant modest decrease in the frequency of CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory macrophages. However, conditional BTK deletion in short-lived or long-lived CX3CR1-positive cells did not reduce EAE severity. Discussion This functional evidence questions the real contribution of BTK expressing myeloid cells to experimental MS.">

        <tr id="Background Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play a central role in atherosclerosis by undergoing phenotypic modulation from a quiescent, contractile state to a range of synthetic phenotypes, including fibroblast-like, macrophage-like, and lipid-laden foam cell–like states. However, a comprehensive multimodal characterization and understanding of the transcriptional programs driving these transitions remain incomplete. Methods To comprehensively define the phenotypic diversity of VSMCs during atherosclerosis progression, we performed in-depth profiling using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing in a VSMC lineage-tracing atherosclerotic mouse model. Insights from these datasets guided the design of targeted in vitro experiments to investigate candidate regulatory mechanisms. Results Single-cell multi-omics revealed extensive cellular heterogeneity within atherosclerotic plaques, including a rare population of VSMC-derived macrophage-like cells, whose presence was confirmed by histological analysis. These studies also identified a substantial population of VSMC-derived foam cells, comprising approximately 70% of all foam cells in the lesions. These cells exhibited activation of gene programs associated with lipid metabolism, proliferation, and tumor-like features. The transcription factor Bhlhe40 emerged as a key regulator of this phenotypic transition, with elevated expression in VSMC-derived foam cells during disease progression. Functional knockdown of Bhlhe40 suppressed VSMC phenotypic switching and foam cell characteristics, underscoring its potential role as a driver of VSMC modulation. Conclusions These findings advance our understanding of VSMC phenotypic modulation in atherosclerosis and highlight Bhlhe40 as a key regulator of this process. Elucidating the mechanisms governing VSMC plasticity may offer new therapeutic opportunities to reduce cardiovascular risk by targeting disease-driving cellular transitions.">

        <tr id="Immune responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) following influenza A virus (IAV) infection can influence disease severity, and subsequently inflammation and lung tissue damage in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). This study investigated the role of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a key pattern recognition receptor that senses viral RNA and triggers antiviral and proinflammatory signaling to activate immune responses, in specifically shaping URT and LRT immune responses to IAV infection. Wild type C57Bl/6 and TLR7 knockout (TLR7 KO) mice were infected with the H3N2 IAV strain Hk-X31, and key immune responses in the nasal tissue (URT) and lower airways and lung tissue (LRT) measured after acute infection. We found reduced body weight loss, and increased type II/III interferons and proinflammatory cytokines in the URT of TLR7 KO mice; while LRT inflammation was reduced. TLR7 was essential for activating immune responses in the LRT but played a more selective role in the URT, primarily influencing monocytes, pDCs and B cells. Our data suggest that TLR7 plays a critical role in the transition of inflammation from the URT to the LRT during IAV infection, making it a promising therapeutic target to modulate disease severity.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a heterogeneous infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The distinctive features of COVID-19 infection encompass a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe illness involving diverse underlying pathophysiological processes such as hyperinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic microangiopathies, and multiple organ failure. However, the host responses to COVID-19, including systemic inflammation and immunity against SARS-CoV-2, remain largely undefined across different disease states. Here, we performed global transcriptome profiling of 228 peripheral blood samples of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations and subsequent clustering using an unsupervised algorithm. We identified various transcriptomic clusters and globally dysregulated immune-related pathways, leading to distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles in severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This underscores the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release. Additionally, our results reveal variances in circulating cell populations and the activation of apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients with diverse clinical presentations offers valuable insights into molecular mechanisms and may inform clinical decisions on anti-inflammatory therapies.

        <tr id="Long‐term consequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are unknown since recovered individuals can experience symptoms and latent viral reactivation for months. Indeed, acute post‐infection sequelae have also been observed in other respiratory viral infections, including influenza. To characterize post‐COVID‐19 and post‐influenza induced alterations to the cellular immunome, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients 3 months after recovery from COVID‐19 (n = 93) or influenza (n = 25), and from pre‐pandemic healthy controls (n = 25). PBMCs were characterized using a 40‐plex mass cytometry panel. Principal component analysis (PCA), classification models, and K‐means clustering were subsequently applied. PCA identified distinct immune profiles between cohorts, with both post‐COVID and post‐flu patients displaying an altered chemokine receptor expression compared to pre‐pandemic healthy controls. These alterations were more prominent in post‐COVID patients since they exhibited highly increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6 by various lymphoid populations, while post‐influenza patients mainly showed a decrease in CCR4 expression by naïve T cells, monocytes, and conventional dendritic cells. Classification models using immunophenotyping data confirm the three groups, while K‐means clustering revealed two subgroups among post‐COVID patients, with younger patients showing more pronounced immune alterations in the chemokine receptor profile, independently of long COVID symptoms. In conclusion, post‐COVID and post‐influenza patients exhibit distinct and unique persistent immune alterations. Understanding these altered immune profiles can guide targeted therapies for post‐COVID syndrome and highlight differences in immune recovery from various respiratory infections.">

        <tr id="Immune response to infection or vaccination is compromised with age. We aimed to examine associations between immune senescence, T and B cell clonal diversity and immunoglobulin G secretion in response to immune challenge in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from people of different chronological ages. We isolated PBMC from 49 individuals categorised into < 35 years and > 60 years age groups. Cells were then challenged with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or vehicle and IMMAX score was calculated for each sample from flow cytometry. Antibody response was assessed using the proxy of IgG secretion and T cell receptor and immunoglobulin framework region recombination was determined by clonality studies. We observed that individuals aged > 60 years demonstrated a higher immune ‘age’ as calculated by IMMAX score (0.75 compared with 0.48 for individuals aged < 35 years; p = < 0.0001). Immune age negatively correlated with IgG responsivity in older individuals with recent prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (b = -0.01; p = 0.05). Higher immune age was also negatively correlated with TCR Vd + Jd receptor diversity regardless of immune challenge (b = -0.02; p = < 0.0001 and b = -0.02; r2 = 0.0.35; p = < 0.0001 for control and exposed samples respectively). Our data demonstrate that PBMC samples from older people display a higher cellular immune age and attenuation of immune response. This suggests that future treatments targeting cellular ageing of immune cells may be a useful avenue for investigation to improve immune function in older people.

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) is a severe condition that may follow sepsis and is characterized by ongoing inflammation and immune suppression, diminishing quality of life and potentially causing death. The role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in PICS, despite their association with thrombopoiesis, is not well understood. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile MKs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from 11 patients, including six with PICS, five with sepsis, and five healthy controls, to determine the diversity and molecular signatures of the MKs. Five subgroups of MKs are identified (MK1-MK5), and their proportions vary across the groups. MK1 and MK2 are predominant in PICS. Gene Ontology analysis shows that genes related to antigen processing and presentation and IL-17 signaling are enriched in MK1, whereas genes associated with platelet degranulation and neutrophil activation are enriched in MK2. Moreover, the expression level of CCL5 is markedly increased in MKs. Ligand-receptor analysis reveals dynamic interactions among MKs and T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages, suggesting a broad role of MKs in immune homeostasis. In PICS model mice, MKs regulate systemic inflammation by reducing the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A and promoting lung tissue repair. Our findings establish MKs as essential components of the immune system in PICS and provide new insights into their potential as therapeutic targets for post-sepsis immune dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a prevalent condition whose recurrence leads to multiple adverse effects. Previous studies on INS pathogenesis primarily focused on immune dysregulation, particularly T-cell changes and their correlation with cytokine shifts. Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell dysfunction also plays a role. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effective treatment strategies remains incomplete. Methods This study investigates changes in gene expressions and cellular interactions of immune cells at a single-cell level using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). And subsequently validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. Results We identified seven main clusters using unsupervised clustering of 103,213 high-quality single cells. Through unsupervised clustering, patient-specific T cells (IFI44L + CD4 + T cells) that exhibited a pronounced elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is identified. Activation of ISGs and interferon (IFN)-related pathways are also observed in other clusters. Specifically, this study demonstrates that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role by promoting the interaction between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and receptors on B cells. This interaction triggers the release of autoantibodies, thereby initiating INS pathogenesis. Furthermore, telitacicept has shown efficacy in treating pediatric patients with frequent relapse NS(FRNS). Conclusions Overall, our findings underscore the role of interferon and its related pathways in INS pathogenesis, providing novel therapeutic interventions for NS.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has underscored the need to understand the virus’s evolution due to its global health impact. This study employed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to analyze gene expression differences across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We used publicly available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with IDs GSE157103, GSE171110, GSE189039, and GSE201530, which contain RNA-Seq data extracted from white blood cells, whole blood, or PBMCs of individuals infected with the Original Wuhan variant (both hospitalized and non-hospitalized), the French variant (hospitalized), the Beta variant (hospitalized), and the Omicron variant (moderate and mild cases), along with COVID-negative controls. Our first objective was to examine differences in gene expression dynamics using Generalized Linear Models with Quasi-Likelihood F-tests and the Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (GLMQL-MAS) technique, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. Our second objective was to employ Cross-MAS to identify a robust set of genes indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the variant and to assess their classification performance. GO and pathway analyses revealed a significant evolutionary shift in how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host. Early variants such as the Original Wuhan and French cases primarily affected pathways related to viral replication, including Eukaryotic Translation Elongation and Viral mRNA Translation. In contrast, later variants like Beta and Omicron showed a strategic shift toward modulating and evading the host immune response, engaging immune-related pathways such as Interferon Alpha/Beta signaling and Cytokine signaling in the immune system. To evaluate the classification potential of the identified genes, we tested them on held-out datasets GSE152418, PMC8202013, GSE161731, and GSE166190, which contain RNA-Seq data from whole blood or PBMCs of COVID-positive and healthy individuals. Using top-ranked genes such as IFI27, CDC20, RRM2, HJURP, and CDC45 in linear models including logistic regression and linear SVM, we achieved 97.31% accuracy, with precision and recall rates of 0.97 and 0.99, respectively. These signatures also achieved perfect classification (100% accuracy, precision, and recall) in two additional datasets: GSE294888, which includes blood-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (DC2s) stimulated with Delta or Omicron variants, and GSE239595, which features Omicron-infected nasopharyngeal tissue. These findings demonstrate the potential of transcriptomic signatures for variant-agnostic COVID-19 detection and provide a foundation for flexible diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in response to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="In this comprehensive review, we delve into the significant body of research on single-cell transcriptomics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to understand neurological diseases with autoimmune, neurodegenerative, infectious, or oncogenic origins. We thoroughly examine all published studies in these areas, with a particular focus on multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. For these diseases, we review findings related to immune cells that infiltrate the brain, based on postmortem brain tissue analyses and include CSF cytometry findings. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), and single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) are increasingly vital tools for studying CSF to understand various aspects of neurological diseases. These advanced techniques allow researchers to explore the etiopathogenesis of these conditions by identifying the roles and interactions of different immune cells. scRNA-seq provides detailed insights into the gene expression profiles of individual cells, revealing how specific cell types contribute to disease progression. scTCR-seq and scBCR-seq enable the study of clonal expansion in T and B cells, respectively, and facilitate antigen prediction, helping to uncover the nature of antigens that trigger adaptive immune responses. By integrating these technologies, scientists can define new therapeutic targets and categorize patients, leading to more personalized and effective treatments. This review highlights the promising advancements and addresses the current limitations of single-cell transcriptomics in the context of CSF and neurological diseases, setting the stage for future breakthroughs.">

The mutants showed delayed replication and reduced cytopathic effects in vitro. In vivo, infected hamsters exhibited less weight loss, lower viral loads, and reduced inflammation, indicating attenuated pathogenicity. Histological analysis confirmed milder airway damage. Additionally, PBM-deficient viruses had impaired interactions with tight junction proteins like ZO-1, a PDZ-containing protein essential for epithelial integrity. Although the PBM played a key role in airway pathology, its impact on neuroinvasion was minimal during the acute phase of infection. Thus, the E protein PBM plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2’s fitness, virulence, and pathogenicity, through the disruption of cell junctions and inflammation, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target.

        <tr id="Atherosclerosis (AS), the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases, is a chronic inflammatory disorder involving lipid metabolism, immune dysregulation, and cell death. Pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory programmed cell death, is implicated in AS progression, yet its molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential remain incompletely understood. A multi-omics framework integrating transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to identify and prioritize pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in AS. Functional enrichment, immune infiltration profiling, and protein–protein interaction network analyses were conducted. Experimental validation was conducted using in vitro and in vivo models. Thirty-six PRGs were identified, with TREM2, TNF, MMP9, IL1B, and CASP1 emerging as key regulators of pyroptosis and inflammation. These PRGs demonstrated robust diagnostic potential in internal and external datasets. Immune infiltration analysis stratified AS patients into subtypes, with Cluster 2 characterized by elevated macrophage pyroptosis and a pro-inflammatory immune microenvironment. Single-cell analysis confirmed TREM2 upregulation in macrophages and monocytes, linking it to immune activation and plaque instability. Experimental validation revealed TREM2’s dual role in promoting macrophage lipid accumulation and pyroptosis. This study establishes PRGs, particularly TREM2, as critical modulators of AS progression. These findings enhance our understanding of pyroptosis in AS and provide a framework for developing PRG-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a major health emergency since its emergence in late 2019. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of COVID-19, leading to severe illness, i.e. coagulopathy, multi-organ failure. FX06, a fibrin-derived peptide naturally occurring in the human body, formerly known as Bβ15-42, is a promising therapeutic candidate for endothelial complications like capillary leakage in COVID-19 and other forms of acute respiratory disorders. The aim of this project is to investigate whether FX06 can attenuate COVID-19 cytokine-triggered inflammatory processes in vitro. Methods To mimic the inflammatory status of COVID-19, a human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell line (ECs) – HULEC-5a, was treated with a cytokine cocktail comprised of ten different cytokines or chemokines at concentrations found in serum profiles of COVID-19 patients with severe illness, further referred to as the severe cytokine cocktail. ECs were treated with the severe cytokine cocktail for 24 h, in the absence or presence of FX06 for 2 h. Results The severe cytokine cocktail enhanced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-endothelial adhesion and monolayer transmigration. This deleterious effect was significantly reduced by FX06. FX06 was also shown to mitigate the cytotoxic activity of allogeneic CD8+ T cells, which increased upon cytokine treatment. FX06 restored continuous vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin/CD144 distribution on the EC surface and reversed morphological changes mediated by the severe cytokine cocktail, such as the elongation of F-actin stress fibers. FX06 reduced capillary-like structure formation of the severe cytokine cocktail treated-ECs, indicating FX06 down-regulated the pro-inflammatory angiogenic activity caused by the severe cytokine cocktail. Additionally, FX06 might assist in maintaining the normal barrier function of ECs by altering the surface expression of Syndecan-1 (SDC1/CD138). Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses demonstrated that FX06 in the presence of the severe cytokine cocktail inactivated RhoGTPase, which was confirmed by western blotting that FX06 attenuated RhoA, a member of RhoGTPase, enhanced by the severe cytokine cocktail and down-regulated the expression of the phosphorylated downstream protein, ROCK1. Conclusion Overall, FX06 shows promising potential in normalizing ECs and reducing vascular leakage to protect the endothelium against the proinflammatory effect of COVID-19-triggered cytokines.">

        <tr id="Abstract Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression. Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.">

        <tr id="The Global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 was initiated by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In addition to conventional pulmonary lesions, a range of neurological injury symptoms have been identified in clinical practice, but the aetiology of neurological disorders linked to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection remains poorly understood. Syrian hamsters, which are highly susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, exhibit a disease phenotype similar to that observed in human COVID‐19 patients. In this study, a hamster model of COVID‐19 infection was used to analyze molecular changes in different tissues at various time points post infection with distinct strains using proteomic and phosphoproteomic approaches. Multi‐omics analysis showed that SARS‐COV‐2 infection triggers sustained downregulation of the abundance and phosphorylation levels of neuronal and synapse‐associated proteins in the brain, suggesting that neuronal damage persists even during the recovery period. Additionally, infections with SARS‐CoV‐2 may contribute to the onset of long‐term symptoms of COVID‐19 by impacting energy metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic transmission pathways. This study provides a comprehensive molecular profile of hamsters infected with different SARS‐CoV‐2 strains in different tissues, offering foundational insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) triggers a dynamic immune response involving macrophages, However, the functional heterogeneity of these cells and the mechanisms through which they promote repair remain unclear. Although the neuropeptide CGRP has been shown to modulate macrophage phenotypes in other pathological contexts, its role in ICH recovery and white matter repair remains unexplored. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45 + cells from ICH mice (GSE167593 and GSE230414 datasets) identified macrophage subsets. Flow cytometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), behavioral assays, and immunofluorescence validated macrophage dynamics and white matter (WM) integrity. Bone marrow and skull analyses traced macrophage origins. The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was tested via intraperitoneal administration in ICH mice, with outcomes assessed through transcriptomics, ultrastructural imaging, and functional recovery. Results scRNA-seq revealed sustained accumulation of THBS1 + macrophages post-ICH, correlating with WM repair and neurological recovery. These macrophages exhibited pro-repair and remyelination gene signatures (e.g., Arg1, Tgm2). Bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, particularly skull-resident populations, served as the primary source of THBS1 + macrophages. CGRP, elevated in meninges and bone marrow post-ICH, drove macrophage polarization toward THBS + phenotypes. CGRP administration expanded THBS1-positive macrophages in the bone marrow and brain, improving WM integrity (reduced radial diffusivity, higher fractional anisotropy) and sensorimotor function. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed enhanced myelin regeneration (lower g-ratio) in CGRP-treated mice. Conclusions This study identifies a neuroimmune axis wherein CGRP promotes bone marrow-derived THBS1 + macrophages to facilitate WM repair and functional recovery after ICH. Targeting CGRP-macrophage signaling offers a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery in hemorrhagic brain injury.

Although the pathogenesis of neurological COVID-19 still remains unclear, some studies have discussed the potential association between tissue injury and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and/or immune imbalance. These two mechanisms are non-mutually exclusive; however, exacerbated inflammatory-response-induced neurological damage appears to be more aligned with COVID-19 pathogenesis, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication in the CNS remains widely discussed. Herein, we dissect this last issue, highlighting some evidence on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, as well as discussing gaps that should be addressed for a better understanding of its potential neurotropism, specifically in the CNS. Finally, we propose some deeper reflections on the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic potential.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological issues, including cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19, is also a risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation in COVID-19 patients, and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD. SARS-CoV-2 also induces cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We hypothesized that eNOS deficiency would worsen neuroinflammation, senescence, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and hypercoagulability in eNOS-deficient mice. Six-month-old eNOS+/− (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and wild-type (WT) male mice were infected with mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2. Mice were evaluated for weight loss, viral load, and markers of inflammation and senescence 3 days post-infection. eNOS+/− mice showed more weight loss (~15%) compared to WT mice (~5%) and increased inflammatory markers (Ccl2, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, IL-1β, and IL-6) and senescence markers (p53 and p21). They also exhibited higher microglial activation (Iba1) and increased plasma coagulation and BBB permeability, despite comparable lung viral loads and absence of virus in the brain. This is the first experimental evidence demonstrating that eNOS deficiency exacerbates SARS-CoV-2-induced morbidity, neuroinflammation, and brain senescence, linking eNOS to COVID-19-related neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Background Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a significant threat to human health. The virus causes potentially fatal disease of the central nervous system (CNS), for which no treatments are available. TBEV infected individuals display a wide spectrum of neuronal disease, the determinants of which are undefined. Changes to host metabolism and virus-induced immunity have been postulated to contribute to the neuronal damage observed in infected individuals. In this study, we evaluated the cytokine, chemokine, and metabolic alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of symptomatic patients infected with TBEV presenting with meningitis or encephalitis. Our aim was to investigate the host immune and metabolic responses associated with specific TBEV infectious outcomes. Methods CSF samples of patients with meningitis (n = 27) or encephalitis (n = 25) were obtained upon consent from individuals hospitalised with confirmed TBEV infection in Brno. CSF from uninfected control patients was also collected for comparison (n = 12). A multiplex bead-based system was used to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Untargeted metabolomics followed by bioinformatics and integrative omics were used to profile the levels of metabolites in the CSF. Human motor neurons (hMNs) were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and infected with the highly pathogenic TBEV-Hypr strain to profile the role(s) of identified metabolites during the virus lifecycle. Virus infection was quantified via plaque assay. Results Significant differences in proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-α2, TSLP, IL-1α, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-12p40, IL-15, and IL-18) and chemokines (IL-8, CCL20, and CXCL11) were detected between neurological-TBEV and control patients. A total of 32 CSF metabolites differed in TBE patients with meningitis and encephalitis. CSF S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP1) and Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) levels were 2.4-fold (range ≥ 2.3-≥3.2) higher in encephalitis patients compared to the meningitis group. CSF urocanic acid levels were significantly lower in patients with encephalitis compared to those with meningitis (p = 0.012209). Follow-up analyses showed fluctuations in the levels of O-phosphoethanolamine, succinic acid, and L-proline in the encephalitis group, and pyruvic acid in the meningitis group. TBEV-infection of hMNs increased the production of SAM, FBP1 and PEP in a time-dependent manner. Depletion of the metabolites with characterised pharmacological inhibitors led to a concentration-dependent attenuation of virus growth, validating the identified changes as key mediators of TBEV infection. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the neurological disease outcome of TBEV infection is associated with specific and dynamic metabolic signatures in the cerebrospinal fluid. We describe a new in vitro model for in-depth studies of TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis, in which the depletion of identified metabolites limits virus infection. Collectively, this reveals new biomarkers that can differentiate and predict TBEV-associated neurological disease. Additionally, we have identified novel therapeutic targets with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and deepen our understanding of TBEV pathogenesis.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the profound and lasting impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system. Beyond acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent, disrupting immune homeostasis and contributing to persistent inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, neuropathy, and mood disturbances. These are linked to immune dysregulation involving cytokine imbalance, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, glial activation, and T-cell exhaustion. Key biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NFL) correlate with disease severity and chronicity. This narrative review examines the immunopathological mechanisms underpinning the neurological sequelae of long COVID, focusing on neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and molecular mimicry. We also assess the role of viral variants in shaping neuroimmune outcomes and explore emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including biomarker-guided and immune-targeted interventions. By delineating how SARS-CoV-2 reshapes neuroimmune interactions, this review aims to support the development of precision-based diagnostics and targeted therapies for long COVID-related neurological dysfunction. Emerging approaches include immune-modulatory agents (e.g., anti-IL-6), neuroprotective drugs, and strategies for repurposing antiviral or anti-inflammatory compounds in neuro-COVID. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities, personalized therapies guided by biomarkers and patient-specific immune profiles may be essential. Advancements in vaccine technologies and targeted biologics may also hold promise for prevention and disease modification. Finally, continued interdisciplinary research is needed to clarify the complex virus–immune–brain axis in long COVID and inform effective clinical management.">

        <tr id="The ovary is one of the first organs to exhibit signs of aging, characterized by reduced tissue function, chronic inflammation, and fibrosis. Multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs), formed by macrophage fusion, typically occur in chronic immune pathologies, including infectious and non-infectious granulomas and the foreign body response, but are also observed in the aging ovary. The function and consequence of ovarian MNGCs remain unknown as their biological activity is highly context-dependent, and their large size has limited their isolation and analysis through technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing. In this study, we define ovarian MNGCs through a deep analysis of their presence across age and species using advanced imaging technologies as well as their unique transcriptome using laser capture microdissection. MNGCs form complex interconnected networks that increase with age in both mouse and nonhuman primate ovaries. MNGCs are characterized by high Gpnmb expression, a putative marker of ovarian and non-ovarian MNGCs. Pathway analysis highlighted functions in apoptotic cell clearance, lipid metabolism, proteolysis, immune processes, and increased oxidative phosphorylation and antioxidant activity. Thus, MNGCs have signatures related to degradative processes, immune function, and high metabolic activity. These processes were enriched in MNGCs compared to primary ovarian macrophages, suggesting discrete functionality. MNGCs express CD4 and colocalize with T-cells, which were enriched in regions of MNGCs, indicative of a close interaction between these immune cell types. These findings implicate MNGCs in modulation of the ovarian immune landscape during aging given their high penetrance and unique molecular signature that supports degradative and immune functions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Growing evidence links immune dysfunction, notably impaired IFNγ production, to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), but understanding of the immune phenotype in CPA patients remains limited. Methods To investigate this, we recruited 25 CPA patients and 25 controls with bronchiectasis, isolating immune cells from peripheral blood for detailed flow cytometric phenotyping at resting state and after ex vivo stimulation with the TLR2/Dectin-1 agonist Zymosan. Results CPA patients exhibited pronounced neutrophilia and a reduced frequency of conventional dendritic cell (DC) subsets at baseline compared to bronchiectasis controls. Post-stimulation, DC and monocyte subsets in CPA patients showed significantly lower expression of activation markers. Notably, cDC1s displayed reduced IL-12p40, TNFα, and CD86 expression. CPA patients with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had significantly higher frequencies of activated cDC1s. Machine learning analysis validated these immunological parameters as predictive of CPA status. Conclusion Our findings suggest that immune dysfunction in CPA involves DC and monocyte impairments, potentially contributing to IFNγ deficiency through reduced IL-12 production and co-stimulatory capacity in cDC1s. These results also hint at the presence of innate immune memory in CPA patients with prior TB. Our study advances understanding of the immune dysfunction underlying CPA.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the world with a major public health problem, long COVID (LC), which is estimated to affect over 400 million people worldwide. Many unknowns remain regarding the mechanisms involved in LC. We investigated the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and IFN-γ responses on the development of LC and its various phenotypes. We studied a cohort of 137 convalescents following predominantly mild COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave (2020) and up to one-year post-infection. We found 45% of LC cases that were associated with a greater number and duration of acute-phase symptoms. Cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal symptoms in the acute phase were associated to protection against LC development, while pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, musculoskeletal and other symptoms were associated with increased risk of LC development. Regarding LC phenotypes, we observed risk associations and potentially deleterious effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for LC symptoms classified as general or other. In contrast, for vital organ-related LC symptoms, we found only protective associations, particularly for cardiovascular symptoms, which indeed had a low prevalence in LC (16%). Collectively, our data suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies play a protective role against vital organ-related LC symptoms, especially cardiovascular symptoms, but are insufficient in preventing or limiting other highly prevalent LC symptoms, such as neurological, psychiatric and pulmonary.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced excessive inflammatory response is a key contributor to pathology in respiratory viral infections. However, the underlying mechanisms by which viral infection provokes intense inflammatory reaction and how sustained inflammation leads to tissue damage are not fully understood. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as an example, our research demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce PANoptosis in bystander cells, contributing to the persistence of inflammatory responses. Specifically, the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in infected cells leads to the secretion of 2'3'cGMP-AMP, TNF-α, and IFN-β. These molecules activate STING-induced autophagy-mediated ADAR1 degradation, resulting in the accumulation of Z-nucleic acid, which subsequently triggers ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis in bystander cells. Additionally, inhibiting the cGAS pathway or knocking out STING effectively reduces PANoptosis and alleviates the pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus infection in mouse models. Overall, our findings reveal the unexpected role of PANoptosis in bystander cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection as a mechanism driving pathological damage and persistent inflammatory responses. Targeting this process may offer a promising strategy to mitigate tissue damage in COVID-19 as well as other viral infections and inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by β-amyloid (βA) accumulation, neuroinflammation, excessive synaptic pruning, and cognitive decline. Despite extensive research, effective treatments remain elusive. Here, we identify potassium channel-interacting protein 3 (KChIP3) as a key driver of AD pathology using the 5XFAD mouse model. KChIP3 levels were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice, correlating with βA burden and neuroinflammation. This upregulation was triggered by inflammatory signaling via the NLRP3 inflammasome and Caspase-1 activation. Notably, genetic deletion of KChIP3 (5XFAD/KChIP3−/−) markedly reduced βA plaque deposition, pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive gliosis, and expression of inflammation-related proteins (APO, CLU, MDK). Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed restored synaptic markers (CD47, CD200, CACNB4, GDA) and a shift of the disease-associated microglial (DAM-1) phenotype. Mechanistically, we propose that KChIP3 amplifies AD pathology through two key mechanisms: (1) sustaining neuroinflammation by upregulating pro-inflammatory genes and (2) impairing synaptic integrity by repressing genes critical for neuronal function. Consistently, KChIP3 deletion enhanced dendritic complexity, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive performance in 5XFAD mice. These findings position KChIP3 as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction in AD and highlight its potential as a biomarker for disease progression.

        <tr id="Aims Macrophage-mediated inflammatory response plays a pivotal role in the pathological process of myocardial infarction (MI). Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) shed light on the differentiation and function of macrophage subsets post-MI, it failed to capture protein-level changes, limiting comprehensive assessment. Methods To address this limitation, first, we analyzed the scRNA-seq data from ArrayExpress, after comprehensive quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and clustering analyses, macrophage subsets were systematically classified and annotated using established computational pipelines. Then, these computational classifications were validated through rigorous animal experiments. Finally, we integrated proteomic data from our experimental model and scRNA-seq to analyze the effect of protein modification changes in macrophage subsets on prognosis post-MI. Results A total of seven macrophage clusters were identified and annotated, including Spp1hiMac, MHCIIhiMac, Ltc4shiMac, Lyve1hiMac, DcnhiMac, Ly6c1hiMono and Stmn1hiMac. Spp1hiMac and Ltc4shiMac, linked to leukocyte migration and chemotaxis, peaked at 3 days. MHCIIhiMac and and DcnhiMac, involved in antigen processing and presentation and collagen fibril organization, peaked at 7 days. Lyve1hiMac reduced on days 3 and 7, and by day 28 returned to baseline levels. By integrating scRNA-seq and proteomics, there 78, 126, and 64 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in macrophages were obtained at 3, 7 and 28 days, respectively. At 3 days, DEPs were linked to inflammation, protein processing and maturation. At 7 days, DEPs were enriched in regulation of actin filament organization and cellular response to interferon-gamma. At 28 days, DEPs exhibited inhibitory effects on inflammation, cell apoptosis and migration. The post-translational modifications (PTMs) of DEPs involved phosphorylation, acetylation and lactylation, and these DEPs are mainly associated with inflammation, fibrosis and cytoskeletal organization, including Marcks, Anxa2, Vim, Dcn, Tpm3 and so on. Conclusion By integrating scRNAseq and proteomics data, this study provides a comprehensive overview of heterogeneity and dynamic protein level changes of macrophages post-MI, and characterizes the PTMs in macrophages, and lays the groundwork for developing targeted interventions tailored to specific cell types and time points post-MI.

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes are central mediators of neuroinflammation in several neurodegenerative diseases. Their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. This study aimed to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes were cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a microfluidic coculture platform. This platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of distinct microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 h. Glial activation and interactions were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. LPS stimulation of cocultures induced lower secretion of several inflammatory mediators, suggesting dampening of microglial inflammatory responses when cocultured with astrocytes. Notably, inflammatory interaction between glial cells was demonstrated by increased level of IL-10 after TNF-α/IL-1β stimulation in cocultures compared with monocultures. The microfluidic coculture platform enabled the parallel study of microglial migration, glial activation and phagocytic function, thereby facilitating the investigation of glial responses within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Furthermore, glial inflammatory responses and interactions were demonstrated in the controlled microenvironments of the microfluidic coculture platform. The inflammatory coculture environment was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate inflammatory interaction between iPSC-derived microglia and astrocytes via reciprocal molecular signaling. Importantly, the microfluidic coculture platform established in this study provides a more functional and advanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.

        <tr id="COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), stands as one of the most severe pandemics the world has ever faced in recent times. SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of symptoms, varying from severe manifestations to mild cases and even asymptomatic carriers. This diversity stems from a multitude of factors, including genetic predisposition, viral variants, and immune status. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune system engages pattern recognition receptors, setting off a series of intricate signalling cascades. These cascades culminate in the activation of innate immune responses, including induction of type I and type III interferons. The emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose challenges to the innate immune system defense. Therefore, investigating the innate immune response is crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophoshate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, a critical innate immune mechanism, represents a promising target for intervention at multiple stages to reduce the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review explores innate immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other immune responses critical for SARS-CoV-2 defence. As part of the therapeutic approach, we extend our review to highlight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as emerging and effective therapeutics for controlling SARS-CoV-2 by targeting different stages of the innate immune system. A diverse range of mAbs has been explored to address specific targets within the innate immune pathways. A deep understanding of innate immunity and targeted monoclonal therapeutics will be instrumental in combating viruses and their variants, laying the foundation for enhanced treatment and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="In the last 2 years, there has been an increasing concern that SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a marker of undiagnosed cancers. A potential connection between COVID-19/long COVID and malignant transformation/cancer progression was reported in a number of studies. It is, however, unclear if the virus itself can cause malignant transformation or if it has a potential to support malignant processes in human body. We analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs collected from individuals infected with Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and conducted in vitro studies using BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells. Here we report that Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein induce activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription complex in infected cells. This effect is achieved through conversion of cellular 2-oxoglutarate into 2-hydroxy-glutarate, which most likely blocks the activity of HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylation. As such, it leads to activation of HIF-1, which triggers production of transforming growth factor–β type 1 (TGF-β). TGF-β induces expression of immune checkpoint proteins, such as galectin-9, programmed death-ligand 1, and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme, which is involved in production of immunosuppressive amino acid called L-kynurenine. These immune checkpoint pathways were capable of suppressing both helper and cytotoxic activities of T lymphocytes and, as such, could potentially support malignant processes in infected tissues.">

        <tr id="The autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc) presents with multiple organ manifestations that often complicate management strategies. To explore variations in immune cell subsets and their link to clinical heterogeneity, here we perform single-cell profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 21 SSc patients who never received immunosuppressive therapy. We identify a subset of EGR1+ CD14+ monocytes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This subset activates NF-kB signaling and differentiates into tissue-damaging macrophages, which accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, we identify a CD8+ T cell subset with type II interferon signature in the peripheral blood and the lung tissue of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD), suggesting that chemokine-driven migration of these cells contributes to ILD progression. Thus, our single-cell analysis reveals distinct immune cell abnormalities associated with clinical organ manifestations, providing insights into tailored treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial arteries, accompanied by the formation of fragile collateral vessels, ultimately leading to ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Immune dysregulation, particularly involving T cell abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MMD; however, their precise relationship remains unclear. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with MMD and healthy controls were analyzed using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and transcriptomic profiling. Additionally, clinical characteristics and neuroimaging data were collected to perform integrated correlation analyses with immune profiling data. Results Patients with MMD exhibited aberrant T cell activation and altered subset distribution, accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Increased oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress were observed in T cells, along with disease-specific downregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1 and ICOS. Conclusions This study highlights the critical involvement of immune activation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of MMD, providing novel insights into disease mechanisms and identifying immunometabolic pathways as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

        <tr id="Background In late 2022, Beijing, China saw a large-scale BF.7 Omicron variant breakthrough infection. However, the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on elderly breakthrough-infected patients’ antibodies and immune cells response was unclear. Methods We recruited 329 inpatients over 65 with BF.7 breakthrough infections. We analyzed the link between vaccination and survival in 67 sampled patients, investigating changes in antibody levels, cytokine profiles, as well as immune phenotypes. Results Experiments revealed that while vaccination could raise antibody levels in the elderly, it showed no significant neutralizing activity against the emerging COVID-19 variant XBB. Flow cytometry showed vaccination increased the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Moreover, we found that elevated frequencies of CD4+ Tsens cells were associated with reduced antigen-specific CD4+ T cell activation, diminished IL-2 production, and lower proportions of Tfh cells, which ultimately leading to impaired neutralizing antibody production, particularly against new emerging variants. Conclusions We found the immunological efficacy of inactivated vaccines in elderly patients is influenced by the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Future elderly vaccination strategies need optimization in dose number and timing, and future vaccine design should aim to minimize the generation of CD4+ senescent T cells.

        <tr id="Different functional T lymphocytes play important roles in the progression of IAV infection, including proliferation, recruitment, and effector activity. However, the immune changes of T cells during IAV infection are unclear, and the related targets are still to be explored. In this study, we used a multi-omics approach combining transcriptome and single-cell transcriptome analysis to identify TXN as a key target gene and elucidate its close association with T-cell proliferation. From these data, we identified 10 key differential genes through a combination of differential analysis, WGCNA, and Friends analysis and further identified that only TXN and S100A6 co-existed in the highly variable genes of proliferative T cells. Because TXN exhibits highly specific high expression in proliferative T cells, we focused on its related research and ultimately identified it as a target gene for IAV infection. Reports have suggested that simultaneous inhibition of the GSH and TXN pathways can effectively trigger cell death. This proves our hypothesis about a new direction of T cell death in IAV infection. Additionally, we found that T cell development after IAV infection was regulated and altered, but this study did not clearly explain whether it was negative regulation. In summary, we have identified TXN as a target gene involved in T cell proliferation during IAV infection, and we suggest that its expression may be associated with non-apoptotic forms of T cell death.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toxoplasma gondii is a foodborne intracellular parasite that chronically infects the brain. Although T. gondii infection elicits a protective immune response, the nature of the monocyte response in the immediate vicinity of parasites during initial brain infection is not well understood. By infecting mice with T. gondii and comparing areas of the brain containing or not containing parasites, we found an increase in CCR2+ monocytes, IBA1+ myeloid cells, GFAP+ astrocytes, and CD68+ signal near parasites in the brain, indicating immune cell infiltration and phagolysosomal activation in response to the infection. CCR2+CD68+ monocytes were specifically increased near tachyzoites with minimal localization of these cells near cysts in the brain. This monocyte response was also detected near parasite-interacted cells, identified using T. gondii parasites that inject Cre recombinase into “interacted” cells of Ai6 CCR2RFP/+ mice, enabling us to track these events in vivo. The chemokine CCL2 and its transcription factor NF-κB were also upregulated surrounding parasites in the brain; however, the T. gondii effector protein GRA15, which sustains NF-κB activation in infected cells, was not required for CCL2 production, NF-κB activation, or myeloid cell recruitment to parasites in the brain. In contrast, active T. gondii replication played a more significant role, as CCR2+ monocytes were recruited to replication-competent but not replication-deficient T. gondii delivered via intracranial injection into mice. These findings provide novel insights into the drivers of immune cell mobilization and activation in the brain during initial T. gondii central nervous system infection and highlight the importance of parasite replication in this process. IMPORTANCE Toxoplasma gondii is a brain-infecting parasite, and the mobilization of peripheral immune cells to the brain is critical for controlling T. gondii infection. However, the initial events driving these cells to sites of T. gondii infection in the brain are poorly understood. We show that peripheral myeloid immune cell recruitment and activation are specific to areas of the brain containing actively replicating parasites, which are capable of lysing host cells. This local immune response is characterized by focal chemokine production, myeloid cell recruitment, and the activation of phagolysosomal pathways. These highly localized host responses were independent of the parasite effector protein that induces NF-κB activation within infected cells, GRA15. However, the localized monocyte recruitment was dependent on live parasites and active parasite replication. This research highlights the importance of host cell sensing of parasite replication in the brain for immune control of T. gondii infection.

        <tr id="Introduction The immune and inflammatory responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in the context of long COVID, remain critical areas of study. Understanding these responses is essential for addressing the long-term health impacts of COVID-19. Recent research also highlights the pivotal role of proteases in modulating immune responses and contributing to disease severity, making them a key focus of our analysis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 72 convalescent COVID-19 patients, assessing recovery at three key time points: immediately post-discharge, one month later, and three months post-infection. Additionally, a subset of 15 patients was followed up two years post-COVID-19. Clinical parameters, including demographics, comorbidities, treatment modalities, and COVID-19 severity, were evaluated. Using CyTOF technology, we characterized over 30 immune cell subsets, including granulocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. We also performed multiplexed analyses of blood samples to profile cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and COVID-19-related proteins. Results Our comprehensive approach revealed significant changes in the immune system over time, highlighting the role of specific immune cells and proteases in the recovery process. Key findings include a decreasing deregulatory effect on immune responses exerted by subsequent SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Delta, and Omicron. Conclusion This study provides an in-depth understanding of the molecular dynamics of immune recovery following COVID-19. By integrating clinical profiling, plasma multiplex analysis, antibody profiling, mass cytometry immunophenotyping, in vitro PBMC stimulation, and the role of proteases, we offer valuable insights into the complex interplay of immune, inflammatory, and protease-mediated responses in individuals recovering from COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Objectives: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are at high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019. It is unclear whether anti-viral cellular and humoral immunity is impacted in patients with ILD in the presence of immune disorders and immunosuppressive therapy. This results in poor control of viral infections following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to highlight the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We compared viral clearance, antibody levels, and T-cell immune response between healthy controls and patients with connective tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Results: Patients with ILD exhibited a higher viral load than the control group (1.58 × 106 vs. 2.37 × 103 copies/mL, p = 0.018), as well as a significantly lower level of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type (WT) virus (7.01 vs. 625.6, p < 0.0001) and Omicron BA.5 (7.19 vs. 128.4, p < 0.001). Similarly, a lower virus-specific T-cell (VST) immune response was observed 14 days post-symptom onset in the ILD group (CD4+ VSTs: 0.018 vs. 0.082, p = 0.005; CD8+ VSTs: 0.0008 vs. 0.047, p = 0.004). The ILD group had no other heightened inflammatory biomarkers compared with the control group. Conclusions: Our study provides novel evidence of the underlying interaction between virus clearance and host immune status and sheds light on the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological alterations, ranging from headache and dizziness to severe encephalopathy and inflammatory neurological diseases (IND), and neuropathological findings suggest immune-mediated processes. Therefore, we sought to characterize profiles of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and markers of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis in COVID-19 patients with neurological alterations to identify key factors and mechanisms underlying CNS disturbances in COVID-19. The study included a case series of 52 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations, which were categorized into three groups: isolated refractory headache (n = 14), encephalopathy (n = 24), and IND (n = 14). Individuals with non-inflammatory, non-infectious neurological conditions (n = 9) were included as negative controls. Paired CSF and serum samples were assessed for 56 biomarkers. Regardless of the neurological condition, COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated CSF levels of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-15, IL-25, IFN-α2, CCL7, CCL11, and GM-CSF. Patients with encephalopathy and IND also showed increased IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, neopterin, IL-7, CXCL8, CXCL9, TGF-α, EGF, sTREM-2, and HMGB1, consistent with a CNS cytokine storm. In contrast, individuals with isolated refractory headache showed a modest inflammatory profile, compatible with the limited CNS involvement. COVID-19 patients showed elevated serum IL-13, IL-18, TNF-α, VILIP-1, TGF-α, and VEGF levels, indicating systemic inflammation and potential blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. β-NGF was increased in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, suggesting the activation of neuroprotective responses during patient recovery. Functional protein network analysis showed a significant enrichment of interactions between factors altered in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, many of them related to processes of neuroinflammation and microglial functions, and leukocyte chemotaxis, activation and proliferation. These findings support a model in which both systemic immune activation and localized neuroinflammation contribute to the diversity of neurological outcomes observed in COVID-19, and dysregulated cytokine production, glial activation, inflammasome activity and BBB disturbances represent key factors in neuro-COVID-19 pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease linked with deregulated immune responses, leading to hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis, often with fatal outcomes. Neutrophils play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, with elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts correlating with disease severity. Despite extensive research, the molecular processes associated with neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 remain elusive. Methods To investigate the molecular signatures underlying neutrophil-driven pathology, we conducted transcriptome analysis in neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients versus healthy individuals. To evaluate the specificity of identified neutrophil signatures in COVID-19, we extended our transcriptomic analysis to neutrophils from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a non-infectious fibrotic lung disease. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining was performed on lung biopsy specimens from IPF patients to validate transcriptomic findings at the tissue level. Results Our analysis revealed significant transcriptional changes in COVID-19 neutrophils, particularly in pathways involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and antiviral responses. Additionally, pathways associated with autophagy and chromatin remodeling were upregulated, while translation-related processes were suppressed, indicating an increased predisposition for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release. This neutrophil transcriptional signature in COVID-19 appears to be associated with the previously reported deregulation of the Activin/Follistatin system in the periphery. Notably, a comparative transcriptomic analysis with neutrophils isolated from IPF patients revealed the induction of substantially overlapping inflammatory processes, suggesting common deregulated responses in COVID-19 and IPF. Consistently, significant NET formation, a hallmark of COVID-19-related inflammation, was observed within lung biopsies from IPF patients. Conclusion By delineating both shared and disease-specific molecular pathways, our findings validate the critical role of neutrophils in COVID-19 and IPF pathophysiology, highlighting their involvement in balancing the inflammatory response across diverse lung diseases.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Herpes simplex virus‐1 (HSV‐1) infections are lifelong and linked to neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), yet the underlying mechanisms in the host remain poorly understood. Methods and Results This study investigates new molecular dynamics following HSV‐1 infection, uncovering the pivotal role of the mixed lineage kinase domain‐like (MLKL) protein. Beyond its known function in necroptosis, MLKL was found to control HSV‐1 transport into the nucleus, tightly regulated by Optineurin (OPTN). We evidenced an essential regulatory interaction between MLKL and OPTN, governing MLKL's activity in both necroptosis‐dependent and independent pathways. In vivo, studies using Optn knockout mice demonstrated how this MLKL‐OPTN axis contributes to demyelination and neurological symptoms mimicking MS. This axis critically prevents oligodendrocyte death and the associated demyelination during HSV‐1 infection. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions with Necrosulfonamide (NSA), an MLKL inhibitor, showed therapeutic potential in preserving myelin integrity and reducing neurological deficits in HSV‐1‐infected models, suggesting a viable strategy for managing virus‐induced neurodegeneration. Conclusion Our findings highlight the significant role of MLKL in HSV‐1 pathogenesis and suggest that MLKL dysregulation is a key mechanism behind severe neurological damage. Key points MLKL plays a significant role in regulating endosomal transport of HSV‐1 to nucleus during early stages of infection. Formation of p‐MLKL bodies during HSV‐1 infection leads to death of oligodendrocyte and subsequent demyelination. OPTN can negatively modulate MLKL levels to restrict infection and consequential oligodendrocyte death during HSV‐1 infection.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the world in 2025. The rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2 results in breakthrough infections and diminishes the efficacy of vaccines and anti-viral drugs. The severity of the disease varies across different variants, and the underlying mechanisms driving these differences remain unclear. This study explores the relationship between different Spike variants and cytotoxicity, aiming to determine whether the humanized decoy receptor ACE2-Fc can neutralize spikes from diverse variants, offering a solution to overcome rapid mutating SARS-CoV-2 induced immune escape. Methods We co-cultured 293 T-ACE2 cells with 293 T cells transfected with various Spike protein variants or used H1650-ACE2 cells transfected with these Spike variants. This allowed us to observe the effects of different Spike mutations, specifically focusing on cell fusion, cytotoxicity, and cytokine release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry is employed to determine if ACE2-Fc can recognize different Spike variants. We also assess the ability of ACE2-Fc to inhibit infection, cell fusion, cytotoxicity, and cytokine release through pseudovirus infections or Spike protein transfections. Additionally, we use actual viruses from SARS-CoV-2 patients to validate the impacts of Spike mutations and the effectiveness of ACE2-Fc. Furthermore, human plasma is utilized to evaluate ACE2-Fc’s capability to inhibit Spike-induced clot formation. Results We found that different Spike variants, particularly those with enhancements at the S2' site, increased cell–cell fusion capability, which correlated positively with cytotoxicity and cytokine IL-6 and TNF-α released from PBMCs. ACE2-Fc recognized spikes from wide-range of variants, including wild type, Alpha, Delta, Delta plus, Lambda, BA.2, BA.2.75, BA.5, BF.7, BQ.1, XBB.1, JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3, and effectively prevented these spike-expressing pseudo-viruses from entering host cells. Crucially, ACE2-Fc can prevent spike-induced cell fusion, thereby reducing subsequent cytotoxicity and the release of IL-6 and TNF-α from PBMCs. ACE2-Fc also effectively reduces plasma clot formation induced by trimeric spike proteins. Conclusions These findings demonstrated that ACE2-Fc could effectively combat the infection of rapidly mutating SARS-CoV-2, providing a potential solution to overcome immune evasion.

        <tr id="Most genetic variants that confer risk of complex immune-mediated diseases (IMD) affect gene regulation in specific cell types. Their target genes and focus cell types are often unknown, partially because some effects are hidden in untested cell states. B cells play important roles in IMDs, including autoimmune, allergic, infectious, and cancerous diseases. However, despite this established importance, B cell activation states are underrepresented in functional genomics studies. In this study, we obtained B cells from 26 healthy female donors. We stimulated B cells in vitro with six activation conditions targeting key pathways: the B cell receptor (BCR), Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR9, CD40, and a cocktail that promotes differentiation into double negative 2 (DN2) IgD- CD27- CD11c+ CD21- B cells, a likely pathogenic B cell subset for autoimmunity that is also expanded in infectious diseases. We profiled up to 24 human B cell activation states and up to 5 control conditions using RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq coupled with surface protein markers (CITE-seq), and ATAC-seq. We provide an in-depth characterization of how IMD-associated genes responded to stimuli and group into modules with distinct functions. Using high-depth RNA-seq data, we found pervasive splicing effects during B cell activation. Using single-cell data, we describe stimulus-dependent B cell fates. Chromatin data reveal the transcription factors likely involved in stimulus-dependent B cell activation. These open chromatin regions capture a significant proportion of the genetic risk of IMDs and elucidate IMD genetic risk variants with previously unknown function. These data are shared via an interactive browser that can be used to query the dynamics of gene regulation and B cell differentiation during activation by different stimuli, enhancing further investigation of B cells and their role in IMDs.">

        <tr id="The virus known to cause COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, exhibits severe and complex neurological symptoms. These effects may be attributed to a virus-induced neuroinflammatory environment, warranting exploration of the respiratory centers of the brain, namely the pons and medulla, specifically in relation to neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neuronal death in response to COVID-19. Interestingly, older adults with neurological dysfunction maintained on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, such as memantine, had reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate (1) the neuroinflammatory response to COVID-19 in the respiratory centers of the brain, and (2) to assess the extent to which NMDAR antagonists offer neuroprotective measures in the context of COVID-19. In a susceptible mouse model, animals inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 were pre-treated with either memantine or an alternative NMDAR antagonist, ifenprodil. Inoculated animals had poor survival and showed signs of neuroinflammation, evidenced by a reduction in morphological structure, demyelination, and changes in astrocyte and microglial expression in the pons and medulla. Mice pre-treated with memantine showed improved survival when challenged with COVID-19 and a reduction in virus-induced neuroinflammatory impairments. Our findings support the further investigation of memantine for the prevention of COVID-19 induced neuroinflammation and resultant neurological symptoms and shed light on the possible protective mechanism of memantine in the elderly maintained on NMDAR antagonists.">

        <tr id="Many neurological diseases remain difficult to treat, necessitating further elucidation of their pathogenesis. Conditional inactivation of Pdgfra in Nestin-expressing cells leads to the depletion of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha+ (PDGFRα+) oligodendroglial lineage cells responsible for myelination, resulting in forebrain hypomyelination and severe, progressive neurological deficits in neonatal mice. The present study examined the cerebral cortex of these mice to better understand the mechanisms underlying such progressive neurological deficits, that are often observed in refractory neurological diseases. Histological and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses showed that, following activation of meningeal border-associated macrophages (BAMs), PDGFRα+ fibroblasts that escaped gene inactivation were extensively recruited from the meninges into the hypomyelinated subpial cerebral cortex. Transcriptional reprogramming suggested that these fibroblasts originated from the pial fibroblast lineage and adopted a myofibroblast-like transcriptional phenotype. The recruited fibroblasts established stable cell–cell interactions with activated brain macrophages, including BAMs and microglia, accompanied by signaling pathways associated with chronic, tissue-damaging inflammation. Subsequently, inflammatory cortical lesions emerged, characterized by glial activation, angiogenesis, and neuronal oxidative stress. Treatment with a PDGFRα-neutralizing antibody significantly reduced fibroblast recruitment and mitigated glial activation and angiogenesis. These findings suggest that meningeal BAMs and pial fibroblasts are key contributors to the formation of tissue-damaging subpial cortical lesions. The interactions between brain macrophages and pial fibroblasts may contribute to the mechanisms underlying chronic and progressive neurological deficits and represent potential therapeutic targets for refractory neurological diseases.

        <tr id="Rasmussen Encephalitis (RE) is a chronic, unilateral epileptic disorder mostly found in children. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by T lymphocyte infiltration targeting neurons and leading to microglia activation, astrogliosis, and cortical degeneration. Within a patient’s brain, distinct pathological stages are found that offer a unique opportunity to study T cell dynamics in situ. Using quantitative multiplex fluorescence imaging, we analyzed CD103+ and CD69+ Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) across different disease stages. This analysis revealed that TRM were more abundant in the parenchyma than in the perivascular space, suggesting that their differentiation occurs locally after antigen encounter. Further, part of the TRM expressed Granzyme-B (GrB) and frequently were attached to neurons, suggesting that they are actively involved in neuronal destruction. While TRM showed a stage-dependent increase in older lesions, the proportions of these cells did not correlate with disease duration, indicating that their accumulation may be more dependent on the local environment in the lesion than on the length of the disease. In addition, we found that T cells using the γδ T cell receptor comprised up to 66%. Like CD8+ T cells, the γδ T cells could develop a TRM phenotype and, while expressing GrB+ granules, they were seen attached to neurons, suggesting that they are involved in neuronal destruction. Finally, analysis of exhaustion- and TRM-associated immune checkpoint control markers PD-1 and LAG-3 revealed a significant stage-dependent increase in PD-1 expression in the oldest lesions. In contrast, LAG-3 expression did not show any stage-specific pattern, pointing towards a distinct regulatory mechanism. The study demonstrates a dynamic and one-way T cell response throughout the course of RE at a given spot in the CNS: from the establishment of T cell residence after entry into the CNS, the killing of neurons, and eventually T cell exhaustion. It further suggests an important role of γδ T-cells in the propagation of disease and lesions.

        <tr id="Background Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition (here abbreviated as post-COVID) is an escalating global health issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of post-COVID following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and anxiety. Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol. Results We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent. Conclusions Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.">

The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 health crisis has exposed a deficiency in understanding the previously elucidated mechanisms; the rationale for the reported variability in symptomatology among COVID-19 patients is extensive and intricate. It is evident that NK cells exert a significant influence on symptom severity, and their absence, with the presence or absence of their surface receptors, elicits a tailored response to the virus. This overview examines the impact of NK cells on the progression of several viral diseases, emphasizing their involvement in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 via the activation of surface receptors.">

        <tr id="Background: Currently the role of dengue virus (DENV) specific T cell responses in disease pathogenesis and protection are not well understood, including potential differences in those who have obesity. We sought to investigate the functionality and phenotype of T cells in patients with acute dengue fever (DF) or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Methods: T cell function was assessed in patients with DF (n=50) and DHF (n=12), recruited within 4 days of illness and again on day 5 to 7, using 109 peptides representing CD8+ T cell epitopes and 90 peptides targeting CD4+ T cell epitopes. Phenotypic analysis was in DF (n=21) and DHF patients (n=21), recruited between days 6 to 8 since onset of illness, by multicolor flow cytometry. Results: The frequency of ex vivo IFN{gamma} ELISpot responses to both the CD4+ and CD8+ peptides pools significantly increased from the first to second time point in patients with DF (p<0.0001) but not with DHF. The frequency of ex vivo IFN{gamma} ELISpot responses to CD4+ (p=0.001) and CD8+ peptides pools (p=0.0002) also significantly increased from the first to second time point in lean patients compared obese patients. Cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen (CLA) expression was significantly higher in the CD8+ T cell subset in patients with DF and DHF compared to HC and these differences were most significant in CD8+CD45RA- T cells. CD8+CD45RA-CLA+ T cells consisted of >50% of the T cells in 9/21 patients with DHF, with 92.7% expressing CD38. CLA expression was highest in the CD8+CD45RA- of obese individuals, which was significantly higher compared to lean individuals (p=0.01). CD27 and CD127 were both significantly downregulated in patients with DHF compared to DF, with ICOS expression being significantly higher in CD8+ T cells in DHF. Discussion: Patients with DHF and obese individuals had impaired T cell functionality. Activated and skin homing CD8+ T cells were associated with DHF, with downregulation of CD27 and CD127. Therefore, the role of skin homing T cells, which have impaired functionality in disease pathogenesis, should be further investigated.">

        <tr id="The ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants highlights the importance of monitoring immune responses to guide vaccination strategies. Although neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) have garnered increasing attention, T-cells are crucial for conferring long-lasting immunity, especially their resilience against viral mutations. However, assessing T-cell responses clinically has been hindered by cost and complexity. In this study, we recruited a cohort of 134 healthy adults, who had been immunized with three doses of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine. Cellular immunity elicited by a comprehensive array of overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the virus’s structural proteins was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Additionally, a dataset including demographic information, routine blood indices, and immune cell indicators comprising 32 variables was collected. Multivariate analysis revealed age and days post-vaccination as key factors influencing the strength of the T-cell response. Importantly, random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were employed, along with 8 easily accessible indicators to formulate predictive models for the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Besides, these models demonstrated substantial accuracy (r > 0.9) in both the training and testing sets. Our findings offer an efficient and economical methodology for evaluating the T-cell reactions in healthy adults following inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, which is visualizable and easy to use, providing a novel strategy for assessing cellular immunity after vaccination.

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis (VMC), a multifaceted pathological condition predominantly triggered by viral infections, has emerged as a major worldwide healthcare concern due to its intricate pathogenesis and substantial disease burden. Although the centrality of immune dysregulation in driving VMC progression is well-established, the precise identities of distinct immune cell subsets and their molecular mediators governing pathological progression continue to present significant knowledge gaps. Single-cell datasets were integrated using quality control, batch correction, and normalization. The FindAllMarkers function identified marker genes for each cluster. Cell types were annotated based on literature-derived marker genes. DESeq2 was employed to identify differentially expressed genes in T cells. CellChat was used to explore intercellular communication and identify key ligand-receptor signaling pathways. Receiver operating characteristic curves assessed the predictive performance of key factors in a validation cohort. T cells were re-annotated for higher-resolution subtyping, and pseudotime analysis depicted the cell trajectories of T cell subtypes. Integrated single-cell data revealed a comprehensive single-cell atlas of VMC. Mechanistic delineation of T cell as principal pathogenic effectors emerged through multi-omics interrogation incorporating single-cell transcriptomic profiling and pathological trajectory reconstruction; functional genomics analyses further substantiated their cardinal involvement in cardiotropic viral pathogenesis. Additionally, communication analysis highlighted CCL as a critical immune regulatory pathway for T cell interactions in VMC. Significant upregulation of CCL3 was confirmed in the validation cohort, establishing it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for VMC. Pseudotime analysis and re-annotation of T cell subpopulations revealed significant enrichment of T.8EFF.OT1LISO and T.Tregs in VMC. This study identifies T cells as key immune players in VMC, with CCL3 proposed as a novel biomarker for the condition.">

Despite extensive research, many immunological and physiological aspects of LCs function remain poorly understood. In this study, we combined single-cell transcriptomic analysis and intravital imaging to reconstruct the activation trajectory of epidermal LCs and identified a distinct intermediate state that precedes their migration. We present a high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic dataset of over 22,000 high-quality epidermal LCs under both injured and homeostatic conditions. We found similar LCs responses to chemical and physical skin injuries. Our analysis defines specific LCs subpopulations representing sequential activation stages, characterized at the level of pathways and transcription factors. Notably, we identified a previously unrecognized population of activated LCs distinguished by the expression of complement system components and receptors. Integrating our data with an external dataset of wounded and unwounded skin revealed that wound-specific, WNT-modulated fibroblasts are the primary source of C3, the central component of the complement cascade. Intravital imaging of C3-deficient mice demonstrated that C3 is essential for the effective recruitment of activated LCs to wound sites. Together, these findings uncover a novel population of activated epidermal LCs and highlight complement signaling as a critical mediator of LCs recruitment during skin injury.">

        <tr id="Background The airway epithelium represents the first line of defense of the lungs, functioning both as a physical barrier as well as an active immune modulator. However, in the last years, pneumonia caused by the opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii have become difficult to treat due to the increase of the number of extensively drug resistant strains. In this study, we report for the first time the use of an ex vivo air–liquid interface (ALI) model of differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells to unravel the early response to A. baumannii infection. Methods Epithelial integrity, tissue architecture, and goblet cell function were assessed through FITC-dextran permeability assays, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and indirect immunofluorescence. Transcriptomic profiling was performed to characterize host gene expression changes. Results Initial tissue damage began as early as at 4 h post-infection (hpi); at 24 hpi, goblet cell hypertrophy, reduced mucin secretion, and compromised epithelial integrity were highly evident. Transcriptomic data at 4 hpi revealed 668 differentially expressed genes (441 upregulated, 227 downregulated), mainly involved in a strong pro-inflammatory response and characterized by IL-8/CCL20-driven neutrophil recruitment and type 2 cytokine activation (IL-4, IL-13). Noteworthy, genes related to cytoskeletal organization, adhesion, and extracellular matrix remodeling were significantly altered, suggesting a bacterial mechanism to enhanced tissue dissemination. The PI3K-Akt survival pathway was inhibited, with downregulation of PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 genes, implying the induction of apoptosis/cell death and epithelial damage. Our findings are in agreement with previous in vivo studies, further strengthening the value of our ALI model in mimicking the early infection response of bronchial cells to A. baumannii infection. Conclusion Our data highlight the early molecular mechanisms underlying A. baumannii pathogenesis and open new avenues for future investigations for therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction In severe COVID-19, excessive cytokine release may be driven by SARS-CoV-2. We investigated the modulatory effect of probiotics taking into consideration direct interaction with the immune gut cells. Methods Fifty-five patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were classified by the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or not. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a preparation of four probiotics (LactoLevure® containing Saccharomyces boulardii, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, and L. plantarum) and/or recombinant human interferon-gamma (rhIFNγ) and tocilizumab. Cytokine concentrations were measured in cell supernatants. Gene expression of Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4) was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results were associated with the level of viremia. Results Probiotics decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) production by the PBMCs of both ARDS and non-ARDS patients. LPS stimulated the production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 in non-ARDS patients. IL-6 production was maintained in the presence of probiotics. rhIFNγ enhanced LPS-stimulated cytokine production by PBMCs; this was not the case when PBMCs were stimulated by probiotics. Probiotics upregulated TLR2 and LPS downregulated TLR4 in the PBMCs of patients with ARDS. PBMCs from patients with viremia had more cytokine production by probiotic stimulation. Conclusion Probiotics interact with the immune system of COVID-19 patients by modulating the production of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in an IFNγ-independent mechanism.">

Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, we measured 1101 metabolites. The results revealed distinct metabolic profiles in acute COVID-19 and MIS-C patients, with significant alterations in lipid classes. Both conditions exhibited an elevated Apo-B100/Apo-A1 ratio and increased serum inflammatory markers. MIS-C patients showed unique disruptions, including increased triglycerides and altered lipoprotein composition. Despite milder clinical respiratory symptoms, children’s metabolic disturbances mirrored those seen in severe adult COVID-19 patients, indicating a shared inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2.

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to human health. The outcome of IAV results from the viral-host interaction, with the underlying molecular mechanisms largely unknown. By integrating the plasma proteomics data of the IAV-infected patients into the viral-inflammation protein-protein interaction (VI-PPI) network created in this study, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), the critical enzyme in purine salvage, was identified as a potential hub gene that connected the different stages of IAV infection. Extended survival rates and reduced pulmonary inflammatory lesions were observed in alveolar epithelial cell (AEC)-specific PNP conditional knockout mice upon H1N1 infection. Mechanistically, PB1-F2 of IAV was revealed as a novel viral transcriptional factor to bind to the TATA box of PNP promoter, leading to enhanced purine salvage in H1N1-challenged AECs. The activation of PNP-mediated purine salvage was verified in IAV-infected patients and A549 cells. PNP knockdown elicited a purine metabolic shift from augmented salvage pathway to de novo synthesis, constraining both viral infection and pro-inflammatory signaling through APRT-AICAR-AMPK activation. Moreover, durdihydroartemisinin (DHA), predicted by VI-PPI as a novel PNP inhibitor, exerted beneficial effects on the survival and weight gain of H1N1-challenged mice via its direct binding to PNP. To reveal for the first time, we found that PNP, activated by IAV, plays a hub role within H1N1-host interaction, simultaneously modulating viral replication and hyperinflammation through purine salvage. Our study sheds new light on a “two-for-one” strategy by targeting purine salvage in combating IAV-related pathology, suggesting PNP as a potential novel anti-influenza host target.">

        <tr id="The soluble S1 subunit of Spike protein (SP) from the SARS‐CoV-2 of different variants of concern (VOCs) may directly bind and activate human NK cells in vitro through the engagement of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4. This mechanism revealed a novel pathogenic role played by NK cells not only in the different phases of disease but also in the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) and some post-vaccination side effects. In addition to its binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates virus attachment and cell entry, soluble SP triggers several active receptors/molecules expressed by many cells, inducing, in turn, type I/III interferon decrease, altered autophagy and apoptosis, the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, complement activation and endothelial damage, which favour clotting events. In this review, we discuss the hypothesis that circulating SP, exerting multiple biological activities, can explain the heterogeneity of the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19, PASC and post-vaccine-related effects. Recent reports have clearly indicated that soluble SARS-CoV-2 and post-vaccination SP trigger the same cascade of events, acting on the immune response and promoting defined adverse events. Factors hindering the pathological activity of soluble SP are the SP plasma levels, the age of the infected/vaccinated people and the efficiency of protein synthesis of ectopic targets triggered by soluble SP, as well as the specificity, the titre and the affinity of anti-SP antibodies elicited by the infection. At present, the risk/benefit ratio is largely in favour of vaccination; however, the excessive and persistent ectopic production of synthetic SP should be systematically analysed. This would allow for the identification of subjects at risk for major adverse events and to answer the urgent need for efficient vaccines that provide long-lasting activity with minimal side effects.">

        <tr id="Purpose The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 and RA through immune inflammation. Methods First, we conducted a meta-analysis on the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization rate, and mortality rate for patients with RA. Then, Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate the causal relationship between COVID-19 and RA, and further analyzed the cytokines and immune cells in COVID-19 and RA. Finally, we obtained microarray datasets of COVID-19, RA patients, and normal controls from the GEO database. And performed functional, pathway enrichment, and immune cell infiltration analysis on differentially expressed genes between each group. Results The meta-analysis results suggested that the hospitalization rate and mortality rate of RA patients infected with COVID-19 were higher than those of the control population. MR analysis showed a positive correlation between COVID-19 infection and RA. We also found that interleukin 13 was associated with RA and COVID-19 infection. CD27 on IgD + CD24 + B cells and CD3 on CD39 + CD8 + T cells are common immune cell phenotypes in two diseases. In addition, COVID-19 function is enriched in immune responses mediated by leukocytes and neutrophils, while RA is significantly enriched in the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. The results of immune cell infiltration showed that both diseases had more neutrophils and fewer CD8 T cells. Conclusion There are many similarities between COVID-19 and RA in immune inflammatory responses such as cytokines and immune cells. COVID-19 may lead to the development of RA through immune inflammation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40659-025-00620-7.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The thymus exhibits constitutive activation of nearly all major inflammatory pathways, including sterile MyD88‐dependent signaling and interferon production by mTECs, the presence of cellular and molecular components of type 1, type 2, and type 3 responses, as well as sustained B cell activation. The reasons for the existence of such a complex constitutively active inflammatory network at the site of T cell development—where the initial pathogen encounter is unlikely—have remained enigmatic. We propose that this inflammatory thymic ‘ecosystem’ has evolved to promote immunological tolerance to ‘inflammatory self’—endogenous molecules absent from most peripheral tissues at steady state but upregulated during pathogen invasion. The spatial and temporal overlap with pathogen presence makes the discrimination of the inflammatory self from pathogen‐derived molecules a unique challenge for the adaptive immune system. The frequent occurrence of diseases associated with autoantibodies against proinflammatory cytokines underscores the persistent risk of these molecules being misidentified as foreign. Their abundant representation in the thymus, therefore, is likely to be critical for maintaining tolerance. This review explores current insights into the thymic inflammatory network, its cellular and molecular constituents, and their role in the induction of T cell tolerance.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Long Covid is a post‐viral syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms targeting multiple organ systems after initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Current literature suggests that the mechanisms causing Long Covid involve viral persistence, immune dysregulation, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. By forming reservoirs in the tissues of various organs, SARS‐CoV‐2 may evade immunological clearances while triggering immune responses and contributing to chronic symptoms through cytokine imbalances, T‐cell exhaustion, and systemic inflammation. These symptoms parallel other post‐viral syndromes such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting similar mechanisms of pathology. The coronavirus has also been linked to neuroinflammation and endothelial dysfunction causing cognitive symptoms and cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, its ability to lower energy production links it to post‐exertion malaise (PEM) and muscle pain. These symptoms may result from iron dysregulation and persistent oxidative stress due to Covid‐impaired mitochondrial function. This review synthesizes current data on the mechanisms that drive Long Covid pathogenesis and explores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate viral persistence, immune dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. It is critical to understand these interactions to develop targeted interventions that address the long‐term sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="This study investigates the interplay between cellular senescence and inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We employed RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression changes in HUVECs subjected to replicative- or radiation-stress-induced senescence, and we compared these profiles with those of cells under acute or chronic TNFα-mediated inflammation. Our findings reveal that both senescence types exhibited significant upregulation of genes associated with epithelial- (or endothelial) mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammatory pathways, indicating a shared molecular response. Notably, chronic inflammation led to a pronounced EMT signature, while acute inflammation primarily activated classical inflammatory responses. Experimental validation confirmed reduced proliferation and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in senescent and chronically inflamed cells and substantiated the upregulation of EMT marker genes. Additionally, we observed impaired wound healing capacity in senescent and chronically inflamed cells, highlighting the functional consequences of these cellular states. Our study underscores the critical role of inflammation in exacerbating senescence-related changes, contributing to the understanding of age-related cardiovascular pathologies. These insights may inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of aging and inflammation on endothelial function and cardiovascular health.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in millions of deaths globally. Adults with immunosuppression (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients) and those undergoing active cancer treatments experience worse infections and more severe COVID-19. It is difficult to conduct clinical studies in these populations, resulting in a restricted amount of data that can be used to relate mechanisms of immune dysfunction to COVID-19 outcomes in these vulnerable groups. To study immune dynamics after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to investigate drivers of COVID-19 severity in individuals with cancer and immunosuppression, we adapted our mathematical model of the immune response during COVID-19 and generated virtual patient cohorts of cancer and immunosuppressed patients. The cohorts of plausible patients recapitulated available longitudinal clinical data collected from patients in Montréal, Canada area hospitals. Our model predicted that both cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients with severe COVID-19 had decreased CD8 + T cells, elevated interleukin-6 concentrations, and delayed type I interferon peaks compared to those with mild COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, our results suggest that cancer patients experience higher viral loads (however, with no direct relation with severity), likely because of decreased initial neutrophil counts (i.e., neutropenia), a frequent toxic side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, severe cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients suffered a high degree of tissue damage associated with elevated neutrophils. Lastly, parameter values associated with monocyte recruitment by infected cells were found to be elevated in severe cancer and immunosuppressed patients with respect to the COVID-19 reference group. Together, our study highlights that dysfunctions in type I interferon and CD8 + T cells are key drivers of immune dysregulation in COVID-19, particularly in cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world, but our understanding of causation is still lacking. A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD. Methods This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation. Results Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Discussion Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.">

        <tr id="Abstract Arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV), Ross River (RRV), and O’nyong nyong virus (ONNV), are emerging and reemerging viruses that cause disease characterized by fever, rash, and incapacitating muscle and joint pain and inflammation. Alphavirus infection induces robust immune responses, leading to the upregulation of several cytokines and chemokines, including chemokine C ligand 4 (CCL4). CCL4 is a chemoattractant for immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, recruiting these cells to the site of infection, stimulating the release of proinflammatory mediators, and inducing T cell differentiation. CCL4 has been found at high levels in both the acute and chronic phases of chikungunya disease; however, the role of CCL4 in arthritogenic alphavirus disease development remains unexplored. Here, we tested the effect of CCL4 on MAYV infection in mice through antibody neutralization and treatment with recombinant mouse CCL4. We observed no differences in mice depleted of CCL4 or treated with recombinant CCL4 in terms of disease progression such as weight loss and footpad swelling or the development of viremia. CCL4 uses the G protein-coupled receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). To determine whether CCR5 deficiency would alter disease outcomes or virus replication in mice, we inoculated CCR5 knockout (CCR5−−) mice with MAYV and observed no effect on disease development and immune cell profile of blood and footpads between CCR5−/− and wild type mice. These studies failed to identify a clear role for CCL4 or its receptor CCR5 in MAYV infection.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (CD83, LAMP3), lymph node migration (CCR7, ADAM19), and inflammation (TRAF1, IL24) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and systemic immune responses, particularly through the gut–lung axis. Disruptions in gut microbial diversity and function—commonly referred to as dysbiosis—have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we assessed the gut bacteriome and permeability in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using 16S sequencing and ELISA assays, respectively. We also measured blood inflammatory cytokines and fecal secretory IgA to evaluate systemic and mucosal immune responses. Significant alterations in both alpha and beta diversity metrics were observed in patients with COVID-19 (n = 79) and those with post-COVID-19 condition (n = 141) compared to the controls (n = 97). Differential abundance and taxonomic analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles in the infected groups. Increased plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and zonulin were detected in patient samples. Some genera were elevated during acute infection, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia-Shigella were associated with increased zonulin levels, indicating compromised intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that gut dysbiosis may contribute to bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the gut–lung axis and suggest that modulating the gut microbiota could support immune regulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) represent one of the most susceptible populations for developing severe COVID-19, and a unique human genetic condition for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility of neurologically vulnerable individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human Chromosome-21 (HSA21) triplication in DS causes global transcriptional deregulation, affecting multiple genes that may directly (e.g., TMPRSS2) or indirectly influence the SARS-CoV-2 entry into central nervous system (CNS) cells. The anti-viral immune response may also be altered in cells with trisomy-21 (T21) due to triplication of genes encoding for several interferon receptor subunits and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we demonstrate that human cells derived from fetal cortical specimens and maintained in primary cultures are susceptible to infection with a molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to express the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and to authentic SARS-CoV-2. The level of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cultures originated from different cortical specimens varied, seemingly depending on ploidy and chromosomal sex of the cells. We confirmed the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cultures and found that XY T21 group had the highest TMPRSS2 mRNA levels, which was associated with increased infectivity in XY—compared to XX T21 cultures. The XX T21 cultures exhibited elevated expression of several ISGs (MX1, STAT1, and STAT2) which was associated with lower infectivity. The comparisons of postmortem aged brain specimens revealed reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2, but elevated STAT2 protein levels in individuals with DS and Alzheimer’s disease (DS-AD) compared to control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) group. Collectively, these results suggest multifactorial regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cortical cells that involves ploidy, chromosomal sex, and the expression of genes implicated in regulation of virus entry and anti-viral response as contributing factors.

        <tr id="Macrophages play a crucial role in coordinating the skeletal muscle repair response, but their phenotypic diversity and the transition of specialized subsets to resolution-phase macrophages remain poorly understood. Here, to address this issue, we induced injury and performed single-cell RNA sequencing on individual cells in skeletal muscle at different time points. Our analysis revealed a distinct macrophage subset that expressed high levels of Gpnmb and that coexpressed critical factors involved in macrophage-mediated muscle regeneration, including Igf1, Mertk and Nr1h3. Gpnmb gene knockout inhibited macrophage-mediated efferocytosis and impaired skeletal muscle regeneration. Functional studies demonstrated that GPNMB acts directly on muscle cells in vitro and improves muscle regeneration in vivo. These findings provide a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of macrophages during muscle injury, highlighting the key role of the GPNMB macrophage subset in regenerative processes. Our findings suggest that modulating GPNMB signaling in macrophages may represent a promising avenue for future research into therapeutic strategies for enhancing skeletal muscle regeneration.">

        <tr id="Background Persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 is an increasing problem after COVID-19 disease. The pathogenesis of this persistent post Covid-19 Condition (PCC) is, however, largely unknown. We hypothesized that persistent T cell activation and exhaustion play a role in PCC development. Methods We examined plasma levels of soluble (s) CD25, TIM-3 and LAG-3, all markers of T cell activation/exhaustion, by enzyme immunoassays in 170 home-isolated and 53 hospitalized patients for up to 18 months after COVID-19 in relation to persistent symptomatology. Results Our major findings were: (i) Cases with persistent dyspnea and fatigue had markedly higher sCD25 at 6–18 months with a more modest increase in sTIM-3. (ii) Cases with memory problems at 12–18 months had increased sLAG-3 iii) sCD25 correlated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and microneutralization titers only in cases with PCC while sTIM-3 correlated with these parameters irrespectively of symptoms. iv) Although hospitalized patients had markedly elevated levels of T cell activation/exhausting markers during follow-up, there was no relation to PCC symptoms. Conclusion Our study indicates a role for T cell activation/exhaustion in PCC following home isolated COVID-19 infection, with somewhat different patterns of sCD25, sTIM-3 and sLAG-3, but not in hospitalized COVID-19 patients where disease severity may be more important.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and often exhibit reduced vaccine efficacy due to chronic immunosuppression. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, understanding immune responses following natural infection remains critical for informing protection strategies in this vulnerable population. We conducted a longitudinal study of SOT recipients who had recovered from Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 infection, evaluating immune responses to the JN.1 subvariant at 4-6 weeks and 1 year postinfection.


METHODS
Neutralizing antibodies to JN.1 were measured using a pseudovirus neutralization assay, and JN.1-specific T-cell responses were assessed by flow cytometry. Frequencies of bulk T-cells and innate immune cells, identified via flow cytometry, and their correlation with adaptive responses were also analyzed.


RESULTS
At 4-6 weeks, 30% of participants had detectable JN.1-neutralizing antibodies, rising to 43% at one year, although titers remained low. In contrast, CD4⁺ T-cell responses were robust and detected in 75%-83% of participants at 4-6 weeks, increasing to 75%-93% by 1 year. CD8⁺ T-cell responses were observed less frequently. Exploratory correlations between innate and bulk T-cell subsets with heterologous adaptive immune responses were investigated but did not reveal statistically significant relationships.


CONCLUSION
These findings offer important insights into the durability and breadth of immunity following natural infection in immunocompromised transplant recipients. While heterologous neutralizing antibodies were limited, sustained CD4+ T-cell responses may help mitigate severe disease following exposure to JN.1-derived variants, which continue to dominate the SARS-CoV-2 landscape.">

        <tr id="Background The interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections presents a critical challenge to immunopathogenesis. While HIV infection induces progressive CD4+ T cell depletion and chronic immune dysfunction, SARS-CoV-2 triggers complex host responses, ranging from localized antiviral defense to systemic hyperinflammation. We aimed to illustrate the plasma proteomic profiles of hospitalized patients coinfected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Methods Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze the plasma protein profiles in three matched groups: (1) seven hospitalized patients with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, (2) seven people living with HIV (PLWH) who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and (3) seven healthy controls. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed on the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Results We quantified 5,373 proteins across 21 samples and identified significant alterations in multiple proteins in people living with HIV (PLWH) with COVID-19 compared to both PLWH and healthy controls. These DEPs were associated with inflammatory responses, immune cell migration, degranulation, and, notably, the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition, we identified DEPs associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral receptors, proteases, transcription factors, and kinases. Conclusions The proteomic profile highlighted the disruption caused by COVID-19 in immunomodulation, thrombosis, and viral entry pathways in PLWH. Further validation of these signatures could improve risk stratification and tailored interventions for this vulnerable patient cohort.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes infiltrate the CNS in response to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and form a pool of long-lived brain tissue-resident memory T-cells (bTRMs), which display markers of residency (i.e., CD103, CD69, CD49a). However, the functional role of these bTRMs is still unknown. By 30 days postinfection, a latent viral brain infection was established, as indicated by absence of viral transcripts (IE1, E1, and gB) produced during productive infection. Following intracerebroventricular injection of either depleting α-CD8 Ab (clone YTS169.4) or α-CD103-sap (clone IT50) into the brain, 90–95% T-cell depletion was achieved. Using luciferase-expressing mice, we observed recommenced imaging signals indicative of de novo MCMV IE promoter activity in depleted animals. Surprisingly, using an explant assay, we efficiently recovered reactivatable, infectious virus from untreated, latent animals, but not from those depleted of bTRMs (viral recovery in explants was reduced from 100% to 50% by day 21). We identified Lgals3 (galectin 3), Gpnmb (glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B) and Hmox1 (heme oxygenase 1) as genes that were most upregulated in bTRM-depleted groups. When bTRMs were depleted, there was transient expression of viral IE genes which resulted in antiviral microglia with a phagocytic, disease-associated (DAM) or neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype. These data provide new insights into the role of bTRMs in controlling both CNS reactivation and driving microglial phenotypes.">

        <tr id="A series of hyper immune responses as combined reaction of innate and adaptive immunity may lead to cytokine storm prolonging sickness and causing severities among patients of respiratory infection in general and attack COVID-19 patients in particular. We measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines viz. TNF-alpha, Interleukin-6 and Interferon-gamma. The initiation of immune system against viral infection involves role of cytokines. In Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, high levels of cytokine were observed which led to severity in immune-compromised patients, elderly and even mildly infected patients. High levels of cytokines have not only been observed in SARS-CoV-2 but are also prevalent in other human coronavirus infections. There are other respiratory diseases occurring in the form of epidemics and outbreaks in all parts of the world, yet understanding of the fact that when system gets infected by more than one respiratory virus, the cytokine expression observed has not been looked upon.

This is irrespective of the fact that antibodies may already be present against respiratory diseases within the system over the course of time. We hereby hypothesise that if cytokine storm due to such condition may lead to activation of Th1/Th2 response, develop severity/complications and ultimately may lead to lung damage. In this study, we measured the cytokine response profiles (TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 and IFN-gamma) in patients with respiratory viral infections and we observed that TNF-α is the main factor contributing to cytokine storm and that hyper innate immune response is brought by mucosal immunity during infection by SARS-CoV-2.">

Neurological symptoms such as chemosensory dysfunction are frequently observed during acute infection and approximately 10% of COVID-19 cases will go on to develop new or persistent long-term symptoms, a condition known in the literature as post-acute symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC) or by the patient-coined term Long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The emergence of Long COVID has prompted renewed interest in the study of post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), particularly in the area of neuroimmune interactions. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the current body of literature on neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Long COVID, with an emphasis on neuroimmune mechanisms drawn largely from autopsy studies and animal models.

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Several years after the COVID‐19 pandemic, the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immunity and the potential protective role of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination through trained immunity remain a subject of investigation. This study aimed to determine the long‐term impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immune cells and the association between BCG vaccination, latent infections and COVID‐19 severity and sepsis progression. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of patients who recovered from mild/severe/critical COVID‐19 (n = 97, 3–17 months after COVID‐19) and sepsis patients (n = 64). First, we assessed the impact of COVID‐19 and its severity on immune cell frequencies and expression of functional markers. Further, we analysed plasma titres of anti‐Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies and their association with COVID‐19 severity and sepsis outcome. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID‐19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS‐CoV‐2 and LPS. Results Post‐COVID‐19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterised by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post‐critical COVID‐19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. A trend toward improved outcomes in BCG‐seropositive COVID‐19/sepsis patients was observed, although this may be confounded by age differences between groups. In contrast, the monocyte response to stimulation appeared unaffected by COVID‐19 severity. Conclusion These findings highlight the long‐term alterations of immune cells in post‐COVID‐19 patients, emphasising the substantial impact of COVID‐19 on immune function.">

        <tr id="Background: In just twenty years, three dangerous human coronaviruses—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have exposed critical gaps in early detection of emerging viral threats. Current diagnostics remain pathogen-focused, often missing the earliest phase of infection. A virus-agnostic, host-based diagnostic capable of detecting responses to viral intrusion is urgently needed. Methods: We hypothesized that the lungs act as biomechanical instruments, with infection altering tissue tension, wave propagation, and flow dynamics in ways detectable through subaudible vibroacoustic signals. In a matched case–control study, we enrolled 19 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls across two Johns Hopkins hospitals. Multimodal data were collected, including passive vibroacoustic auscultation, lung ultrasound, peak expiratory flow, and laboratory markers. Machine learning models were trained to identify host-response biosignatures from anterior chest recordings. Results: 19 COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls (mean BMI 32.4 kg/m2, mean age 48.6 years) were successfully enrolled to the study. The top-performing, unoptimized, vibroacoustic-only model achieved an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.67–0.92). The host-covariate optimized model achieved an AUC of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.94–1.0), with 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 82–100%) and 99.6% specificity (95% CI: 85–100%). Vibroacoustic data from the anterior chest alone reliably distinguished COVID-19 cases from controls. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that passive, noninvasive vibroacoustic biosignatures can detect host response to viral infection in a hospitalized population and supports further testing of this modality in broader populations. These findings support the development of scalable, host-based diagnostics to enable early, agnostic detection of future pandemic threats (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04556149).">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 776 million confirmed cases and more than 7 million deaths worldwide. In addition to humans, various animal species have exhibited natural infections, with mink being the only farmed animals consistently linked to severe illness and zoonotic transmission to humans. This study investigates histological pulmonary lesions in Danish farm mink infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), focusing on groups with different clinical signs and outcomes. Results Histopathological evaluations revealed lesions in SARS-CoV-2-positive mink with and without clinical signs of disease. The main findings in lungs from SARS-CoV-2-positive mink in all study groups were extensive respiratory epithelial damage, acute diffuse alveolar damage, and vascular lesions, including the formation of thrombi. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of viral particles primarily in the respiratory epithelia. Lymphoid cells exhibited nodular and perivascular aggregates similar to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in older SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected mink, indicating a potential age-related feature of mink lungs. Conclusions The presence of subclinical and long-term pulmonary lesions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in farm mink suggests that the impact of outbreaks may be more serious than clinical signs records indicate. The current SARS-CoV-2 surveillance system on Danish mink farms does not properly address such problems and repeated outbreaks on farms could occur without detection if there are no clinical signs or increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2. The severity of subclinical lesions reveals hidden health and welfare challenges in mink, underscoring the need for improved prevention measures, surveillance and understanding of long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mink.

        <tr id="Recent research has proposed several host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection and involved in the inflammatory response. Among these, members of the human serpin family and PAR2 have been suggested to play a relevant role. As it has been shown that one of the multiple activities of protease inhibitor SerpinB3 is the activation of PAR2, we have modulated the expression of these two molecules on both human bronchial and hepatic cells and assessed cell surface Spike binding and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our findings indicate that both SerpinB3 and PAR2 play a pivotal role in viral infection and downregulate the expression of interferon-γ, a cytokine with a well-known antiviral effect. These results underscore the potential of the SerpinB3-PAR2 axis as a target for antiviral therapy and provide support for addressing serpins as targets for this purpose.">

        <tr id="In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a systemic host response to infection with life-threatening consequence which ranks among the top ten causes of death worldwide. Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular and cellular impact of sepsis remains rudimentary. Methods A mouse sepsis model was established through LPS induction and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect T helper 1 (Th1) cell subsets and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in septic mice. Additionally, in vivo neutralization experiments were conducted to block IFN-γ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, to explore the regulatory effect of DOCK2 on septic mice. Finally, the regulatory mechanism of DOCK2 was analyzed using an in vivo RNA-seq system. Results We identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a critical downregulating factor for LPS signal pathways. DOCK2-deficient mice were highly sensitive to LPS-induced sepsis and E. coli sepsis with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-γ which were mainly due to hyperresponsive Th1 cells. Ulteriorly, we verified the vital role of DOCK2-mediated Th1 cells in sepsis by neutralizing both IFN-γ and CD4 and found both of which blockade reduced the severity of sepsis in Dock2−/− mice. Mechanically, DOCK2-mediated cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling act in concert to govern peripheral Th1 cell fate. Conclusion Our data indicates that DOCK2 acts as a protective role in regulating systemic inflammation and multi-organ injury in bacterial sepsis by constraining Th1 response. These findings provide new targets for immunomodulatory therapy of sepsis, suggesting that targeting the DOCK2-Th1 axis may become a new strategy to improve systemic inflammatory responses associated with bacterial infections.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to persistent or newly emerging symptoms lasting for months, a condition known as long COVID (LC). The pathophysiology of LC remains poorly understood, with cytokine dysregulation proposed as a key mechanism, although findings across the studies have been inconsistent. Patients and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study using the Olink® Target 96 Inflammation Panel to assess cytokines in COVID-19 (COV) patients at three months and six months post-infection. These profiles were compared with those of individuals recovering from other upper respiratory tract infections (non-COV). Additionally, we analyzed differences between individuals with LC and those who recovered from COVID-19. Predictive models for LC at three months and sixth months post-infection were developed using inflammatory markers and relevant clinical cofactors, including gender, age, BMI, hemogram, Β2-microglobulin, D-dimers, LDH, AST, ALT, Ferritin, vitamin D, CRP, and the severity of acute COVID-19 infection as classified by WHO criteria. Results: We observed a general decline in inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients over time, with only a few cytokines elevated (CCL4 at month 3 and CST5 at month 6) compared to non-COV controls. In LC patients, an early phase of low-grade inflammation transitioned into significant reduction in proinflammatory biomarkers compared to recovered individuals. Rather than indicating immune normalization, this pattern suggests a possible suppression or exhaustion of the immune response in the months following acute infection. Importantly, our predictive modeling demonstrated that this specific cytokine signature, in combination with acute disease severity and clinical cofactors, described well the presence of LC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inflammation-related biomarker dysregulation following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection evolves dynamically over a six-month period. By the sixth month, compared to the third month, the presence of LC is more accurately predicted by a combination of persistent biomarker alteration and the severity of the initial infection, as defined by WHO criteria. This represents a novel insight, as previous studies have primarily associated LC with elevated proinflammatory markers, whereas our results suggest that immune suppression or exhaustion may play a more prominent role in the later stages.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lipid metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of acute viral infections by affecting viral replication and the host immune response. In contrast, the role of host lipid metabolism during chronic viral infection has been less explored. The current study aims to define the role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a primary physiologic receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), during natural gammaherpesvirus infection. Gammaherpesviruses are highly prevalent cancer-associated pathogens that induce and manipulate germinal center responses to establish life-long infection of B cells. Importantly, gammaherpesvirus-infected germinal center B cells are thought to be the target of viral transformation. In this study, we found that global SR-BI deficiency led to increased gammaherpesvirus lytic gene expression in the lungs during the acute stage of infection. Chronic gammaherpesvirus infection of the SR-BI-deficient host was associated with exaggerated germinal center responses and increased differentiation of self-reactive B cells that persisted during the long-term stage of chronic infection. Interestingly, SR-BI-deficient germinal center B cells, although more numerous, failed to support efficient gammaherpesvirus infection. The exaggerated germinal center response was also observed following immunization of the SR-BI-deficient host, unveiling the novel role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of physiological and gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center responses. IMPORTANCE Lipid metabolism affects diverse acute viral infections. In contrast, less is known about the effect of lipid metabolism on chronic virus infection, including in the context of an intact host. Host lipid homeostasis is maintained via a combination of endogenous lipid synthesis that takes place in most cell types and cellular interaction with exogenous, circulating lipids. This study focuses on defining the interaction between SR-BI, a primary HDL receptor, and natural gammaherpesvirus infection. We found that SR-BI deficiency led to increased expression of lytic gammaherpesvirus genes during acute gammaherpesvirus replication in the lungs. Importantly, chronic gammaherpesvirus infection unveiled the physiological role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of the germinal center response, a B cell differentiation process that is critical for physiological B cell responses and that is manipulated by gammaherpesviruses to establish chronic infection.

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) strains mutate rapidly, making it crucial to study their molecular mechanisms for swift vaccine and drug development. Here, we utilized host lung proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling to investigate the underlying pathology caused by the variants. Lung tissues infected with wild‐type GD108, Delta, or Omicron BA.1 variants showed overexpression of proteins and phosphoproteins linked to the innate immune pathway, particularly in the Omicron group, with high activation of NOD‐receptor and RIG‐I like receptor signaling pathways. Protein‐protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed six key proteins, including antiviral innate immune response receptor RIG‐I (DDX58), and five interferon‐related proteins (IFIT2, ISG15, MX1, STAT1, and EIF2AK2), highlighting the importance of the innate immune response in combating all three variants. Kinase prediction analysis suggested that six kinases (DAPK1, DAPK2, DAPK3, PRACK, TTK, and MAP2K2), potentially inhibited by Fostamatinib, were activated across all three variants, and might be potential drug targets, pending further verification. Omicron infection, compared to other mutants, significantly disrupted proteins related to pulmonary structural support, like integrin and collagens, and inhibited efferocytosis, reducing the host's ability to eliminate the pathogen. These findings suggest that innate immune activation and structural disruption may contribute to Omicron‐related pathology, potentially being useful for research into the molecular mechanisms underlying lung injury from SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.">

        <tr id="Multiple lines of evidence suggest that endothelial dysfunction is a key player in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with cytokine storm as one of the main primary causes. Among the mechanisms underlying endothelial damage, clinical findings identify alterations in arginine metabolism, as patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit lower levels of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and upregulated arginase. In this study, we investigated, in human endothelial cells (HUVECs), the effect of conditioned medium from macrophages activated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (CM_S1) on arginine metabolism. The results indicate that CM_S1 causes a marked decrease in eNOS and an increase in arginase, along with a greater intracellular arginine content and the induction of the CAT2 transporter. These effects are ascribable to the inflammatory mediators released by macrophages in CM_S1, mainly TNFα and IL-1β. Since infliximab, an antibody targeting TNFα, and baricitinib, an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway, correct the observed imbalance between eNOS and arginase, our findings suggest the potential efficacy of a combined therapy to counteract endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its impact on public health continue to demand attention as the virus continues to evolve, demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt to diverse selective pressures including immune responses, therapeutic treatments, and prophylactic interventions. The SARS-CoV-2 variant landscape remains dynamic, with new subvariants continuously emerging, many harboring spike protein mutations linked to immune evasion. In this study, we characterized a panel of live SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those key subvariants implicated in recent waves of infection. Our findings revealed a significant variability in mutation patterns in the spike protein across the strains analyzed. Commercial antibodies and human convalescent plasma (HCoP) samples from unvaccinated donors were ineffective in neutralizing the most recent Omicron subvariants, particularly after the emergence of JN.1 subvariant. Using human airway epithelial cells derived from healthy bronchiolar tissue (hBAEC), we established both monoinfections and coinfections involving SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus H1N1 (IFAV_H1N1) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Assessments were conducted to compare viral infectivity and the production and release of immune mediators in the apical and basolateral compartments. Notably, Omicron KP.3.1.1 subvariant induced a more pronounced cytopathic effect in hBAEC compared to its parental strain JN.1 and even surpassed the impact observed with the ancestral wild-type virus (WA1/2020, Washington strain). Furthermore, the coinfection of KP.3.1.1 subvariant with IFAV_H1N1 or RSV did not attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity; instead, it significantly exacerbated the pathogenic synergy in the lung epithelium. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-β, and IL-10 were upregulated in hBAEC following SARS-CoV-2 monoinfection with recent Omicron subvariants as well as during coinfection with IFAV_H1N1 and RSV. Taken together, our findings offer new insights into the immune evasion strategies and pathogenic potential of evolving SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, as well as their interactions with other respiratory viruses, carrying important implications for therapeutic development and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="A liver involvement in Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) has been frequently observed in patients hospitalised for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection during 2020; in such cases, the clinical and prognostic relevance of hepatocellular damage has been widely acknowledged. On the other hand, there is less extensive evidence of liver injury (LI) in the subsequent waves of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of LI and to determine the clinical, biochemical, and immune‐virologic characteristics associated with its development in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients hospitalised in 2021–2022. This single‐centre retrospective study included 455 patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and respiratory failure. LI was defined by the detection of transaminase levels exceeding three times the upper limit of normality (ULN) and was further classified as early or late liver injury based on whether the peak transaminase value occurred within or after 7 days from hospital admission. LI was found in 17.6% (80/455) of the overall cohort, while early liver injury (ELI) and late liver injury (LLI) were detected in 10.4% and 11.5%, respectively. LI was associated with younger age, elevated inflammatory and tissue damage markers, with the presence of chronic liver disease (CLD), and with the use of interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) inhibitors. Patients with LI had a higher probability of severe COVID‐19, transfer to intensive care unit, and in‐hospital death than those without. In multivariable analysis, younger age, administration of IL‐6 inhibitors, and the presence of higher gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were independently related to the development of overall LI, whereas in‐hospital mortality was independently correlated with the occurrence of LLI. The occurrence of hepatocellular damage therefore has been associated with a pro‐inflammatory profile and with worse overall outcomes but not with increased likelihood of liver failure or liver‐related mortality.">

        <tr id="One of the unknowns related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the mechanism underlying the inflammatory response induced by the virus. Poly(A) polymerase gamma (PAPOLG) was previously shown to be upregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study explored how PAPOLG affects the inflammatory reaction triggered by SARS-CoV-2. PAPOLG was knocked down or overexpressed in THP-1 macrophages. Target pathways were identified using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The levels of PAPOLG, transcriptional regulator nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were measured, along with an assessment of NF-κB mRNA stability. PAPOLG was significantly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected THP-1 macrophages. Genes subjected to alternative polyadenylation were enriched in immune pathways, and NF-κB emerged as a key regulator. Knockdown of PAPOLG promoted NF-κB mRNA degradation, while decreasing the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL6). Conversely, overexpression of PAPOLG stabilized NF-κB mRNA and enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 expression. PAPOLG contributes to the inflammatory response in SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages by stabilizing NF-κB mRNA. Thus, PAPOLG may be targeted to control COVID-19-related inflammation.">

        <tr id="Unresolved inflammation and fibrosis are the two key features of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive form of steatotic liver disease that can evolve into cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although innate immunity has been well studied in MASH, the role of CD4⁺ T cells remains underexplored despite their potential to coordinate immune responses by providing help to other immune cells, promoting inflammation, or regulating immune activity through effector and regulatory subsets. To better understand the role of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of MASH, we comprehensively characterized hepatic CD4+ T cells in murine and human MASH at a single-cell protein, transcriptional, and functional level. Mass cytometry and CITE-sequencing revealed a marked shift in intrahepatic CD4⁺ T-cell composition in MASH, with enrichment of Th1, regulatory, and cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells. Similar phenotypic changes were mirrored in the peripheral blood and validated in human MASH samples. Functional assays demonstrated increased production of IFNγ and TNFα by hepatic CD4⁺ T cells, highlighting their proinflammatory effector activity. Transcriptomic profiling identified Tnfrsf4 (OX40) upregulation in hepatic CD4⁺ T cells during MASH. Therapeutic blockade of the OX40L-OX40 axis reversed hepatic fibrosis and improved histologic disease scores in mice with established MASH, and also decreased inflammatory markers in a human ex vivo liver model. Together, these studies provide a proteogenomic single-cell atlas for hepatic CD4⁺ T cells and uncover a CD4⁺ T cell-dependent immunopathogenic circuit as a promising immunotherapeutic target to alleviate MASH and liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global health crisis, with many patients experiencing not only acute neurological and sensory symptoms but also persistent sensory abnormalities, commonly referred to as long COVID sequelae. The mechanisms underlying somatosensory abnormalities induced by SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein in pain regulation. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 N protein exacerbates pathological pain in mouse models of bone cancer, chemotherapy, neuropathic, and inflammatory, and promotes the chronification of acute inflammatory pain. We also identify a potential interaction between the N protein and Nav1.7 in dorsal root ganglion neurons from mice, monkeys, and humans. Furthermore, the N protein significantly increases Nav1.7 currents in dorsal root ganglion neurons from both mice and monkeys by delaying Nav1.7 inactivation without altering its expression or membrane trafficking. This modulation of Nav1.7 function by the N protein not only intensifies pain hypersensitivity but also prolongs the duration of pain, potentially facilitating the transition from acute to chronic pain. Our findings underscore the importance of vigilant management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with pathological pain and suggest potential therapeutic targets for mitigating COVID-19-related pain.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cerebral cytokinopathies are key examples of dysregulated cytokine responses. While mouse models with targeted production of individual cytokines have been pivotal in establishing a causal link between cytokines and disease— especially in the central nervous system—they often fail to replicate the complex inflammatory environments seen in various neuropathological conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, where multiple cytokines are upregulated. Methods To address this, we developed a novel mouse model, GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice, by combining transgenic mice with astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 (GFAP-IL6 mice) and IFN-α (GFAP-IFNlo mice). Results Our findings reveal that chronic, low-level production of IFN-α, below the typical disease-inducing threshold, significantly accelerates disease progression in GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice compared to GFAP-IL6 mice. The double transgenic mice exhibited progressive ataxia, persistent seizure-like episodes, and reduced survival. Remarkably, the clinical and pathological symptoms remained predominantly IL-6-driven and required the presence of adaptive immune cells. Conclusion In summary, we demonstrate that subclinical levels of IFN-α can markedly exacerbate IL-6-mediated neurological disease, suggesting that future studies, should consider the combined effects of IL-6 and IFN-α.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory route. Following intranasal instillation, VSV moves along the axons of olfactory sensory neurons to the olfactory bulb. While within the olfactory bulb the spread of the virus is controlled by microglia activation and the recruitment of peripheral leukocytes, some of the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we used mice with conditional deletions of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an adaptor for RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling. By selectively deleting MAVS in neurons, astrocytes, or long-lived myeloid cells, we discovered that RLR signaling specifically within brain-resident myeloid cells is crucial for protection against the virus. Infected mice with a MAVS deletion in these myeloid cells showed normal myeloid cell and leukocyte infiltration into the brain. However, the P2RY12+ microglia showed aberrant expression of genes involved in antigen cross-presentation. Furthermore, flow cytometry experiments revealed diminished MHC class I expression on MAVS deficient microglia. Moreover, CNS infiltrating CD8+ T cells had dysfunctional transcriptional profiles. Therefore, our findings indicate that during viral CNS infection, MAVS signaling in brain-resident myeloid cells, presumably microglia, is essential for antigen cross-presentation and the relicensing of protective, infiltrating CD8+ T cells.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and associated with systemic inflammation. Inflammation is an important process that follows infection and facilitates the body's innate immune response and repair of damaged tissue. Polyunsaturated fatty acids play an important role in the inflammatory process. These lipids can target transcription factors to modulate gene expression and protein function. Methods Here, we performed a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and immunoassays to evaluate whether differences in basal levels of different types of biomarkers can be detected in freshly frozen plasma samples from patients with and without COVID‐19. Results FAME analysis showed a decrease in arachidic acid and myristic acid, but an increase in caprylic acid, palmitic acid, and eicosenoic acid in the plasma of COVID‐19 patients compared to non‐COVID‐19 patients. Multiple chemokines including IP‐10, MCP‐1, and MIP‐1 beta were increased in the COVID‐19 group compared to the non‐COVID‐19 group. Similarly, cytokines including IL‐1 alpha and IL‐8, and cell adhesion and inflammatory response markers including ICAM‐1 and E‐selectin were greater in the plasma of COVID‐19 patients compared to non‐COVID‐19 patients. Conclusions A baseline signature of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids, cytokines, and chemokines present in the plasma after COVID‐19 viral infection may serve as biomarkers that can be useful in various applications including determination of severity of infection, indication of disease prognosis, and consideration for therapeutic options.">

        <tr id="Background Immunosenescence describes the gradual remodeling of immune responses, leading to disturbed immune homeostasis and increased susceptibility of older adults for infections, neoplasia and autoimmunity. Decline in cellular immunity is associated with intrinsic changes in the T cell compartment, but can be further pushed by age-related changes in cells regulating T cell immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent inhibitors of T cell activation and function, whose induction requires chronic inflammation. Since aging is associated with low grade inflammation (inflammaging) and increased myelopoiesis, age-induced changes in MDSC induction and function in relation to T cell immunity were analyzed. Results MDSC numbers and functions were compared between “healthy” young and old adults, who were negatively diagnosed for severe acute and chronic diseases known to induce MDSC accumulation. MDSCs were either isolated from peripheral blood or generated in vitro from blood-derived CD14 cells. Aging was associated with significantly increased MDSC numbers in the monocytic- (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSC subpopulations. MDSCs could be induced more efficiently from CD14 cells of old donors and these MDSCs inhibited CD3/28-induced T cell proliferation significantly better than MDSCs induced from young donors. Serum factors of old donors supported MDSC induction comparable to serum factors from young donors, but increased immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs was only achieved by serum from old donors. Elevated immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs from old donors was associated with major metabolic changes and increased intracellular levels of neutral and oxidized lipids known to promote immunosuppressive functions. Independent of age, MDSC-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation required direct MDSC– T cell contact. Besides their increased ability to inhibit activation-induced T cell proliferation, MDSCs from old donors strongly shift the immune response towards Th2 immunity and might thereby further contribute to impaired cell-mediated immunity during aging. Conclusions These results indicate that immunosenescence of innate immunity comprises accumulation and functional changes in the MDSC compartment, which directly impacts T cell functions and contribute to age-associated impaired T cell immunity. Targeting MDSCs during aging might help to maintain functional T cell responses and increase the chance of healthy aging.

        <tr id="Background A number of studies have shown that methylomes of blood cells of COVID-19 patients display infection-related methylation changes. Those methylation abnormalities were associated with clinical outcomes of the infection and, thus, can potentially be utilized as biomarkers in clinical COVID-19 management. However, a number of parameters need to be assessed, before a clinical use of a biomarker candidate is proposed, with the most important one being reproducible detection in independent target populations. Methods We benchmarked data reported in publications investigating genome-wide methylation changes occurring in blood cells during SARS-CoV-2 virus infection to assess potential applicability of these changes as biomarkers in clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Results We identified nine studies, in which infection-related genome-wide methylation changes in blood cells of COVID-19 patients were reported and associations of those changes with outcomes of the infection was assessed. Our benchmarking analysis showed that each of those studies included patients with different clinical characteristics and each study utilized different symptoms assessment criteria. Most importantly, no uniform data analysis methodologies to identify virus-related methylation changes were used in the analyzed studies. Consequently, analyzed studies, except for one, which was based on uniform data analysis workflow applied across independent patient cohorts, reported sufficiently uniform results that would allow to propose the use of the identified infection-related methylation changes as biomarkers for clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions Due to lack of coherence between studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 associated methylation changes in blood, the potential use of already reported methylation changes as biomarkers for clinical management of COVID-19 patients needs to be further assessed in rigorously controlled studies. At the same time unified data analysis framework appears to be the most critical in development of biomarkers associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and Monkeypox (Mpox) are viral infections that have similar modes of presentation, diagnosis and treatment strategies. Understanding their co-infection dynamics and immune response is important for public health policies. Aim This article aims to determine the relationship between dynamicity and immune response interactions between Mpox and COVID-19, focusing more on the implications for disease severity, viral transmission, and vaccine efficacy. Methodology An extensive literature review was conducted through electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science from the last decade (2014–2024) using keywords: COVID-19, Co-infections, Immune response, Monkeypox, and Vaccination. Results Several co-infections between COVID-19 and Mpox have been reported, especially a case from Florida, in the United States of America (USA), in Barcelona, Spain (a 56-year-old man who suffered both Mpox and COVID-19 and syphilis simultaneously, and from Italy (a 36-year-old male). Both COVID-19 and Mpox have been shown to have some effects on the immunity of a person, especially the innate system, which can occasionally produce inadvertent effects. A common factor that links the two diseases is the endoglycosidase named Heparanase (HPSE). Both COVID-19 and Mpox clinical features have bizarre severity and complications. The rising co-infection of COVID-19 and increased Mpox infection rate has led to the development of only approved vaccines JYNNEOS and COH04S1. Conclusion Global efforts such as adequate awareness campaigns through webinars, social media platforms, and research, including experimental studies, cohort studies, case series, etc., should be put in place to give more insights into both diseases. Such efforts should be backed up with good political will, adequate funding, the establishment of research facilities and interprofessional measures among the concerned countries and policymakers in the world.">

        <tr id="Introduction Microvascular injury is central to the pathophysiology of sepsis, but its interaction with the immune system in early infection is unclear. This study aimed to phenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from emergency department (ED) patients with suspected bacterial infection and correlate the results with microvascular changes. Methods This prospective observational study included 49 adult ED patients with suspected infection and 17 healthy controls. Capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions were measured by sublingual microscopy, while peripheral blood immune cell subsets were analyzed by deep flow cytometry. Results Network visualization of 72 diIerentially regulated parameters revealed specific changes in diIerent immune cell subsets. Innate immune changes included a functional diversion of monocytes towards pathogen defense and tissue repair, whereas adaptive immune changes included the development of CD4+ T cells with Th2-profile and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct immune endotypes: E1 with a suppressed immune response and higher disease severity, and E2 with an enhanced immune response and lower disease severity. Patients showed significant reductions in capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions, which were neither correlated in magnitude nor associated with endotypes. There was a strong association between damaged glycocalyx and several monocyte and T-cell subsets. This association was not observed for capillary density. Discussion We demonstrate that glycocalyx damage is associated with a unique immunological signature, distinct from functional capillary density. These findings provide a strong basis for future studies of immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction in infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction As of mid-2024, COVID-19 has affected over 676 million people worldwide, leading to more than 6.8 million deaths. Numerous studies have documented metabolic changes occurring during both the acute phase of the disease and the recovery phase, which, in some cases, contribute to the development of long COVID syndrome. Aims and methods In this study, we aimed to evaluate clinical, laboratory, and comprehensive metabolomic data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the second, third and fourth waves (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron). A targeted, fully quantitative metabolomics assay (TMIC MEGA Assay) was used to measure 529 metabolites and lipids in plasma samples. The metabolomic profiles of these patients were compared according to different and relevant factors impacting COVID-19 outcome, such as age, sex, comorbidities, and vaccination status. Results Among the 21 classes of compounds evaluated in this study, amino acids and lipids were the most dysregulated when comparing age, sex, comorbidities, vaccination status, and the different epidemiological waves. This is the most comprehensive analysis in Mexico providing absolute quantitative data for 529 metabolites and lipids measured in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which could be used to monitor their metabolic status and clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection or with long COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="Immune cell activation is a feature of COVID-19, that leads to cytokine storm which causes neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, related to psychiatric symptoms due to the depletion of neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate which play a major role in adult neurogenesis. ACE2 receptors are expressed in the hippocampus and decreased neurogenesis in this region is a major factor behind the neuropsychiatric disorders. SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain indirectly through neuroinflammation and altered neurochemical signaling and even mild COVID-19 infections can lead to sustained microglial activation, which disrupts neural networks and impairs cognitive function. The long COVID-19 may be associated with cognitive dysfunction in those who recovered and immunological response may affect synaptic pruning and reduced anterior cingulate cortex volume at one year after COVID-19. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or PASC, commonly known as Long COVID is a significant public health concern and "brain fog" is one of the most debilitating cognitive impairments, affecting memory, concentration, and executive function occurring in 88% of cases. Brain fog may be linked to persistent changes in neurotransmitter levels, particularly involving dopamine and serotonin which play an essential role in cognition, attention, and emotional regulation. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the chemokine CCL11, is linked to cognitive impairments in patients with persistent symptoms. Neuroprotective agents that support neuronal health, such as antioxidants and mitochondrial enhancers and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic and direct current enhance cortical excitability are investigated in cognitive recovery. Evaluation of the currently predominant VUM (a Variant Under Monitoring), LP.8.1, and the most recently designated NB.1.8.1, is increasing as 10.7% of global sequences reported recently due to minor mutations in spike protein. In May 2025, TAG-CO-VAC (Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine) advised that the monovalent vaccines targeting against JN.1 or KP.2 lineages are highly appropriate.">

The current retrospective cohort study of 182 patients, with and without COVID‐19 and diabetes, analyzed leftover blood specimens for RNA sequencing and chemokine/cytokine, ACE2/DPP‐IV concentrations. After analysis, 14 223 genes had sufficient hits; 18 genes and 431 genes were differentially expressed between patients with and without COVID‐19 and patients with and without diabetes, respectively. Both analyses had differentially expressed five genes, GRASP, KRT8, MYZAP, PRKG1, and SMIM24. DPP‐IV concentrations were statistically lower in COVID‐19 patients versus non‐COVID‐19, but no significant differences in chemokine/cytokine expression and ACE2 concentrations were detected. This study provides insight into altered gene expression patterns in individuals with COVID‐19 with and without diabetes mellitus and highlights potential markers for severe disease and pathways for treatment targets.">

        <tr id="Rat post-mitotic septal neurons, engineered to reversibly proliferate and arrest under physiological conditions, can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine representative independent cDNA libraries were made to evaluate global arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses, e.g., upregulated interferon (β-IFN) RNA, that were previously identified in normal uninfected and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent (CJ) infected septal neurons. This reversible cell model encompassed a non-productive latent (CJ−) and a highly infectious (CJ + , 10 logs/gm) state. Arrest of normal uninfected neurons upregulated a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts and known neuronal differentiation transcripts (e.g., Neuregulin-1, GDF6 and Prnp). As expected, many activated IFN innate immune genes were simultaneously upregulated (e.g., OAS1, ISG20, CD80, cytokines, chemokines and complement) along with clusterin (CLU) that binds misfolded proteins. Arrest of latently infected CJ− cells induced even more profound global transcript differences. CJ+ cells markedly downregulated the anti-proliferative controls seen in arrested normal cells. CJ+ infection also suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ infection. In contrast, IFN and cytokine/chemokine pathways were strongly upregulated. Analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection enhances and expands anti-viral responses; 3) non-productive latent infection can epigenetically imprint many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. This rare cell model of latent infection is fundamental for interrogating triggers of late onset disease that are also relevant for Alzheimer’s Disease. Peripheral human blood and intestinal myeloid cells that are latently infected may also be conditionally stimulated in vitro to produce CJ+ linked diagnostic transcripts.">

        <tr id="The interplay between comorbidities and viral infections is a critical factor that influences disease severity and outcomes. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one such comorbidity that significantly elevates the risk of severe viral infection from coronaviruses, namely, SARS-CoV-2. DM is characterized by either a lack of insulin production (type 1 diabetes) or insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes), both of which contribute to a state of hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia significantly promotes chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, which put diabetics at an elevated risk of critical health outcomes. Additionally, diabetes is hypothesized to amplify viral titers during infection by promoting the expression of the viral entry receptor ACE2 and providing a favorable cellular energy environment for viral replication. This review focuses on explaining the mechanisms that link diabetics with more severe COVID-19 disease and exploring some of the mechanisms that contribute to the phenomenon where COVID-19 can promote new-onset diabetes. By highlighting the interconnections between diabetes and COVID-19, this review aims to emphasize the implications that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has had on metabolic health.">

        <tr id="Immune function declines with age, leading to increased vulnerability of the elderly to viral infectious pathogens. The mechanisms by which aging negatively impacts the innate and adaptive immune system, leading to enhanced susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens, remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we utilized a mouse model of infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a virus that can infect the lungs and lead to pneumonia, a rare but serious health concern in the elderly. Following intranasal inoculation of young (6 weeks), adult (36 weeks), and aged mice (68 weeks) with HSV-1 (KOS strain) we: (i) compared the local and systemic immune responses to infection in young, adult, and aged mice, and (ii) correlated the level and type of immune responses to protection against HSV-1 infection and disease. Compared to young and adult mice, aged mice displayed: (i) increased activation of epithelial cells with a decreased expression of TLR3; (ii) increased activation of dendritic cells with increased expression of MHC-I, MHC-II, and CD80/86; (iii) decreased production of type-I interferons; (iv) delayed production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs; and (v) impairment frequencies of functional HSV-specific CD107+IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells associated with the increased incidence of viral infection and disease. These findings suggest that age-related impairments in innate and adaptive immune responses may exacerbate respiratory viral infections and disease in the elderly.">

        <tr id="Accumulating clinical evidence suggests an intricate relationship between severe COVID‐19 and preexisting metabolic complications, which share some metabolic dysregulations, including hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia. However, the potential role of these metabolic risk factors in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and entry factor expression remains unknown. Here we report the implication of hyperglycaemia in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and therapy. Hyperglycaemia, instead of hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia, can significantly induce the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry factors (Ace2, Tmprss2, Tmprss4, Furin and Nrp1) in liver cells, but not in lung and pancreatic cells, which is attenuated by mTOR inhibition. Correspondingly, pathological glucose levels promote SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into cultured hepatocytes in pseudovirus cell systems. Conversely, representative glucose‐lowering drugs (metformin, dapagliflozin, sitagliptin and exenatide) are able to diminish the enhancement of entry factor expression and SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in cultured hepatocytes under pathological glucose conditions. Intriguingly, SARS‐CoV‐2 entry factors are increased in the livers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes patients. These results define hyperglycaemia as a key susceptibility factor for hepatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and provide insights into the clinical application of glucose‐lowering therapies in COVID‐19 patients under comorbid hyperglycaemia conditions.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common non-infectious inflammatory CNS disease, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and focal demyelinated lesions. Traditionally considered an autoimmune disease, MS is driven by the immune system's attack on CNS myelin, resulting in cumulative disability. However, conventional anti-inflammatory treatments often fail to prevent progressive deterioration, particularly in the absence of overt inflammation, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis. Recent research has revealed a more complex disease mechanism involving both peripheral immune responses and intrinsic CNS factors, with glial cells playing a central role. Persistent inflammation in MS is associated with mixed active/inactive lesions dominated by microglia and astrocyte dysregulation. These glial populations exhibit maladaptive activation, contributing to failed remyelination and ongoing neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations as well as aging further exacerbate glial dysfunction, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation and damage. Emerging evidence suggests that the interplay between peripheral immune cells and glial populations and the potential dual-use nature of molecular tools shared by the immune system and CNS disrupts homeostatic signaling, leading to a loss of tissue integrity. This review synthesizes findings on glial cell biology in MS, with a focus on microglia and astrocytes, while addressing their roles in demyelination, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. The limitations of animal models, particularly EAE, in replicating the complexity of MS are also addressed. Finally, critical questions are outlined to guide future research into glial pathology and to identify novel therapeutic approaches targeting progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Recent discoveries highlight angiogenin (ANG) and 5’ tRNA-derived fragments as key factors in stress response and cell survival. To explore their role in asthma pathogenesis, particularly in severe cases, we evaluated the levels of ANG and 5’ tRNA halves (tRHs) derived from tRNA Glu (5'-tRH Glu: tRF-32-87R8WP9N1EWJM) and tRNA Gly (5’-tRH Gly: tRF-30-PNR8YP9LON4V), two abundant tRHs in the respiratory tract, in sputum and blood samples from asthmatic patients. We found ANG expression is significantly increased in circulating leukocytes from severe asthma patients but not in sputum infiltrates. On the contrary, tRHs levels showed significant alterations only in extracellular compartments. Both tRHs were downregulated in the plasma of asthmatic patients, while elevated 5’-tRH Gly levels were observed in severe sputum samples, indicating tissue-specific roles in disease pathology. Additionally, tRH expression in leukocytes was negatively associated with the disrupted corticosteroid response in asthmatic patients. Altered levels of ANG and 5’-tRH Glu and 5’-tRH Gly were further validated in an in vitro model of pollutant-aggravated, allergen-stimulated macrophages. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the role of ANG and tRHs in asthma pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as novel markers for asthma phenotyping.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY The mechanisms by which viruses enter host cells are crucial for their ability to infect and cause disease, serving as major targets for both host immune responses and therapeutic strategies. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry process is primarily driven by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, in conjunction with the activity of endosomal cathepsin L and the serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, recent scientific advances have expanded our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, uncovering alternative receptors and novel cofactors that may enhance viral tropism and adaptability. Given the critical role of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in mediating host cell entry, it has become a primary target for prevention and therapeutic strategies. However, the continuous spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of S protein variants that may potentially confer a fitness advantage or modify key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology, such as transmissibility, infectivity, antigenicity, and/or pathogenicity, posing significant challenges to the efficacy of current interventions. In this review, we provide an updated and comprehensive overview of the latest advances in SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways and molecular mechanisms, exploring their implications for antiviral drug discovery, vaccine design, and the development of other biomedical strategies while addressing the challenges posed by the ongoing evolution of the virus.">

        <tr id="Bacterial meningitis (BM) requires rapid intervention, especially in immunocompromised populations. Understanding early immune responses is crucial, as they precede clinical symptoms; however, comprehensive studies remain limited. This research investigates immune-related genes to improve BM diagnosis and treatment. Mendelian randomization, differential gene expression analysis, and co-expression network analysis identified key genes associated with BM. Immune cell ratio calculations and infiltration analyses demonstrated altered immune cell proportions. Spearman correlation analysis revealed relationships between gene expression and immune cell types. Single-cell RNA sequencing, gene set enrichment analysis, and pseudotime analysis explored changes in gene expression and cell proportions across disease stages, focusing on the roles of key genes in specific immune cells. Ring Finger Protein 144B (RNF144B) was identified as a risk gene predominantly expressed in monocytes and neutrophils. Conversely, FYN Proto-Oncogene (FYN) was identified as a protective gene primarily associated with NKT cells. During BM onset, increased RNF144B expression positively correlated with elevated neutrophil levels, while reduced FYN expression correlated with decreased NKT cell levels. During remission and recovery, RNF144B expression and neutrophil proportions decreased, whereas FYN expression and NKT cell proportions increased. NKT cells appeared to play a protective role, with FYN potentially modulating T-cell receptor function in these cells, thereby reducing BM risk. RNF144B and FYN expression exhibit opposing trends in peripheral blood across BM stages, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring. These findings provide a valuable reference for early intervention strategies and personalized treatment approaches tailored to specific disease stages in the clinic.

Methods Testes were analyzed under light and electron microscope. Immunolocalization of human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) and viral proteins (spike and nucleocapsid) were evaluated in association with the expression of viral recognition receptor, Rigi. Steroidogenesis was evaluated by the expression of steroidogenic factor-1 (Sf1), and the immunolocalization of steroidogenic proteins and testosterone. Pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines, macrophages (CD68 and CD163) and macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected by immunolocalization and Western blot. The expression of lipid metabolism genes (Srebp, Dgat1 and Scarb1) were investigated by RT-qPCR. Results In the infected animals, the Leydig cells showed enhanced immunolocalization of hACE2, spike and nucleocapsid. The expression of Rigi, pro-inflammatory cytokines and number of macrophages increased, confirming viral infection. Sf1 expression, steroidogenic proteins and testosterone were reduced whereas the expression of Dgat1, Srebp and Scarb1 increased. Lipid droplets-enriched Leydig cells and viral particles in lipids were observed. The infected Leydig cells also showed enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines immunolabeling. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 infects Leydig cells, activates its immune response and impairs steroidogenesis. The virus uses the steroidogenic machinery and induces lipid metabolism pathways for its survival and replication in these cells. These findings support the low testosterone and HDL levels in men with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic with far-reaching impacts on human activities. Moreover, direct viral damage and uncontrolled inflammation have been proposed as contributing factors to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is also well recognized for its capability to trigger and modulate the host’s innate immune system by attaching to bacterial substances. Nevertheless, the pandemic has further emphasized the critical role of an effective host immune response in controlling viral infection and highlighted the detrimental effect of immune dysregulation. This study aimed to assess plasma levels of LBP and inflammatory biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2 patients with different malnutrition status and severity levels. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh from December 2020 to December 2021. A total of 166 SARS-CoV-2 patients were recruited including 80 critical and 86 non-critical patients. Medical history, anthropometrical parameters, disease outcome information, and relevant biochemical parameters were extracted from medical records. Plasma samples were collected to test for LBP and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, nutritional risk was assessed by the Nutrition Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002) tool. Results: This cross-sectional study found no significant differences in LBP levels between critical and non-critical SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, LBP levels significantly correlated with IL-10, TNF-α and IL-6/IL-10 levels (Spearman’s rho = 0.430, 0.276 and −0.397 respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study confirmed the elevated inflammatory cytokines in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and their association with disease severity and malnutrition. These findings may support the mechanism of gut inflammation in order to develop new interventions that lower inflammatory biomarkers, disease severity, and aid in SARS-CoV-2 prevention and management.">

Investigating the altered pathogenicity of coexisting microorganisms and their influence on disease progression provides valuable insights for the development of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against infectious processes. This article provides a comprehensive review of current literature on viral-bacterial interactions in the context of respiratory infections, their pathogenic mechanisms, and significance during the COVID-19 pandemic. It synthesizes recent findings on how SARS-CoV-2 influences mucosal immunity, facilitates secondary bacterial infections through immune modulation, and impacts disease severity and clinical outcomes in co-infected individuals. Special attention is given to the molecular and cellular pathways mediating virus-bacteria interactions, including host receptor modulation, cytokine and interferon response alterations, and disruptions to the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiota. The epidemiological trends observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including shifts in the prevalence of common respiratory pathogens and the emergence of new co-infection patterns, are also considered. Understanding the dynamic interplay between viral and bacterial pathogens is crucial for optimizing patient management, improving outcomes, and guiding effective public health interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction SARS-CoV-2’s continued global health impact underscores the importance of ongoing pathogenesis research. Insights into the host’s first line of defense against severe COVID-19 identify actionable biomarkers, informing disease management or therapeutics. Yet, the innate immune response, including cytokines, chemokines, adenosine deaminases (ADAs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), relevant to COVID-19 remain incompletely characterized. Methods Peripheral blood was longitudinally collected between May 2020 and March 2021 from COVID-19 hospitalized adults (N = 79) and healthy controls (HCs) (N = 14; not tested, assumed COVID-negative, no viral exposure or symptoms). Heparinized blood was fractionated for plasma cryopreservation and in vitro whole blood TLR-stimulation employing TLR-3, -4, and -7/8 agonists. Post-stimulation culture supernatants were analyzed using multiplex and enzymatic assays. Results Upon hospitalization, plasma concentrations of IFNγ, IL-6, CXCL10, and ADAs were significantly upregulated compared to convalescent time points and HCs. Participants with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs concentrations upon admission. Plasma cytokines, chemokines, and ADAs were positively correlated and associated with distinct temporal patterns. TLR-stimulated cell cultures from patients produced reduced IFNα2, IFNγ, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70 compared to HCs or later time points. Conclusion Higher plasma concentrations of IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs at admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Reduced TLR-mediated IFNα2, IFNγ, and IL-12p70 production suggests COVID dampens Th1-polarizing innate immune responses, providing insight into immunological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction 1-5% of all patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), even those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, continue to have symptoms after initial recovery. Symptoms associated with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PACS) include, among others, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and cognitive dysfunction. Since the dysregulated immune response appears to be caused by the sustained activation of certain immune cells, including monocytes, and the release of specific cytokines, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PACS disease on monocyte subpopulations. Methods Twenty-two healthy and thirty-two patients with PACS were included into this study. We performed blood gas analysis and measured hematological parameters from peripheral blood of PACS patients and compared them with healthy donors. Surface markers to identify monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results PACS patients had higher numbers of intermediate and CD56+ monocytes, whereas the numbers of total monocytes, classical and non-classical monocytes were normal compared to healthy donors. Comparison of patients with and without fatigue, cough, and dyspnea showed no difference in monocyte subset frequencies. However, patients with cognitive dysfunction had increased numbers of non-classical monocytes compared to patients without this symptom. Discussion This suggests a disturbed homeostasis of the monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with PACS.">

        <tr id="Objective Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by infection, characterized by high clinical heterogeneity and complex immunopathological mechanisms. Immune dysregulation plays a central role in its progression. This study aims to investigate the compositional changes of immune cells, characteristics of intercellular communication, and potential regulatory mechanisms of N⁶-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in sepsis, with a particular focus on the functional remodeling of platelets. Methods This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE167363 dataset) from sepsis patients with m6A methylation sequencing data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Through systematic analysis, we compared the differences in immune cell composition, developmental trajectories, intercellular communication, and m6A modifications among healthy controls, survivors, and non-survivors, and further screened for key m6A-regulated target genes. Results The analysis revealed that platelets gradually accumulated during the progression of sepsis, while B cells, T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exhibited a trend toward platelet-like phenotypic remodeling. Cell–cell communication analysis showed a marked decline in communication strength among immune cells as the disease worsened, particularly a significant weakening of the APP–CD74 signaling pathway between platelets and B cells, indicating impaired immune network synergy. m⁶A methylation sequencing revealed distinct remodeling of m⁶A peaks and dysregulation of related regulatory factors in non-survivors. Further integrative analysis identified RPA1 as a key m⁶A-regulated target gene, whose expression was closely associated with APP and co-regulated by multiple m6A-modifying factors. Conclusion This study reveals disruptions in immune cell interactions and an m6A-dependent mechanism of platelet functional remodeling during sepsis progression. The identification of the key target gene RPA1 offers new insights into the immunopathological mechanisms of sepsis and lays a theoretical foundation for future precision interventions and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Human macrophages (MΦs) reside in tissues and develop tissue-specific identities. While studies in mice have identified molecular signatures for site-specific MΦ differentiation, we know less about the transcriptional profiles of human MΦs in distinct sites, including mucosal tissues and lymphoid organs during homeostasis and activation. Here, we use multimodal single-cell sequencing and ex vivo stimulation assays to define tissue signatures for populations of human MΦs isolated from lungs, small intestine, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes obtained from individual organ donors. Our results reveal distinct tissue-adapted gene and protein profiles of metabolic, adhesion, and immune interaction pathways, which are specific to MΦs and not monocytes isolated from the same sites. These signatures exhibit homology to murine MΦs from the same sites. Tissue-adapted MΦs remained responsive to polarizing cytokine stimuli ex vivo, with upregulation of expected transcripts and secreted proteins, while retaining tissue-specific profiles. Together, our findings show how human MΦ identity is coupled to their site of residence for mucosal and lymphoid organs and is intrinsically maintained during activation and polarization.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves dysregulation of innate immune cells including monocytes, especially in progressive MS. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are essential for fatty acid transport and metabolism in multiple cell types. FABP7, a brain-FABP, maintains metabolic function in astrocytes and neural stem cells, but the effect of FABP7 on monocytes is unknown. Here we find elevated levels of FABP7 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with secondary progressive MS. Elevated serum FABP7 levels positively correlate with higher disability scores, brain lesion volumes, and lower brain volumes. FABP7 levels are increased in astrocytes from MS postmortem brain lesion. Mechanistically, in vitro treatment of FABP7 induces CD16, CD80 and IL-1β expression in monocytes via increased glycolysis. FABP7-induced gene expression reflects enhanced inflammation, chemotaxis and glucose metabolism in monocytes. In conclusion, we find that FABP7 induces pro-inflammatory profiles in monocytes, correlates with disability and represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Cognitive dysfunction represents one of the most persistent and disabling features of Long COVID, yet its molecular underpinnings remain incompletely understood. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term neurocognitive sequelae. Key processes include persistent neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial dysfunction, immune dysregulation, and neuroendocrine imbalance. Microglial activation and cytokine release (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) promote synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury, while activation of inflammasomes such as NLRP3 amplifies CNS inflammation. Vascular abnormalities, including microthrombosis and BBB leakage, facilitate the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and neurotoxic mediators. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction and reduced vagal tone further exacerbate systemic inflammation and autonomic imbalance. Biomarkers such as GFAP, NFL, IL-6, and S100B have been associated with both neuroinflammation and cognitive symptoms. Notably, transcriptomic signatures in Long COVID overlap with those observed in Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting shared pathways involving tau dysregulation, oxidative stress, and glial reactivity. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for identifying at-risk individuals and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. This review underscores the need for longitudinal research and integrative biomarker analysis to elucidate the molecular trajectory of cognitive impairment in Long COVID.">

        <tr id="Background Pathological inflammation with a loss of synaptic integrity and function has been implicated in HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Although therapeutics exist to increase the lifespan of people living with HIV (PLWH), they are not effective at preventing neuroinflammation and HIV induced neuronal damage persists. In this study, we investigate the ephrin-B/EphB axis, which regulates inflammation, in post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and experimental models in order to assess its potential role in HIV induced neuroinflammation. Methods We analyze mRNA samples of post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and uninfected controls obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) and, for comparison, of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Follow-up experiments employ mouse brain tissue and in vitro models, including immortalized human microglia, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mixed neuroglial cell cultures, cellular and molecular interference, functional and multiplex assays, immunofluorescence and mRNA sequencing to examine the role of the ephrin-B/EphB axis in neuroinflammation and the associated neurotoxicity. Results Using qRT-PCR we find increased expression of EphB2 in post-mortem brain of PLWH, and detect a correlation with pro-viral DNA, viral RNA and an inverse correlation with abstract executive function and verbal fluency. Increased expression of ephrin-B/EphB at mRNA and protein level is also observed in brains of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV suggesting the upregulation can be driven, at least in part, by expression of viral gp120 envelope protein and a type I interferon, IFNβ. Additionally, we find induction of ephrin-B1 expression in microglia following activation by IFNβ. Given the previously reported impact of EphB2 on inflammation in the periphery, the functional role of EphB2-mediated ephrin-B reverse signaling on microglia is assessed for a pro-inflammatory and anti-viral signature. We find that EphB2 treated microglia secrete inflammatory and anti-viral factors but also exert contact-independent neurotoxicity. Finally, knockdown of microglial ephrin-B1, an EphB2 binding partner, shows a partial alleviation of the microglial pro-inflammatory signature and neurotoxicity. Conclusion Our study suggests that elevated EphB2, and its reverse signaling through ephrin-B1 in microglia contribute to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in neuroHIV.

        <tr id="Background Monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in phagocytic reactions, which potentially play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Imbalance of these cells in peripheral blood has proven to affect not only innate but also adaptive immunity. It is possible that a search for strategies to restore monocyte activity could be a major step in achieving immune control over COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes and neutrophils, and COVID-19 severity, to assess the effects of a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent on phagocytosis parameters in in-hospital COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods The study included 105 adult patients with moderate COVID-19, who had been hospitalized in 2020–2021 and treated in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. All patients were divided into two groups: in Group 1 patients received standard treatment and Immunovac VP4 therapeutic vaccine, a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent as add-on therapy from Day 1 of hospitalization; in Group 2 patients did not receive any add-on treatment. The study parameters included C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), SpO2, lung involvement on chest computer tomography (CT) scan, and phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood leukocytes based on the absorption activity (AA) of monocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes against S. аureus). The parameters were assessed at 1, 14 and 30 days. Results Based on a cluster analysis of the clinical findings and the results of diagnostic tests obtained on admission, the patients were divided into 2 clusters: cluster 1 including patients with a more severe disease (n = 34) and cluster 2 including patients with a less severe disease (n = 71). Cluster 1 patients had higher levels of CRP (20.1 vs. 2.2 mg/mL, p < 0.001), AST (32.9 vs. 26.2 U/L, p = 0.003), lower SpO2 (94% vs. 96%, p < 0,001) and more extensive lung involvement on chest CT scan (35% vs. 12%, p < 0,001). There was a statistically significant direct correlation between blood monocyte AA and SpO2 (p = 0.04), an inverse correlation between monocyte AA and CRP (p = 0.003) and the extent of lung involvement on CT scan (p = 0.05). In less severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 2), no statistically significant correlation was observed. In more severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 1), there was a rise in monocyte AA on day 30 of hospitalization both in the control group (from 86.6 to 92.2, p = 0.03) and the main group, who received Immunovac VP4 add-on therapy (from 87.3 to 98.3, p = 0.05). However, the patients who received the immunostimulating agent, had higher monocyte PI than the controls, without the immunostimulant (p = 0.05). Patients from cluster 1 who were given Immunovac VP4 had higher SpO2 levels (98% vs. 97%, p = 0.01) than those who had received only the standard treatment. Discussion Blood monocyte AA correlates with COVID-19 severity: patients with less severe disease have higher AA and those with more severe illness have lower AA. The standard treatment, combined with Immunovac VP4 enhances phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes, which is associated with a more marked increase in SpO2, especially in more severe patients.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. The virus primarily spreads through person-to-person contact via aerosols and droplets, contributing to high case numbers and related morbidities. SARS-CoV-2 targets the respiratory tract, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as those with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a life-threatening genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to impaired respiratory function and recurrent severe respiratory symptoms. Despite their potential vulnerability, CF patients have shown a lower incidence of severe COVID-19, suggesting protective factors against SARS-CoV-2. Differential expression of the ACE2 receptor, crucial for viral entry, and other host factors, such as TMPRSS2, may play a role in this resistance to SARS-CoV-2. Analyzing the genomics and transcriptomics profiles of CF patients could provide insights into potential resistance mechanisms. The potential resistance mechanisms include blood and extracellular ATP levels, a deleted/dysfunctional CFTR gene, ACE and ACE2 regulation and expression, ACE and ACE2 polymorphism effects, host proteins and SARS-CoV-2 interactions, and SMN1 and ACE/ACE2 interactions. This review discusses the underlying factors and potential resistance mechanisms contributing to CF patients’ responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review provides an opportunity to further investigate future therapy and research through understanding the underlying potential resistance mechanisms exhibited by CF patients against SARS-CoV-2, including ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms.">

        <tr id="Complement dysregulation and immune hyperactivation are pivotal factors contributing to the mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Engineered Antibody-like proteins (ALPs) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are engineered to address immune dysregulation in COVID-19. In this study, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41, two such ALPs, are developed using cDNA display technology. These ALPs demonstrate strong binding affinity for the spike protein and effectively inhibit its interaction with ACE2 and several C-type lectins, including MBL, DC-SIGN, and L-SIGN. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses reveal that Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 suppress complement activation via the lectin pathway, reduce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and attenuate hyper-inflammatory responses. In mouse models, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 significantly mitigate inflammation, NETosis, and lung tissue damage induced by the spike protein. These results suggest that these ALPs hold promise as therapeutic candidates for alleviating SARS-CoV-2-induced immune dysfunction, with the potential to reduce severe COVID-19 outcomes and long-term sequelae. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting spike protein-mediated immune modulation as an innovative approach to combat COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: COVID-19 has been associated with a wide range of immune responses, including the production of autoantibodies, particularly in severe cases. This study investigates the IgG autoantibody responses in patients with varying severities of COVID-19 infection and compares these responses with vaccinated individuals. Methods: We utilized proteomic profiling to analyze autoantibody reactivity against a broad spectrum of proteins expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets in serum samples from severe and moderate COVID-19 patients, as well as vaccinated individuals who received the inactivated CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccine. Results: Our findings indicate a marked increase in the diversity and number of IgG autoantibodies targeting intracellular and membrane-associated proteins in severe COVID-19 cases, compared to those with moderate cases of the disease. The autoantibody response in severe cases was found to primarily target proteins involved in immune cell activation, signaling, and differentiation, suggesting potential pathways of immune dysregulation and autoimmunity. In contrast, vaccinated individuals did not exhibit similar autoantibody reactivity, pointing to a more controlled immune response post-vaccination. Notably, no significant autoimmune responses were detected in the vaccinated cohort, suggesting that the inactivated vaccine does not induce autoreactive IgG. These findings align with the established safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines, especially in comparison to the heightened immune dysregulation observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The absence of a significant autoantibody response in vaccinated individuals supports the notion that vaccines, while inducing robust immune activation, do not typically trigger autoimmunity in healthy individuals. Conclusions: Our study underscores the importance of distinguishing between the immune responses triggered by infection and vaccination and highlights the need for the continued monitoring of autoimmune responses in severe COVID-19 cases. Future research should focus on the long-term persistence and clinical relevance of these autoantibodies, particularly in individuals with pre-existing autoimmune conditions or genetic predispositions.">

        <tr id="The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has plunged the world into a major crisis of overwhelming morbidity and mortality and emerged various mutant strains. Patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 develop post-acute COVID syndrome, commonly known as long COVID (LC), lasting up to 12 weeks or even longer. The mechanism has yet to be clarified. COVID-19 pseudovirus is a suitable model to understand the infection of the COVID-19 virus to cells, which is suitable to see the acute change in cells owing to its one-time infection and inactivation. The ACE2-293T cell infected by COVID-19 pseudovirus was used in this study. After the infection and removal of the pseudovirus, high amounts of ferrous ions were accumulated in mitochondria and then released into the cytosol. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was formed and caused mitochondrial dysfunction. To evaluate the effect of nutritional strategy on ferrous ion accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, lactoferrin, Q10 and Echinacea purpurea extract (EPE) were used in this study. Results showed that lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE could improve mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing the accumulation of ferrous ions and ROS in the mitochondria. HPLC analysis showed that EPE contained rich caffeic acid, and it also showed perfect improvement in mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, cells infected with pseudovirus could increase the accumulation of ferrous ions and ROS in mitochondria and be released into the cytosol after removing pseudovirus, thereby causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE were an effective nutritional strategy to suppress ferrous ion accumulation, ROS formation and advanced mitochondrial dysfunction.">

Using SARS-CoV-derived ssRNA sequences, we modeled age-dependent immune responses in mice. Aged mice exhibited higher mortality and severe lung inflammation upon viral ssRNA challenge, mirroring clinical observations. We uncovered a pre-existing inflammatory state in aged mice, characterized by elevated baseline levels of specific immune cells and cytokines correlating with poor outcomes. Age-related immune dysfunction stemmed from impaired IRF7 signaling and defective SNARE-mediated cytokine secretion in CD11b+ cells. Notably, the adoptive transfer of young CD11b+ cells to aged mice exposed to SARS-CoV2 ssRNA reduced mortality, alleviated lung inflammation, and normalized cytokine profiles. These findings provide insights into age-related immune dysregulation during viral challenges and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for severe COVID-19 in the elderly.">

        <tr id="Increased iron levels, common in neurodegenerative diseases, correlate with disease severity, suggesting a role in the pathological process. Recently, efforts have been made to understand the role of iron in cerebral inflammatory processes. Employing astrocyte cell models of genetic neurodegenerative pathologies characterized by iron imbalance, such as the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorders, can provide valuable insights into astrocytes reactivity, a pivotal process in brain inflammation. Specifically, we employed human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes from Neuroferritinopathy, where iron accumulation is primary. After confirming iron accumulation and the deregulation of proteins involved in iron management, we observed that at 35 days since the beginning of differentiation, the elevated iron levels not only trigger ferroptosis but also place the astrocytes in a reactive state. This is evident in the higher extracellular concentrations of IL-6, IL-1β, and glutamate, along with changes in morphology, genes, and proteins involved in astrocyte reactivity. Interestingly, by day 60, IL-6 and IL-1β levels drop below those of the controls, and we observe a reversal in most of the factors considered. Moreover, at day 60, it is possible to observe not only increased senescence but also ferroptosis. These findings demonstrate that iron plays a primary role in inducing astrocyte reactivity.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic infection that affects the central nervous system. However, its high infectivity makes comprehensive research with the active virus challenging. Here, we use virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type mice and in mice that express the human tau protein. VLP exposure elicits changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings in primary somatosensory and motor cortices reveal substantial short-term increases in cortical activity in VLP-injected mice, with increased stimulus-evoked activity in both genotypes and elevated spontaneous activity in the human tau genotype only. Vehicle-injected human tau mice also show increases in cortical activity patterns. Over the following weeks, activity metrics partially subside but do not completely return to baseline levels. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. Middle-aged human tau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background and overexpression of the tau protein, exhibit more severe pathobiology and may be at risk for more adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="Post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), i.e., long-lasting pathologies subsequent to infections that do not properly resolve, have both a common core and a broad diversity of manifestations. PAIS include a group of core symptoms (pathological fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disorders and pain) accompanied by a large set of diverse symptoms. Core and diverse additional symptoms, which can persist for years, exhibiting periods of relapses and remissions, usually start suddenly after an apparently common infection. PAIS display highly variable clinical features depending on the nature of the initial pathogen, and to an even larger extent, on the diversity of preexisting individual terrains in which PAIS are rooted. In a first part, I discuss biological issues related to the persistence of microbial antigens, dysregulated immune responses, reactivation of latent viruses, different potential self-sustained inflammatory loops, mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic disorders in the tryptophan- kynurenin pathway (TKP) with impact on serotonin, and consequences of a dysfunctional bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain axis. The second part deals with the nervous system dependence of PAIS. I rely on the concept of interoception, the process by which the brain senses, integrates and interprets signals originating from within the body, and sends feebacks aimed at maintaining homeostasis. Interoception is central for understanding the origin of fatigue, dysautonomia, dysfunctioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and its relation with stress, inflammation or depression. I propose that all individual predispositions leading to self-sustained vicious circles constitute building blocks that can self-assemble in many possible ways, to give rise to both core and diverse features of PAIS. A useful discrimination between different PAIS subtypes should be obtained with a composite profiling including biomarkers, questionnaires and functional tests so as to take into account PAIS multidimensionality.">

        <tr id="Background The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on pituitary function remains unclear, particularly during the acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Case presentation We report the case of a 40-year-old man with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) who was admitted for the evaluation of anterior pituitary function. The patient developed mild COVID-19 during the hospitalization, when we inadvertently observed rapid activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis prior to the onset of fever. At the estimated onset of COVID-19, the patient’s body temperature and the serum level of C-reactive protein remained within normal limits, whereas plasma ACTH levels drastically elevated, and subsequently, serum cortisol levels remain consistently high throughout the day, resulting in increased urinary free cortisol. The serum levels of several cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-1RA, IL-6, and TNF-α, were also significantly elevated compared to those in the non-infected state. Acute suppression of thyroid and gonadal functions was observed approximately one day after the HPA axis activation. Conclusions These findings illustrate the rapid response of the HPA axis to inflammatory factors in the early-stage COVID-19, which may have important implications for understanding the initial host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Although lipid metabolism dysregulation has been implicated in sepsis pathogenesis, how lipid biosynthesis, particularly mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), leads to dendritic cell (DC) immunoparalysis remains unclear. Methods Intracellular lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil Red O and BODIPY staining. Gene and protein expression levels were analyzed via qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. SREBF1 activity was modulated using genetic knockout and siRNA silencing. DC phenotype and CD4+ T cell proliferation were evaluated using flow cytometry and co-culture assays. Cytokine secretion was measured using ELISA. Results In a cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis model, we observed increased lipid biosynthesis and significantly elevated SREBF1 expression in spleen DCs. Increased SREBF1 expression suppressed the expression of costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80, and CD86) and MHC II, reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12), impaired CD4+ T cell activation, and promoted apoptosis. Mechanistically, SREBF1 activation enhanced lipid biosynthesis in DCs, which triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as evidenced by increased PERK phosphorylation, eIF2α activation, and subsequent ATF4/CHOP induction. SREBF1 silencing attenuated the lipid-induced ER stress and restored DC function, whereas tunicamycin treatment partially reversed these protective effects. Conclusions Our study identifies SREBF1 as a central regulator of sepsis-induced DC immunoparalysis by coupling lipid metabolic reprogramming to ER stress activation. Targeting this SREBF1-lipid-ER stress axis represents a novel strategy to reverse immunosuppression in septic patients.

        <tr id="Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification is critical in various pathological conditions, yet its role in the ARDS microenvironment, particularly at the single-cell level, remains poorly understood. Methods Single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing datasets were sourced from the GEO databases. Bioinformatics and experimental approaches were employed to investigate the associations between m6A regulators and hub genes in ARDS. Results WTAP, HNRNPA2B1, and HNRNPC exhibited extensive expression within the ARDS microenvironment. Consensus clustering analysis segregated patients with sepsis into distinct subgroups, with WTAP showing significant variation across these groups. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified the brown module as most associated with WTAP, revealing five hub genes. Validation experiments confirmed high expression levels of WTAP and MYC in lung tissues. Functional assays further demonstrated that WTAP enhances ARDS progression. Conclusions In conclusion, bioinformatics analysis and preliminary experimental data suggest that WTAP promotes ARDS onset and progression by regulating m6A methylation and facilitating immune cell infiltration.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in the lung and in innate immunity for host defense. To fuel inflammatory responses, AMs do not rely on glycolysis, but require oxidative phosphorylation. However, which nutrients AMs use to fuel their energy demand during inflammatory responses, is still unknown. The present study aimed to determine the contribution of three key metabolic pathways; fatty acid oxidation, glutaminolysis, and glycogenolysis, to the inflammatory response of AMs. Methods Primary AMs were isolated from healthy human volunteers and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After 24 hours, cells were subjected to analyses of metabolic flux, expression of genes involved in these metabolic pathways, and inflammatory cytokine secretion in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. Results The results of our study show that human AMs display expression of genes involved in fatty acid and glutamine metabolism and are capable of metabolizing oleic acid and glutamine during homeostasis, but do not use these metabolites to fuel the production of inflammatory cytokines. We demonstrate that AMs, while residing in a glucose-deprived environment, contain glycogen and use glycogenolysis to fuel inflammatory cytokine secretion, as reflected by reduced TNF, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in supernatant of LPS-stimulated AMs treated with the glycogenolysis inhibitor CP316819. Moreover, AMs display marked expression of genes involved in glycogenesis, including FBP1 and GYS. Conclusions Taken together, these results indicate that primary human AMs are equipped to use different nutrients to fuel their metabolic demands. Moreover, our findings suggest that glycogenolysis is critical for the inflammatory response of AMs.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Traumatic injury triggers the rapid release of damage‐associated patterns (DAMPs). Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play key roles in sensing, processing, and presenting DAMPs to naïve T cells. These heterogeneous immune cells express the adhesion GPCR EMR2/ADGRE2, which is likely regulated by DAMPs. Methods We analysed the various blood DC and monocyte subsets in trauma patients and uninjured volunteers using flow cytometry. EMR2 and its closest relatives, CD97/ADGRE5 and EMR3/ADGRE3, were quantified on these subsets to gain insights into their (patho)physiological regulation. Results Following trauma, conventional and plasmocytoid DCs nearly disappeared from the circulation, which is inversely correlated with injury severity and adverse clinical parameters 120–240 h post injury. Alterations in EMR2 and CD97 on DCs were relatively minor. Classical monocytes increased, while non‐classical monocytes showed a sustained decline in both absolute number and percentage, in a manner dependent on injury severity after trauma. EMR2 expression increased across all monocyte subsets, whereas CD97 showed little change. EMR3 expression decreased and remained low in classical monocytes, while it markedly increased in non‐classical monocytes. These temporal patterns in adhesion GPRC expression were largely independent of injury severity and were observed in all injured patients. Conclusion Circulating DC and monocyte subsets underwent significant compositional changes after trauma, often correlating with injury severity and other clinical parameters. Despite structural similarities, EMR2, CD97, and EMR3 showed distinct regulatory patterns on monocyte subsets, suggesting different functional roles in the immune response to injury.">

        <tr id="Emerging evidence highlights the profound and lasting impact of severe illnesses such as COVID-19, particularly among individuals with underlying comorbidities. Patients with pre-existing conditions like diabetes mellitus (DM) are disproportionately affected, facing heightened risks of both disease exacerbation and the onset of new complications. Notably, the convergence of advanced age and DM has been consistently associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. However, the long-term metabolic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially its role in disrupting glucose homeostasis and potentially triggering or worsening DM, remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes current clinical and experimental findings to clarify the bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes. We critically examine literature reporting deterioration of glycemic control, onset of hyperglycemia in previously non-diabetic individuals, and worsening of metabolic parameters in diabetic patients after infection. Furthermore, we explore proposed mechanistic pathways, including pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and immune-mediated damage, that may underpin the development or progression of DM in the post-COVID setting. Collectively, this work underscores the urgent need for continued research and clinical vigilance in managing metabolic health in COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="The complement (C) pathway, a vital part of innate immunity, defends against pathogens and supports tissue surveillance. While local activation in the periphery enhances immune protection, dysregulation can trigger a self-amplifying cascade that spreads beyond the initial site, resulting in tissue injury. In the brain, complement proteins regulate synaptic plasticity and connectivity, raising the possibility that similar mechanisms of maladaptive propagation may disrupt neural circuits under pathological conditions. Although complement dysregulation is linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, the impact of localized upregulation in a small subset of cells on broader cortical networks remains unclear. To examine this, we overexpressed the schizophrenia (SCZ) risk gene C4 (C4-OE) in approximately 2% of prefrontal cortex neurons in mice using in utero electroporation. Bulk RNA sequencing of microdissected tissue revealed widespread transcriptional changes in a network predominantly comprising untransfected cells. C4-OE induced the upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, cytoprotection, and neurogenesis—suggesting a response consistent with compensatory remodeling or aberrant plasticity. Co-expression analysis identified a C4b-containing module enriched for dendritic development and cell cycle regulation, indicating alterations in circuit maturation. In contrast, immune and inflammatory genes were broadly downregulated, suggesting homeostatic suppression in response to sustained complement activity. Comparisons with human SCZ proteomic datasets revealed conserved gene signatures, highlighting the potential of our model to capture disease-relevant mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that sparse C4 overexpression can trigger widespread transcriptional changes across neural circuits, suggesting that local complement dysregulation may spread through cortical networks and drive broader functional disruption. Graphical Abstract Graphical Abstract: Sparse overexpression of complement C4 in prefrontal cortical neurons triggers widespread transcriptional changes across the network. Upregulated genes were associated with cholesterol biosynthesis, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and cytoprotective pathways, while immune and inflammatory genes were broadly downregulated, suggesting a compensatory response in neighboring, untransfected cells. These results indicate that localized complement dysregulation can alter transcriptional signatures across connected cortical circuits, potentially contributing to circuit-wide dysfunction initiated by focal immune activation.">

        <tr id="Background: Seasonal influenza infection poses substantial risks to pregnant women, yet the immunological mechanisms underlying their heightened disease susceptibility remain incompletely characterized. Methods: This study employed multiparametric immunophenotyping and metabolic profiling to investigate cellular immunity, cytokine dynamics, and serum biomarkers in pregnant women infected with H3N2 across gestational stages. Through integrated flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), multiple cytokine quantification, and LC-MS-based serum metabolomics, we compared immunological parameters, serum cytokines, and metabolites across trimesters in pregnant women infected and not infected with H3N2. Results: The results revealed reduced CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios, a diminished CD27+ memory B cell population in pregnant women infected with H3N2, and elevated NK cells and Th2-skewed cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) in severe influenza cases. Metabolomic profiling identified the dysregulation of the tryptophan–kynurenine (Trp–Kyn) pathway, with a 15-fold increase in the Kyn/Trp ratio in severe influenza compared to a normal pregnancy as a potential biomarker. Conclusions: These results elucidate synergistic pathophysiological axes-immune dysregulation and tryptophan metabolism alteration that potentially drive adverse outcomes. The identified biomarker panel (CD4/CD8 ratio, IL-6, Kyn/Trp ratio) shows potential clinical promise for early risk stratification in high-risk pregnancies with influenza infection.">

        <tr id="The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes serious respiratory illness and related disorders. Vulnerable populations, including those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and the elderly, face an increased risk of severe complications. As the pandemic evolves, various diagnostic techniques are available to detect severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), including clinical presentation, rapid antigen/antibody testing, molecular testing, supplemental laboratory analysis, and imaging. Based on peer-reviewed data, treatment options include convalescent plasma transfusion, corticosteroids, antivirals, and immunomodulatory medications. Convalescent plasma therapy, historically used in outbreaks like Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and SARS, is suggested by the World Health Organization for critically ill COVID-19 patients when vaccines or antiviral drugs are unavailable. Neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma help control viral load and improve patient outcomes, especially when administered early, though effectiveness varies. The United States Food and Drug Administration has authorized its emergency use for severe COVID-19 cases, but potential risks such as transfusion reactions and transfusion-related acute lung injury require further investigation to establish definitive efficacy. Antiviral agents like Remdesivir, an adenosine nucleotide analog, inhibit viral RNA polymerase and have shown efficacy in reducing COVID-19 severity, leading to its emergency use authorization for hospitalized patients. Other antivirals like ritonavir, lopinavir, and umifenovir disrupt viral replication and entry, but their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has been used in critically ill COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation and prevent respiratory failure, as shown in the RECOVERY trial. Other immunosuppressants like ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and colchicine help modulate the immune response, reducing cytokine storms and inflammation-related complications. However, corticosteroids carry risks such as hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, and delayed viral clearance, requiring careful administration. Systematic reviews of clinical studies revealed that hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin did not decrease viral load nor reduce the severity of symptoms, but increased mortality among acutely hospitalized patients. There was no improvement in patients’ clinical conditions after 15 days compared to standard treatment. The United States Food and Drug Administration has revoked the authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients due to the null benefit-risk balance. Monoclonal antibodies like itolizumab, gimsilumab, sarilumab, and tocilizumab are being studied for their ability to reduce the severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, particularly cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These antibodies target specific immune pathways to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, with some showing promising results in clinical trials, though their use remains under investigation. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas13 family of enzymes, sequenced from many COVID-19-positive patients, can potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, cleave the RNA genome, and aid in the amplification of the genome assay. Cas13 can also target emerging pathogens via an adeno-associated virus vector when delivered to the infected lungs. In addition to pharmacological agents, vaccines effectively prevent symptomatic infection, reduce hospitalizations, minimize mortality rates, and ultimately reduce the severity of the disease. This paper aims to explore the management of patients with underlying conditions who present with COVID-19 to lessen the burden on healthcare systems.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease damaging the central nervous system. Diminished inflammatory disease activity (DA) as people with MS (pwMS) age motivated randomized clinical trials assessing disease-modifying therapy (DMT) discontinuation in older pwMS given the concern for risks outweighing benefits. This study aims to examine whether peripheral production of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)-driven cytokine responses mediate the aging-associated decline in MS inflammatory DA. Methods We included the clinical data of 669 adult pwMS between 2017 and 2022 who enrolled in a clinic-based prospective cohort. From a subset of 80 participants, we isolated fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cultured with 50 µg/ml of MBP (or heat-killed Candida) for 24 h. We assayed cell culture supernatants for interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and a subset of the supernatant samples using a commercial human cytokine/chemokine array. We examined the associations between age and annualized relapse rate (ARR) as well as between age and MBP-stimulated cytokine production (by cultured PBMC) using covariate-adjusted linear regressions. We performed mediation analyses to determine the extent to which MBP-driven cytokine response drives the association between age and ARR. Results Among 669 pwMS (mean age 51.7 ± 12.7 years, 80.7% women, 89.4% non-Hispanic White), ARR declined with age (β=-0.003, p < 0.001). Among the subgroup of 80 pwMS whose cultured PBMCs underwent ex vivo MBP stimulation, IL-17 production declined with age in women (β=-0.27, p = 0.04) but not men (β=-0.1, p = 0.73). MBP-driven IL-17 response partially mediated the association between older age and lower ARR (24.6% in women, 15.3% in men). In exploratory analyses, older pwMS (≥ 50 years) had marginally lower (IL-4, MCP-2, MCP-3, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB) and higher (Fractalkine, MDC) concentrations of several cytokines than younger pwMS (< 50 years), while certain cytokines (MCP-2, MDC) mediated whereas others negated the effect of age on ARR. Conclusion Diminished peripheral IL-17 response as a potential biological mechanism underlying the aging-dependent decline in MS inflammatory DA warrants further investigation.

        <tr id="Leigh syndrome (LS) is the most common pediatric presentation of genetic mitochondrial disease and characterized by neurological and metabolic abnormalities. The hallmark of the disease is the presence of progressive, bilateral, symmetric neurodegenerative lesions in the brainstem and/or basal ganglia. Recent studies in the Ndufs4(-/-) mouse model of LS indicate that disease is causally driven by the immune system. Both microglia and peripherally originating macrophages are enriched in the lesions of Ndufs4(-/-) mice and pharmacologic elimination of these cell types prevents disease indicating a crucial role for innate immune cells. Here, we investigated the role of the adaptive immune system in Ndufs4(-/-) disease pathogenesis. We crossed Ndufs4(-/-) mice with mice expressing a null form of interleukin 2 receptor gamma (Il2rg) and monitored disease onset and progression. Il2rg knockout (KO) mice have dramatically depleted numbers of B-, T-, the adaptive immune system’s key cellular actors, and NK-cells. We observed no difference in neurological disease progression or overall survival between Ndufs4(-/-)/Il2rg(WT) and Ndufs4(-/-)/Il2rg(KO) mice, strongly suggesting that T cells, B cells, and NK cells do not play a significant role in CNS disease pathogenesis in Ndufs4(-/-) mice. Combined with previous studies indicating a causal role for macrophages, we conclude that LS CNS pathology is primarily driven by the monocyte/macrophage innate immune system.">

        <tr id="Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), has caused in the last 5 years a global pandemic of unprecedented scale in the modern era. Other than the typical respiratory symptoms, patients suffering from moderate to severe COVID-19 are at risk of developing a peculiar systemic coagulopathy, known as COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. In addition to a predominantly hypercoagulable state, COVID-19 patients may experience hemorrhagic complications triggered by the viral infection. The current knowledge on the underlying molecular mechanisms, the laboratory and clinical characteristics of coagulation abnormalities associated with COVID-19, along with their management, will be summarized in this narrative review.">

        <tr id="Brain atrophy is a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and more recently SARS‐CoV‐2 infection for which the neuroinflammatory mechanism is not fully understood. Nevertheless, neuroinflammation and CD8 T cell accumulation is frequently observed in postmortem brain tissue of patients with neurodegeneration. We therefore developed a murine model of brain atrophy using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection model of multiple sclerosis. We employ single major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule conditional knockout mice generated by our program to analyze the contribution of immune cell infiltration and onset of atrophy. TMEV infected C57BL/6 mice that singularly express H‐2Kb or H‐2Db were evaluated. TMEV infection of these mice resulted in ventricular atrophy at 14 d.p.i. However, H‐2Db expressing mice presented with significantly greater and continuous ventricular atrophy compared to H‐2Kb expressing mice and MHC class I knockout control mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed H‐2Db expressing mice had greater brain infiltrating CD8 T cell responses at 7 and 28 dpi which correlated with the extent of ventricular atrophy. Meanwhile, H‐2Kb and MHC class I knockout mice also had distinct positive correlations with ventricular atrophy and global neuroinflammation in general. These findings support the role of immune cell infiltration into the CNS as a putative mechanism of ventricular atrophy following TMEV infection, with the progressive enlargement of ventricular atrophy observed in H‐2Db mice being associated with the presence of long‐lived memory CD8 T cells residing in the brain.">

        <tr id="The complement system is a highly conserved and essential immune component with pivotal roles in innate and adaptive immunity. It is increasingly recognized that the complement system has a profound impact on disease. Current complement-targeting therapeutics for clinical use almost exclusively target the complement system in circulation. However, recent discoveries have demonstrated that complement is not only liver derived and plasma operative, but also synthesized and activated inside many cells locally within tissues, performing noncanonical, cell-autonomous intracellular functions, collectively referred to as the complosome. These intracellular complement pathways are distinct from the classical plasma-based system and critical for regulating fundamental cellular processes, including metabolism, gene transcription, autophagy, and the activation and resolution of inflammation. This Review explores the emerging roles of the complosome and current knowledge regarding its relation to human diseases, highlighting evidence across organ systems and disease states, including the kidneys, digestive tract, lungs, heart, CNS, musculoskeletal system, skin, and cancer. We also review current scientific approaches for detecting and functionally investigating the complosome, addressing challenges such as technological limitations and the need for advanced experimental models to delineate its tissue-specific roles. Finally, we discuss central unanswered questions critical for developing innovative therapeutic strategies targeting intracellular complement pathways. These strategies hold potential to modulate disease-specific mechanisms while preserving systemic complement activity.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that devastated the world. While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. The present study examined the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using large sample sizes and provides mechanistic information through histological observations. We studied 56 postmortal lung samples from COVID-19 patients. The comparative group consisted of 17 postmortal lung samples from patients who died of influenza A virus subtype H1N1. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before the COVID-19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis, and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of the pulmonary arterial walls. These results demonstrate that COVID-19 significantly affected the pulmonary vasculature in fatal-course patients, also suggesting the need for careful follow-up in non-fatal cases, at risk of pulmonary hypertension.">

        <tr id="Introduction Severe injury, including burn trauma, leads to profound immune dysfunction, yet the mechanisms driving these changes remain incompletely defined. This lack of understanding has hindered efforts to modulate the immune response effectively. Additionally, a clear biomarker profile to guide clinicians in identifying burn patients at high risk for poor clinical outcomes is lacking. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as novel mediators of immune dysfunction in various pathologies. Prior studies in mouse models have demonstrated that plasma EVs increase following burn injury and contribute to immune dysfunction. Furthermore, EVs have potential as biomarkers for predicting extended hospital stays in burn patients. This study hypothesizes that human EVs, purified early and late after burn injury, will exhibit immune reprogramming effects similar to those observed in mice and that specific EV protein cargo may serve as biomarkers of immune and physiological responses to burn injury. Methods EVs were isolated from the plasma of burn-injury patients at early (<72h) and late (≥14 days) time points post-injury. Using unbiased immune transcriptome and bioinformatic causal network analyses, the immunomodulatory effects of these EVs were assessed in human THP-1 macrophages. Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics and pathway analyses were conducted to characterize the protein cargo of EVs from both human and mouse models at different post-burn phases. Results Early post-burn human EVs induced significant immune reprogramming in macrophages, increasing pro-inflammatory signaling while suppressing anti-inflammatory pathways. In contrast, late post-burn EVs exhibited an immunosuppressive profile, with downregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways and upregulation of anti-inflammatory signaling. Proteomic analyses revealed that human and mouse EVs contained unique and overlapping protein cargo across different time points. At day 7 post-burn, mouse EVs were enriched in circulation/complement and neuronal proteins, whereas by day 14, reductions in membrane and metabolism-associated proteins were observed. Similarly, in human EVs at 14 days post-burn, increased levels of circulation/complement, immune, and transport proteins were detected. Conclusions EVs from burn-injury patients at distinct time points differentially modulate immune responses in macrophages, mirroring the temporal immune phenotypes observed in clinical settings. These findings suggest that EV-macrophage interactions play a crucial role in burn-induced immune dysfunction and highlight the potential of EV protein cargo as biomarkers for immune status and patient outcomes following burn injury.">

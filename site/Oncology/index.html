        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Bats can host viruses of pandemic concern without developing disease. The mechanisms underlying their exceptional resilience to viral infections are largely unresolved, necessitating the development of physiologically relevant and genetically tractable research models. Here, we developed respiratory and intestinal organoids that recapitulated the cellular diversity of the in vivo epithelium present in Rousettus aegyptiacus, the natural reservoir for the highly pathogenic Marburg virus (MARV). In contrast to human counterparts, bat organoids and mucosal tissue exhibited elevated constitutive expression of innate immune effectors, including type I interferon-ε (IFNε) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Upon infection with diverse zoonotic viruses, including MARV, bat organoids strongly induced type I and III IFN responses, which conferred robust antiviral protection. Type III IFNλ3 additionally displayed virus-independent self-amplification, acting as an ISG to enhance antiviral immunity. Our organoid platform reveals key features of bat epithelial antiviral immunity that may inform therapeutic strategies for viral disease resilience.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context-dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases. We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT2. Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model, revealing SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells (macrophages and T lymphocytes) and repair Schwann cells, as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve-resident cell types. Notably, endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines (Ccl9, Cxcl5) and complement components (C3, C4b, C6) in response to chronic SARM1 activation, indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non-immune nerve-resident cells. Analysis of CD45+ immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b+ macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation. We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves. Remarkably, T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model. These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1-dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease.

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is a heterogeneous clinical condition of uncertain etiology triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we used ultrasensitive approaches to profile the immune system and the plasma proteome in healthy convalescent individuals and individuals with long COVID, spanning geographically independent cohorts from Sweden and the United Kingdom. Symptomatic disease was not consistently associated with quantitative differences in immune cell lineage composition or antiviral T cell immunity. Healthy convalescent individuals nonetheless exhibited higher titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 than individuals with long COVID, and extensive phenotypic analyses revealed a subtle increase in the expression of some co-inhibitory receptors, most notably PD-1 and TIM-3, among SARS-CoV-2 nonspike-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with long COVID. We further identified a shared plasma biomarker signature of disease linking breathlessness with apoptotic inflammatory networks centered on various proteins, including CCL3, CD40, IKBKG, IL-18 and IRAK1, and dysregulated pathways associated with cell cycle progression, lung injury and platelet activation, which could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of long COVID.">

        <tr id="Background CNS infection by HIV-1 contributes to neuroinflammation, cognitive impairments, and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Although HIV-1 is known to enter the brain early in infection via “Trojan horse” leukocytes, including infected monocytes and CD4+T cells, the specific cellular phenotypes facilitating this process during acute infection remain incompletely characterized. Objective This study aims to characterize the roles of brain lymphocytes during acute infection and primary CD4+ T cell phenotypes seeding the SIV to the CNS. Methods scRNA-seq was performed on brain and blood cells of three acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The transcriptomic data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches and validated through in vitro co-culture assays and re-analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset. Results We found a distinct cell cluster in the brain co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, suggesting brain myeloid cells may engulf CD4+ T cells entering from the blood. This finding was confirmed in by coculture studies of macrophages and T cells, and identified specific chemokines could distinguish such cells. Acute infection induced an increase in proliferating CD4+ cytotoxic-like T cells, which had high expression of viral entry receptors and adhesion molecules, indicating their role in CNS infection. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of cytotoxic genes, MHC class II molecules, ISG15, and USP18 in brain lymphocytes, indicating a robust immune response to acute infection. Conclusion Our findings suggest that CD4+cytotoxic-like T cells represent a key lymphocyte subset responsible for initiating SIV entry into the brain and triggering neuroinflammatory processes. Furthermore, interactions between infiltrating lymphocytes and brain-resident myeloid cells may facilitate viral propagation within the CNS.">

        <tr id="Peripheral surgery evokes neuroimmune activation in the central nervous system and modulates immune cell polarization in the ischemic brain. However, the phenotypic change of microglia and myeloid cells within post-surgical ischemic brain tissue remain poorly defined. Using an integrated approach that combines single-cell RNA sequencing with comprehensive biological analysis in a perioperative ischemic stroke (PIS) model, we identified a distinct Spp1-positive macrophage/microglia (Spp1+ Mac/MG) subgroup that exhibit enriched anti-inflammatory pathways with distinct lipid metabolic reprogrammed profile. Moreover, using immunofluorescence staining, we identified the expression of Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) in Spp1+F4/80+ cells and Spp1+Iba-1+ cells. Intraperitoneal administration of semaglutide, a GLP1R agonist clinically approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulted in a significant reduction of cerebral infarct volume in PIS mice compared to that in ischemic stroke (IS) mice. Meanwhile, semaglutide treatment also increased the proportion of Spp1+Edu+Iba-1+ cells 3 days after PIS. Using high-parameter flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining and RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that semaglutide treatment significantly attenuated the expression of neuroinflammatory markers in mice following PIS. We also found that semaglutide treatment significantly ameliorated sensorimotor dysfunction up to 3 days after PIS in mice. Our current finding reveal a novel protective Spp1+Mac/MG subset after PIS and demonstrated that it can be upregulated by semaglutide. We propose that targeting Spp1+Mac/MG subsets using semaglutide could serve as a promising strategy to attenuate the exacerbated neuroinflammation in PIS.

        <tr id="Abstract Proliferation of microglia represents a physiological process, which is accelerated in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). The effect of such neurodegeneration-associated microglial proliferation on function and disease progression remains unclear. Here, we show that proliferation results in profound alterations of cellular function by providing evidence that newly proliferated microglia show impaired beta-amyloid clearance in vivo. Through sorting of proliferating microglia of APP/PS1 mice and subsequent transcriptome analysis, we define unique proliferation-associated transcriptomic signatures that change with age and beta-amyloid accumulation and are characterized by enrichment of immune system-related pathways. Of note, we identify the DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-Linked (DDX3X) as a key molecule to modulate microglia activation and cytokine secretion and it is expressed in the AD brain. Together, these results argue for a novel concept by which phenotypic and functional microglial changes occur longitudinally as a response to accelerated proliferation in a neurodegenerative environment.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a significant risk to immunocompromised patients, who display weakened immunity and reduced seroconversion following infection and vaccination. In this study, we recruited 19 hospitalized patients with immune disorders (ImCo) and 4 immunocompetent controls (ICC) with COVID-19. We evaluated their serological, humoral, and cellular immune responses at <30 days and >90 days post-symptom onset. ICC patients showed robust B and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, indicated by detectable antibody levels, memory antibody-secreting cells (mASCs) towards the spike protein and spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. ImCo patients showed impaired immune responses, with lower levels of B cell responses. Further subdivision of the ImCo patients demonstrates that solid organ transplant (SOT) patients generated B cell responses similar to ICC patients, whereas the other ImCo patients, including patients with hematological malignancies and anti-CD20 therapy, did not. Absolute T cell numbers and spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were low in the ImCo patients at <30 days but increased at later time points. Our findings suggest that even when B cell responses were reduced, patients could present a T cell response, suggesting a more successful line of passive immunization for immunocompromised individuals focusing on boosting T cell responses.">

        <tr id="Microglia are resident innate immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that provides anti-microbial protection but also promote neuroinflammation. BRD4 is a chromatin reader that binds to acetylated histones and directs transcription of numerous genes. However, it is unknown whether and how BRD4 regulates microglia function. We addressed the role of microglia and BRD4 in a neuroinflammatory disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis. It was reported earlier that in EAE, upon initial T cell activation in the peripheral lymphoid organs, CD4+ T cells migrate to CNS and are reactivated by resident or migratory antigen presenting cells resulting in full manifestation of EAE (Rossi and Constantin, Front Immunol 7:506, 2016), (Plastini et al., Front Cell Neurosci 14:269, 2020). Using conditional deletion of Brd4 in CD4 T cells, we reveal that BRD4 regulates T helper cell differentiation and promotes T cell migration to CNS resulting in EAE. It remained unclear whether resident microglia are capable of reactivating migrating T cells to the CNS and if BRD4 plays a role in the process. To determine the role of microglial BRD4 in EAE, we constructed conditional knockout mice lacking Brd4 (Brd4cKO) in microglia. RNA-seq analysis showed that Brd4 deletion led to the downregulation of many microglia genes in both naive and EAE conditions. Consequently, Brd4cKO mice had markedly reduced EAE pathology, namely reduced paralysis, absence of axonal demyelination and inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines. In vehicle treated mice (vehicle) abundant number of T cells were found to be near microglia that may lead to T cell- microglia interaction and T cell reactivation. In contrast, the number of T cells detected in the CNS of Brd4cKO mice was much fewer. This may lead to reduced T cell- microglia interaction, failure of T cells to get reactivated and hence failed to achieve full manifestation of EAE. These results demonstrate that microglia are critically involved in EAE disease progression for which BRD4 is essential. In summary, BRD4 directs transcription of genes defining microglia function. By so doing BRD4 promotes demyelination and neuroinflammation to exacerbate EAE.

        <tr id="Long COVID is a heterogeneous condition characterized by a wide range of symptoms that persist for 90 days or more following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Now more than five years out from the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the mechanisms driving Long COVID are just beginning to be elucidated. Adipose tissue has been proposed as a potential reservoir for viral persistence and tissue dysfunction contributing to symptomology seen in Long COVID. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from two cohorts: participants with subacute COVID-19 (28–89 days post-infection) compared to pre-pandemic controls, and participants with Long COVID compared to those with those classified as “indeterminate” based on the RECOVER-Adult Long COVID Research Index (12-47 months post-infection). We found no evidence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA in adipose tissue in any participant. SAT from participants with subacute COVID-19 displayed significant transcriptional remodeling, including depleted immune activation pathways and upregulated Hox genes and integrin interactions, suggesting resident immune cell exhaustion and perturbations in tissue function. However, no consistent changes in gene expression were observed between Long COVID samples and samples from indeterminant participants. Thus, SAT may contribute to inflammatory dysregulation following COVID-19, but does not appear to play a clear role in Long COVID pathophysiology. Further research is needed to clarify the role of adipose tissue in COVID-19 recovery.">

        <tr id="There is little understanding of how aging serves as the strongest risk factor for several neurogenerative diseases. Specific neural cell types, such as microglia, undergo age-related maladaptive changes, including increased inflammation, impaired debris clearance, and cellular senescence, yet specific mediators that regulate these processes remain unclear. The aged brain is rejuvenated by youth-associated plasma factors, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), which we have shown acts on the extracellular matrix (ECM) to regulate synaptic plasticity. Given emerging roles for microglia in these processes, we examined the impact of TIMP2 on microglial function. We show that TIMP2 deletion exacerbates microglial phenotypes associated with aging, including transcriptomic changes in cell activation, increased microgliosis, and increased levels of stress and inflammatory proteins measured in the brain extracellular space by in vivo microdialysis. Deleting specific cellular pools of TIMP2 in vivo increased microglial activation and altered myelin phagocytosis. Treating aged mice with TIMP2 reversed several phenotypes observed in our deletion models, resulting in decreased microglial activation, reduced proportions of proinflammatory microglia, and enhanced phagocytosis of physiological substrates. Our results identify TIMP2 as a key modulator of age-associated microglia dysfunction. Harnessing its activity may mitigate detrimental effects of age-associated insults on microglia function.">

        <tr id="Objectives Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a primary contributor to chronic functional impairment in human populations, initiating complex neuroinflammatory cascades and neurodegeneration. Despite extensive research efforts, the precise pathophysiological pathways remain incompletely characterized. This investigation aims to establish a novel therapeutic strategy that targets critical molecular pathways post-injury, potentially addressing the current limitations in the clinical management of TBI patients. Methods The single-cell data of cortical tissue from mice with TBI were obtained from public databases (GSE160763), which was utilized to identify alterations in in the composition of disease-associated cells and related molecules as the disease progresses. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional characteristics of microglia and astrocyte subpopulations. Trajectory analysis was employed to investigate cell differentiation characteristics. Subsequently, we examined the expression and function of microglia-specific molecules, such as IFI204, along with their underlying molecular mechanisms using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), histopathology, behavioral tests, and molecular docking to assess binding status, as well as molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we used molecular docking technology to find small molecule compounds that IFI204 can stably bind to. Results We identified nine major cell populations, most of which undergo dynamic changes following TBI. Astrocytes and microglia were the predominant populations in each group, and further cluster analysis revealed that the proportions of interferon (IFN) and axonogenesis-related microglial subtypes increased after TBI. Trajectory inference analysis indicated that the expression of Ifi204 is upregulated in microglia during disease progression. Conditional microglial knockdown of IFI204 significantly improved neurological deficits in mice, and alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and microglial pyroptosis. Mechanistically, SENP7, identified as a novel molecule, interacts with IFI204 in microglia, catalyzes the deSUMOylation of IFI204, and promotes STING signal activation, ultimately driving microglial pyroptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions The interaction between IFI204 and SENP7 promotes microglial pyroptosis and related mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, in the case of TBI, we hypothesize that targeting IFI204 might yield therapeutic benefits.

Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing (scRNA‐seq) analyzed the activation characteristics of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and the transcriptional heterogeneity of microglia in ECM. In vitro, ECM‐associated microglia were induced by TNFα, IFNγ, and parasite‐infected red blood cells (pRBCs). The interaction between microglia and CD8+ T cells was explored in co‐culture systems through transwell assay, adhesion assay, and cytotoxicity test. Results In vivo, microglia were aggregated in the brainstem and olfactory bulb in the ECM brain, regions that exhibited more severe pathological injury. The transcriptional characteristics of ECM microglia distinguished from physiological microglia and exhibit morphological heterogeneity in the ECM brain. Infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the ECM brainstem exhibit sustained activation characteristics associated with microglia interaction. Based on subcluster analysis, a unique subtype of ECM‐associated microglia was identified, characterized by CXCL10highTNFαhighKi67+. These microglia mediated the recruitment and sustained activation of CD8+ T cells through persistent interactions in co‐culture systems. Conclusions Our study identified an ECM‐associated microglia subtype and explored its interaction with CD8+ T cells, which deepened the understanding of the multifaceted role of microglia in the pathogenesis of CM neuroinflammation.">

        <tr id="Immune responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) following influenza A virus (IAV) infection can influence disease severity, and subsequently inflammation and lung tissue damage in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). This study investigated the role of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a key pattern recognition receptor that senses viral RNA and triggers antiviral and proinflammatory signaling to activate immune responses, in specifically shaping URT and LRT immune responses to IAV infection. Wild type C57Bl/6 and TLR7 knockout (TLR7 KO) mice were infected with the H3N2 IAV strain Hk-X31, and key immune responses in the nasal tissue (URT) and lower airways and lung tissue (LRT) measured after acute infection. We found reduced body weight loss, and increased type II/III interferons and proinflammatory cytokines in the URT of TLR7 KO mice; while LRT inflammation was reduced. TLR7 was essential for activating immune responses in the LRT but played a more selective role in the URT, primarily influencing monocytes, pDCs and B cells. Our data suggest that TLR7 plays a critical role in the transition of inflammation from the URT to the LRT during IAV infection, making it a promising therapeutic target to modulate disease severity.

        <tr id="Given the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the historical emergence of other highly transmissible coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, in vivo coronavirus research remains crucial even when the COVID-19 pandemic is receding. Due to restricted tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses for mouse cells, model systems of infection rely on transgenic expression of the entry receptor human ACE2 (hACE2). Available hACE2 transgenic models using the Krt18 promotor express the receptor across multiple cell types and organ systems, leading to multiple disease features including pneumonia, vascular compromise and neuro-inflammation, that reflect the multi-organ nature of COVID-19. To disentangle the role of cell tropism in driving the clinical manifestations of the disease, we generated two new transgenic mouse models, Sftpa1-hACE2 and Cdh5-hACE2 transgenic mice, with hACE2 restricted to lung epithelium or endothelial cells respectively. In Sftpa1-hACE2 mice, with high expression of the hACE2 receptor in lung alveolar type 2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection led to rapidly progressing disease, characterised by a strong neutrophilic innate immune response in the lung, followed by viral neuro-invasion and early death. Krt18-hACE2 mice additionally recruited various dendritic cell subsets and gradually developed adaptive immunity. In Cdh5-hACE2 Tg mice with exclusive endothelial tropism of the virus, viral inoculation via the lung or systemic circulation did not lead to viral propagation or disease manifestations, despite endothelial expression of hACE2 in the lung. These results suggest that tropism for alveolar epithelial cells increases disease severity, while endothelial cell tropism per se does not drive the vascular consequences often seen in COVID-19 patients. Our new transgenic mouse models will be helpful to dissect how cell tropism contributes to the clinical manifestations of coronavirus infection.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular complications are a hallmark of Post-Acute Sequelae of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC), yet the mechanisms driving persistent cardiac dysfunction remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction in immune cells as a key contributor. This study investigated whether CD14++ monocytes from long COVID patients exhibit bioenergetic impairment, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, and defective oxidative stress adaptation, which may underlie cardiovascular symptoms in PASC. CD14++ monocytes were isolated from 14 long COVID patients with cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, angina) and 10 age-matched controls with similar cardiovascular risk profiles. Mitochondrial function was assessed using a Seahorse Agilent Analyzer under basal conditions and after oxidative stress induction with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured via Tetramethylrhodamine Ethyl Ester (TMRE) assay, mtDNA integrity via qPCR, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dynamics via Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Parallel experiments exposed healthy monocytes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to evaluate direct viral effects. CD14++ monocytes from long COVID patients with cardiovascular symptoms (n = 14) exhibited profound mitochondrial dysfunction compared to age-matched controls (n = 10). Under oxidative stress induced by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), long COVID monocytes failed to upregulate basal respiration (9.5 vs. 30.4 pmol/min in controls, p = 0.0043), showed a 65% reduction in maximal respiration (p = 0.4035, ns) and demonstrated a 70% loss of spare respiratory capacity (p = 0.4143, ns) with significantly impaired adaptation to BSO challenge (long COVID + BSO: 9.9 vs. control + BSO: 54 pmol/min, p = 0.0091). Proton leak, a protective mechanism against ROS overproduction, was blunted in long COVID monocytes (3-fold vs. 13-fold elevation in controls, p = 0.0294). Paradoxically, long COVID monocytes showed reduced ROS accumulation after BSO treatment (6% decrease vs. 1.2-fold increase in controls, p = 0.0015) and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (157 vs. 113.7 TMRE fluorescence, p = 0.0179), which remained stable under oxidative stress. mtDNA analysis revealed severe depletion (80% reduction, p < 0.001) and region-specific damage, with 75% and 70% reductions in amplification efficiency for regions C and D (p < 0.05), respectively. In contrast, exposure of healthy monocytes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein did not recapitulate these defects, with preserved basal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity, though coupling efficiency under oxidative stress was reduced (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID syndrome arises from maladaptive host responses rather than direct viral toxicity, characterized by bioenergetic failure, impaired stress adaptation, and mitochondrial genomic instability. This study identifies persistent mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID monocytes as a critical driver of cardiovascular complications in PASC. Key defects—bioenergetic failure, impaired stress adaptation and mtDNA damage—correlate with clinical symptoms like heart failure and exercise intolerance. The stable elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential and resistance to ROS induction suggest maladaptive remodeling of mitochondrial physiology. These findings position mitochondrial resilience as a therapeutic target, with potential strategies including antioxidants, mtDNA repair agents or metabolic modulators. The dissociation between spike protein exposure and mitochondrial dysfunction highlights the need to explore host-directed mechanisms in PASC pathophysiology. This work advances our understanding of long COVID cardiovascular sequelae and provides a foundation for biomarker development and targeted interventions to mitigate long-term morbidity.">

        <tr id="Interactions between the brain and immune system play a key role in the aetiology of brain disorders, with inflammation emerging as a potential causal factor in subsets of major depressive disorder, particularly those resistant to treatment. The causal mechanisms through which immune activation can drive depressive symptoms remain elusive, limiting the ability to develop new targeted therapies. Using a mouse model of neuroinflammation, involving a TLR7/8 agonist, we found central and systemic inflammation alongside anhedonia-like behaviours, altered thalamostriatal signalling and infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain. Here, we sought to use combined whole-brain transcriptome and spatial transcriptomics approaches to determine whether Aldara-driven neuroinflammation resulted in consistent immune and neurobiological changes throughout the brain. We found evidence of strong immune activation throughout the brain, with astrocytes displaying a strong inflammatory profile that was relatively uniform throughout. However, we found that this global inflammatory signal led to regionally-specific changes in gene expression, particularly reduced expression of genes associated with synaptic function in brain areas underlying mood and anxiety, such as ventral striatum and amygdala. Our data suggest potential mechanisms through which astrocytes regulate neuronal function in response to inflammation.">

        <tr id="ArfGAP with dual PH domain‐containing protein 1 (ADAP1), also known as Centaurin alpha‐1 (CentA1), is an actin‐binding protein highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) that was previously shown to regulate dendritic spine density and plasticity. In the context of disease, ADAP1/CentA1 has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, cancer progression, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reactivation. Here, we document that ADAP1/CentA1 is also mechanistically involved in CNS autoimmunity. We show that ADAP1/CentA1 deficient mice exhibit partial resistance to developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an in vivo disease model recapitulating several features of multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. MS is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the CNS characterized by focal immune cell infiltration, demyelination, and axonal injury. Its etiology is still elusive, but genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease risk. By combining detailed immunophenotyping and single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq), we demonstrate that ADAP1/CentA1 is necessary for mounting a sufficient autoimmune response for EAE initiation and progression. In particular, the current study highlights that ADAP1/CentA1 expression in the immune system mainly targets the functioning of regulatory T cells (Tregs), monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. In summary, our study defines a novel function for ADAP/CentA1 outside of the CNS and helps elucidate the early molecular events taking place in the peripheral immune system in response to encephalitogenic challenges.">

        <tr id="Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by episodic relapses of neurological symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of patients is key to prevent relapses and irreversible damage to the CNS. However, development of therapies targeting early MS is constrained by the lack of knowledge of early MS disease pathogenesis. In RRMS, nervous tissue damage is induced by CNS-infiltrating immune cells, including T cells. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the early events of CNS infiltration by T cells in RRMS, including their interaction with astrocytes and brain endothelial cells. Using a human in vitro model system and tissue samples obtained from newly diagnosed patients and healthy individuals, we found that CD8+CD20+ T cells could cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid-barrier in the absence of inflammation. As CD8+CD20+ T cells are present in the CNS before inflammation and are highly enriched in MS lesions once the disease is initiated, they may be among the first effector cells in RRMS. Our study also showed that CD4+CD20+ T cells can stimulate brain endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules and chemokines needed for peripheral immune cells to adhere and migrate through the BBB, and stimulate astrocytes to produce chemokines directing transmigrating cells to the site of inflammation. This suggests that CD4+CD20+ T cells, once migrated to the CNS, strengthens the infiltration of immune cells to the CNS and hereby amplify CNS inflammation. Altogether, this indicates that CD20+ T cells play a role in the early phases of MS-inflammation and therefore are candidate targets for early treatment.">

Consequently, gnotobiotic mice colonized with OMM12 have more severe LCMV-induced disease pathology but also enhance viral clearance in the intestinal tract. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of adoptively transferred virus-specific T helper cells and endogenous T helper cells in the intestinal tract reveal a stronger pro-inflammatory Th1 profile and a more vigorous expansion in OMM12 than SPF mice. Altogether, our work highlights the causative function of the intestinal microbiome for shaping adaptive anti-viral immunity with implications for vaccination strategies and anti-cancer treatment regimens.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is characterized by persistent symptoms lasting beyond 12 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathomechanims remain poorly understood.


METHODS
We conducted detailed immunological analyses in 47 individuals with PCS, assessed >12 weeks post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and compared them to 25 convalescent controls without symptoms. We performed immune phenotyping of T and B cell subsets, assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific responses using activation-induced marker (AIM) flow cytometry for T cells, and tetramer staining of spike-specific B cells. Cytokine levels in peptide-stimulated cell supernatants and plasma were quantified using a Luminex platform.


RESULTS
PCS individuals exhibited reduced frequencies of AIM+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells (OX40+, PDL1+) and CD8 T cells (CD137+, CD69+) following petide stimulation with S- or N-Antigen, accompanied by diminished IFNγ and IL2 as measured in the cell culture supernatants. In contrast, non-virus specific T cell populations, including their memory differentiation, activation and helper cell differentiation status did not differ between the groups. PCS individuals showed a significant increase in total (CD19+) and activated B cells (CD86+, HLA-DR+), but not in SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific B cells (∼0.2% of total B cells). Plasma cytokine analysis revealed elevated markers associated with vascular damage and inflammation in PCS individuals.


CONCLUSION
Persistent immune disturbances in individuals with PCS are characterized by reduced SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, increased B cell activation, and altered inflammatory and vascular biomarkers. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of PCS and may contribute to biomarker discovery and therapeutic development.Trialnumber: DRKS00030974registry's URL: https://www.bfarm.de/EN/BfArM/Tasks/German-Clinical-Trials-Register/_node.html.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astroviruses are a common cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans and have been linked to fatal cases of encephalitis. A major barrier to the study of human-infecting astroviruses is the lack of an in vivo model as previous attempts failed to identify a host that supports viral replication. We describe a novel murine model of infection using astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1), an astrovirus with high seroprevalence in humans. VA1 is cardiotropic, and viral RNA levels peak in the heart tissue 7 days post-inoculation in multiple different murine genetic backgrounds. Infectious VA1 particles could be recovered from heart tissue 3 and 5 days post-inoculation. Viral capsid was detected intracellularly in the heart tissue by immunostaining, and viral RNA was detected in cardiac myocytes, endocardium, and endothelial cells based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. Histologically, we identified inflammatory infiltrates consistent with myocarditis in some mice, with viral RNA colocalizing with the infiltrates. These foci contained CD3 +T cells and CD68 +macrophages. Viral RNA levels increased by >10 fold in the heart tissue or serum samples from Rag1 or Stat1 knockout mice, demonstrating the role of both adaptive and innate immunity in the response to VA1 infection. Based on the in vivo tropisms, we tested cardiac-derived primary cells and determined that VA1 can replicate in primary human cardiac endothelial cells, suggesting a novel cardiovascular tropism in human cells. This novel in vivo model of a human-infecting astrovirus enables further characterization of the host immune response and reveals a new cardiovascular tropism of astroviruses. IMPORTANCE Astroviruses routinely cause infections in humans; however, few methods were available to study these viruses. Here, we describe the first animal system to study human-infecting astroviruses by using mice. We demonstrate that mice are susceptible to astrovirus VA1, a strain that commonly infects humans and has been linked to fatal brain infections. The virus infects the heart tissue and is associated with inflammation. When mice with impaired immune systems were infected with VA1, they were found to have higher amounts of the virus in their hearts and blood. We found that VA1 can infect cells from human blood vessels of the heart, which is associated with human health. This model will enable us to better understand how astroviruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection. Our findings also suggest that astroviruses could be linked to cardiovascular diseases, including in humans.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is characterized by CNS infiltration of auto-reactive immune cells that drive both acute inflammatory demyelination and chronic progressive axonal and neuronal injury. Expanding evidence implicates CD8+ anti-neural T cells in the irreversible neurodegeneration that underlies progression in multiple sclerosis, yet therapies specifically targeting this cell population are limited. CD8+ T cells from patients with MS exhibit increased engagement of the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway reduced glycolysis, glucose uptake, NADPH production, ATP production, proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in CD8+ T cells activated by ligation of CD3 and CD28. Pentose phosphate pathway inhibition also prevented CD8+ T cell-mediated antigen-specific neuronal injury in vitro and in both an adoptive transfer-based cuprizone model of demyelination and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Notably, transcriptional profiling of CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients with MS indicated increased pentose phosphate pathway engagement, suggesting that this pathway is involved in CD8+ T cell-mediated injury of axons and neurons in the demyelinated CNS. Inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway disrupts CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming and effector functions, suggesting that such inhibition may serve as a therapeutic strategy to prevent neurodegeneration in patients with progressive MS.">

        <tr id="In this comprehensive review, we delve into the significant body of research on single-cell transcriptomics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to understand neurological diseases with autoimmune, neurodegenerative, infectious, or oncogenic origins. We thoroughly examine all published studies in these areas, with a particular focus on multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. For these diseases, we review findings related to immune cells that infiltrate the brain, based on postmortem brain tissue analyses and include CSF cytometry findings. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), and single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) are increasingly vital tools for studying CSF to understand various aspects of neurological diseases. These advanced techniques allow researchers to explore the etiopathogenesis of these conditions by identifying the roles and interactions of different immune cells. scRNA-seq provides detailed insights into the gene expression profiles of individual cells, revealing how specific cell types contribute to disease progression. scTCR-seq and scBCR-seq enable the study of clonal expansion in T and B cells, respectively, and facilitate antigen prediction, helping to uncover the nature of antigens that trigger adaptive immune responses. By integrating these technologies, scientists can define new therapeutic targets and categorize patients, leading to more personalized and effective treatments. This review highlights the promising advancements and addresses the current limitations of single-cell transcriptomics in the context of CSF and neurological diseases, setting the stage for future breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Differences in immune profiles of children and adults with COVID-19 have been previously described. However, no systematic studies have been reported from infants hospitalized with severe disease. We applied a multidimensional approach to decipher the immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infected infants (n = 26; 10 subacute, 11 moderate and 5 severe disease; median age = 1.6 months) and matched controls (n = 14; median age = 2 months). Single cell (scRNA-seq) profiling of PBMCs revealed substantial alterations in cell composition in SARS-CoV-2 infected infants; with most cell-types switching to an interferon-stimulated gene (ISGhi) state including: (i) CD14+ monocytes co-expressing ISGs and inflammasome-related molecules, (ii) ISGhi naive CD4+ T cells, (iii) ISGhi proliferating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and (iv) ISGhi naive and transitional B cells. We observe increased serum concentrations of both interferons and inflammatory cytokines in infected infants. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are also consistently detected in the absence of anti-IFN autoantibodies. Compared with infected adults, infants display a similar ISG signature in monocytes but a markedly enhanced ISG signature in T and B cells. These findings provide insights into the distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of life and underscore the importance of further defining the unique features of early life immunity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), continues to circulate globally despite the widespread vaccination and therapeutics like Paxlovid, remdesivir, and molnupiravir. COVID-19 is associated with both respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations, with persistent intestinal pathology contributing to the post-COVID-19 condition. We have previously demonstrated the antiviral activity of autophagy-blocking drugs, such as Berbamine dihydrochloride, against intestinal SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. In addition, the autophagy blockers restored the barrier function of infected intestinal epithelium. In this addendum, using human intestinal organoids, we present evidence for a protective role of intrinsic higher levels of autophagy flux in limiting intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological treatment with Akt inhibitor MK-2206 hydrochloride suppressed viral entry into the intestinal epithelium. This antiviral effect of MK-2206 was shown to be dependent on Synaptosomal-associated protein 29-dependent (SNAP-29)-mediated autophagy flux. Furthermore, extrinsically enhanced autophagy with MK-2206 also prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced intestinal barrier damage. Our findings thus underscore the intricate role of autophagy pathways in the dissemination and pathogenesis of intestinal SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the therapeutic potential of host-directed therapies targeting autophagy to intervene in COVID-19-associated sequelae and improve intestinal health.">

        <tr id="The Coronaviridae family has again demonstrated the potential for significant neurological complications in humans during the recent pandemic. In patients, these symptoms persist throughout the infection, often lasting for months. The consequences of most of these post-infection symptoms might be linked with abnormal cytokine production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression, resulting in neuron damage. We investigated the effect of infection with the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) JHM strain and Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) on a primary microglia and astrocyte culture by analysing ROS production, cytokine and chemokine expression, and cell death during one month post infection. For this purpose, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and a high-throughput Luminex ProcartaPlex immunopanel for 48 cytokines and chemokines were utilised. The replication of MHV-JHM and SDAV in microglia and astrocytes has increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The cytokine expression induced by the two viruses differed, as did their detection after infection. SDAV infection resulted in a much broader cytokine response compared to that of MHV-JHM. Both viruses significantly increased ROS levels and induced apoptosis in a small percentage of the cells, but without necrosis.">

        <tr id="Introduction The chronic nature of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) allows it to coexist with diverse pathologies. However, it remains unclear whether immune alterations associated with LTBI influence COVID-19 coinfection and patient outcomes. This study aims to compare the immune phenotype of patients with LTBI/COVID-19 to those with COVID-19 alone, in order to assess whether latent tuberculosis infection induces significant immune cell alterations. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured and stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (M. bovis BCG) to evaluate cellular distribution and function. Results the LTBI/COVID-19 group exhibited a narrower range of symptoms and required less complex treatment regimens than the COVID-19 group. The cellular evaluation revealed that individuals with COVID-19 displayed a distinct immune profile, characterized by a predominance of monocytes expressing pro-inflammatory and regulatory markers, including TNFR2, HLA-DR+TNFR2, and CD71. While CD4+ T cell subpopulation distribution and function were similar across groups, LTBI/COVID-19 and COVID-19 exhibited similar frequencies of CD8+perforin+ and CD8+Granzime B+ T cells. However, LTBI/COVID-19 displays lower soluble levels of granzyme B and perforin in culture supernatants and perforin, granulysin, and sFas in plasma compared to COVID-19. Notably, CD8+ T cells from LTBI/COVID-19 showed higher antigen-specific degranulation than COVID-19. Moreover, LTBI/COVID-19 individuals predominantly displayed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with highly polarized, compact mitochondria at baseline, which remained unchanged under stimulation. In contrast, COVID-19 had T cells with highly polarized, fragmented mitochondria at baseline, a profile that persisted under stimulation. Conclusion The findings reveal significant alterations in monocytes and T cells of individuals with LTBI/COVID-19, suggesting that co-infection may induce changes in the cellular phenotype and cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a neurological disease that primarily affects premature infants and involves infiltration of blood into the brain’s ventricles followed by excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to ventricular enlargement and increased intracranial pressure. The precise mechanisms driving PHH development and persistence are incompletely understood and lack disease-modifying treatments. Using a mouse model of PHH, we have identified transcriptomic, proteomic, and cellular features of PHH involving neuroimmune and neurovascular alterations recapitulating those reported in human disease. Improvement upon a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced PHH mouse model was combined with unbiased proteomic and single-nucleus transcriptomics that identified microglial molecular pathways propagating PHH. Pharmacological depletion of microglia in vivo significantly reduced PHH-associated ventriculomegaly. These data identify microglial and neurovascular elements in the development of PHH, implicating them as other potentially tractable therapeutic targets beyond LPA receptors, towards developing medical treatments for PHH.">

        <tr id="Introduction The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (XBB.1.5) variants, has substantially influenced the clinical and immunological landscape of COVID-19. This study investigates the differential pathogenicity and immune responses in a feline model infected with these variants, focusing on neutrophil activation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and cytokine profiles. Methods Eight pathogen-free cats were inoculated with B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2 (n=3), XBB.1.5 (Omicron) SARS-CoV-2 (n=3), or vehicle (n=2), and clinical assessments, histopathological examinations, and cytokine analyses were performed post-infection. Results Results demonstrate that Delta-infected cats exhibit more severe clinical manifestations characterized by significant elevation in respiratory effort, wheezing, and systemic inflammation compared to Omicron-infected cats, which show milder symptoms, primarily confined to the upper respiratory tract. Histopathological findings suggest pronounced lung damage in Delta-infected cats, whereas Omicron infection resulted in localized pathology. Cytokine profiling demonstrates heightened proinflammatory responses, particularly in Delta-infected cats, characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α while Omicron infection results in less pronounced inflammatory responses. Moreover, neutrophil-related parameters, including total neutrophil counts and banded neutrophils, were significantly elevated in Delta-infected cats, correlating with enhanced NET formation as evidenced by increased NETs-related markers MPO, NE, and citrullinated H3, and NET-specific markers MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free DNA. Discussion This study underscores the importance of variant-specific immune responses and highlights the need for targeted therapeutic strategies that mitigate severe lung injury associated with Delta infection, while also considering the distinct immune dynamics observed with the Omicron variant. Furthermore, results support the importance of delineating immune responses concerning future variants. These findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in companion animals and inform public health strategies as new variants continue to emerge.">

        <tr id="Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is associated with milder COVID-19 symptoms than previous strains. This study analyzed alterations in natural killer (NK) cell-associated immunity dynamics in mild and moderate COVID-19 cases during the Omicron phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients aged ≥16 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalized at Tottori University Hospital between January 2022 and May 2022. A total of 27 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 11 and 16 were diagnosed with mild and moderate COVID-19, respectively, based on the Japanese COVID-19 clinical practice guideline. Peripheral blood NK cell subsets and surface markers, including the activating receptor NKG2D and the inhibitory receptor TIGIT, as well as serum levels of 24 immunoregulatory markers, such as cytokines and cytotoxic mediators, were measured at admission and recovery. In addition, to explore immune patterns associated with disease severity, differences in 24 serum markers and soluble UL16-binding protein 2 (sULBP2) at the clinically most symptomatic time point during hospitalization were visualized using a volcano plot and analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Results Patients with mild COVID-19 exhibited expanded subsets of unconventional CD56dimCD16- NK cells with elevated NKG2D expression and lower levels of cytotoxic mediators (granzyme A, granzyme B, and granulysin). In contrast, patients with moderate disease exhibited NK cell exhaustion, characterized by upregulation of TIGIT, along with increased levels of NK cell-associated cytokines and cytotoxic mediators. The volcano plot identified that the patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited significantly elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed that IL-6, IFN-γ, soluble Fas, and CXCL8 were correlated with increased sULBP2. The PCA identified distinct clusters based on disease severity. Conclusions The results of study highlight the differences in NK cell-associated immune alterations between mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. Elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels, along with their correlations with inflammatory mediators, reflects differences in immune response based on disease severity. These findings provide insight into the immune response to infection caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and improve our understanding of its immunological features.">

        <tr id="The Global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 was initiated by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In addition to conventional pulmonary lesions, a range of neurological injury symptoms have been identified in clinical practice, but the aetiology of neurological disorders linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains poorly understood. Syrian hamsters, which are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, exhibit a disease phenotype similar to that observed in human COVID-19 patients. In this study, a hamster model of COVID-19 infection was used to analyze molecular changes in different tissues at various time points post infection with distinct strains using proteomic and phosphoproteomic approaches. Multi-omics analysis showed that SARS-COV-2 infection triggers sustained downregulation of the abundance and phosphorylation levels of neuronal and synapse-associated proteins in the brain, suggesting that neuronal damage persists even during the recovery period. Additionally, infections with SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the onset of long-term symptoms of COVID-19 by impacting energy metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic transmission pathways. This study provides a comprehensive molecular profile of hamsters infected with different SARS-CoV-2 strains in different tissues, offering foundational insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound impact on global health, with nearly 800 million cases reported in the Americas alone. The clinical presentation of the disease is highly variable, with approximately half of all patients experiencing severe symptoms. This variability confounds the complex interplay between immune responses and disease severity. Severe cases are often characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. Over 88% of COVID-19 patients have multiple comorbidities; factors such as age and pre-existing conditions further modulate immune responses and contribute to the severity of the disease. While some studies have reported differences in cytokine profiles between severity groups, larger, well-designed cohorts are needed to clarify these relationships. Natural Killer cells, which are critical for the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2, are often impaired and contribute to immune exhaustion. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 evades innate immune defenses through accessory proteins that inhibit interferon signaling and exacerbate cytokine storms and inflammation. This integrative review aims to synthesize findings from 2020 onward and provide insights into the innate immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and their contributions to disease pathogenesis. Understanding cytokine dynamics, NK cell behaviors, and viral immune evasion strategies is critical for advancing therapeutic approaches.">

Surprisingly, we identified a pleocytosis in the CSF, most pronounced in patients with early PD. Single-cell RNAseq revealed increases in CSF-specific microglia-like macrophages expressing JAK-STAT and TNFα signaling signatures in prodromal PD, with a lack of T cell activation in the CSF. The CSF macrophages exhibited similar transcriptional profiles to dural macrophages from human α-synuclein-expressing PD model mice. These findings uncover a myeloid-mediated TNFα inflammatory process in the CNS of patients with prodromal PD, suggesting a novel pathological mechanism in disease etiology.">

        <tr id="Monkeypox is a viral zoonosis caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). Although the virus was identified decades ago, human immunity to MPXV infection has not been widely characterized. During MPXV infection, macrophages are recruited at the site of infection and are thought to contribute to the spread of the virus. Cases of MPXV vertical transmission were reported in infected pregnant women to the developing fetuses in utero resulting to high viral burden in placenta tissue and abortion. We aim to understand the impact of MPXV infection at the foeto‐maternal interface by focusing on macrophages functions. Using full‐term placental explant model, macrophages were recruited at site of infection. Isolated naive macrophages are permissive to MPXV infection and secrete high levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines associated with a strong M1 polarization profile. Analysis of antiviral gene expression reveals upregulation of IFNA and IFN‐associated genes suggesting that MPXV induces the expression of some component of antiviral response from macrophages that are unable to clear the virus. Our study shows that macrophages are permissive to MPXV that subverts inflammatory and antiviral machinery without virus clearance. Such findings contribute to better knowledge of MPXV vertical transmission pathogenesis.">

It is well established that the pivotal molecular event is a hyperinflammatory response also referred to as a cytokine storm. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine miRNAs which might be predictive for the admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). We analyzed blood samples from 210 COVID-19 patients and the control group consisted of 80 healthy individuals. Results revealed the miRNA expression pattern has the potential to predict the severity of COVID-19, reflecting the clinical symptoms of the infection, such as the need for oxygen therapy and concomitant pneumonia. In particular, low expression of miRNAs miR106a-5p, miR17-5p, miR181a-5p, miR191-5p, miR20a-5p and miR451a, especially in the initial phase of the disease, is associated with an unfavorable clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection (admission to the ICU).">

        <tr id="Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may present with a wide clinical spectrum, including extrapulmonary involvement, such as neurological damage. Although the pathogenesis of neurological COVID-19 still remains unclear, some studies have discussed the potential association between tissue injury and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and/or immune imbalance. These two mechanisms are non-mutually exclusive; however, exacerbated inflammatory-response-induced neurological damage appears to be more aligned with COVID-19 pathogenesis, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication in the CNS remains widely discussed. Herein, we dissect this last issue, highlighting some evidence on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, as well as discussing gaps that should be addressed for a better understanding of its potential neurotropism, specifically in the CNS. Finally, we propose some deeper reflections on the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic potential.">

        <tr id="Background Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a significant threat to human health. The virus causes potentially fatal disease of the central nervous system (CNS), for which no treatments are available. TBEV infected individuals display a wide spectrum of neuronal disease, the determinants of which are undefined. Changes to host metabolism and virus-induced immunity have been postulated to contribute to the neuronal damage observed in infected individuals. In this study, we evaluated the cytokine, chemokine, and metabolic alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of symptomatic patients infected with TBEV presenting with meningitis or encephalitis. Our aim was to investigate the host immune and metabolic responses associated with specific TBEV infectious outcomes. Methods CSF samples of patients with meningitis (n = 27) or encephalitis (n = 25) were obtained upon consent from individuals hospitalised with confirmed TBEV infection in Brno. CSF from uninfected control patients was also collected for comparison (n = 12). A multiplex bead-based system was used to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Untargeted metabolomics followed by bioinformatics and integrative omics were used to profile the levels of metabolites in the CSF. Human motor neurons (hMNs) were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and infected with the highly pathogenic TBEV-Hypr strain to profile the role(s) of identified metabolites during the virus lifecycle. Virus infection was quantified via plaque assay. Results Significant differences in proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-α2, TSLP, IL-1α, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-12p40, IL-15, and IL-18) and chemokines (IL-8, CCL20, and CXCL11) were detected between neurological-TBEV and control patients. A total of 32 CSF metabolites differed in TBE patients with meningitis and encephalitis. CSF S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP1) and Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) levels were 2.4-fold (range ≥ 2.3-≥3.2) higher in encephalitis patients compared to the meningitis group. CSF urocanic acid levels were significantly lower in patients with encephalitis compared to those with meningitis (p = 0.012209). Follow-up analyses showed fluctuations in the levels of O-phosphoethanolamine, succinic acid, and L-proline in the encephalitis group, and pyruvic acid in the meningitis group. TBEV-infection of hMNs increased the production of SAM, FBP1 and PEP in a time-dependent manner. Depletion of the metabolites with characterised pharmacological inhibitors led to a concentration-dependent attenuation of virus growth, validating the identified changes as key mediators of TBEV infection. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the neurological disease outcome of TBEV infection is associated with specific and dynamic metabolic signatures in the cerebrospinal fluid. We describe a new in vitro model for in-depth studies of TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis, in which the depletion of identified metabolites limits virus infection. Collectively, this reveals new biomarkers that can differentiate and predict TBEV-associated neurological disease. Additionally, we have identified novel therapeutic targets with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and deepen our understanding of TBEV pathogenesis.

        <tr id="The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of numerous variants with enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. Despite widespread vaccination, infections persist, and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 reprograms host metabolism remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether virus-induced lipid remodeling is conserved across variants and whether changes in lipid abundance correlate with alterations in lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Using global untargeted lipidomics and quantitative proteomics, we analyzed A549-ACE2 cells infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants and compared them to cells infected with the ancestral WA1 strain. In parallel, we conducted quantitative proteomics to assess virus-induced changes in the host proteome. Our results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 drives a remarkably consistent pattern of metabolic rewiring at both the lipidomic and proteomic levels across all three variants. We mapped changes in the expression of host metabolic enzymes and compared these to corresponding shifts in lipid abundance. This integrative analysis identified key host proteins involved in virus-mediated lipid remodeling, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), and ORM1-like protein 2 (ORMDL2). Together, these findings highlight conserved metabolic dependencies of SARS-CoV-2 variants and underscore host lipid metabolism as a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.">

        <tr id="With the concurrent circulations of SARS-CoV-2 omicron and influenza A viruses in the community, there is evidence showing co-infection with both viruses. However, disease severity may vary due to the complex immunity landscape of the patients and the neutralizing antibody waning status. The intrinsic dynamic relationship and pathological significance for such co-infections remain largely unknown. The replication kinetics and innate immune responses from the co-infections of SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron BA.1 and D614G variant) and influenza A viruses (pandemic H1N1, seasonal H3N2 and highly pathogenic avian H5N1) were characterized in human respiratory tissue explants, human airway, and alveolar epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 reduced the replication of influenza A viruses, but not vice versa, during co-infections in human bronchial tissues and airway epithelial cells. In lung tissues, the co-infections showed minimal effects on each other, but the viral replications of the two viruses were mutually reduced except for H1N1pdm in the alveolar epithelial cells irrespective of the enhancement of the ACE2 receptor. Notably, the co-infections showed a significant upregulation of the innate immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to single infections in both respiratory epithelial cells, suggesting that co-infections of influenza A viruses potentially lead to more severe damage to the host than SARS-CoV-2 single infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite over 13 billion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses administered globally, persistent post-vaccination symptoms, termed post-COVID-19 vaccine syndrome (PCVS), resemble post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Symptoms like cardiac, vascular, and neurological issues often emerge shortly after vaccination and persist for months to years, mirroring PASC. We previously showed the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein persists in CD16+ monocytes after infection, potentially driving PASC. Approved vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, AstraZeneca) deliver synthetic S1 to elicit immunity, suggesting a shared mechanism. We hypothesized that vaccine-derived S1 persistence in CD16+ monocytes sustains inflammation akin to PASC, contributing to PCVS. We studied 50 individuals with PCVS symptoms lasting over 30 days post-vaccination and 26 asymptomatic controls, using (1) machine learning-based immune profiling to compare cytokine signatures with PASC, (2) flow cytometry to detect S1 in CD16+ monocytes, and (3) LC-MS to confirm S1 across vaccine types. We correlated S1 persistence with symptom duration and inflammation. Prior infection was excluded via clinical history, anti-nucleocapsid antibody tests, and T-detect assays, though definitive tests are lacking. Preliminary findings suggest S1 persistence in CD16+ monocytes and an associated inflammatory profile may contribute to PCVS. Further studies are needed to confirm causality and prevalence.">

        <tr id="Objectives To evaluate the immune persistence and cross-immune response of elderly individuals after Omicron BA.5 infections. Method The neutralizing antibodies against WT, BA.5, XBB.1 and EG.5 strains were analyzed. The T/B-cell subsets’ responses were tested through intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Results The neutralizing antibodies titers against WT and BA.5 strain, remaining high level for at least 6 months, were higher than that of both XBB.1 and EG.5 variants. The neutralizing antibodies of WT, BA.5, XBB.1, and EG.5 strains in the elderly were slightly lower than those in middle-age. The memory B cells decreased rapidly in the elderly, and Tfh, Th17 cells of the elderly continued to increase for only 3 months, while Tfh and Th17 cells increased in the middle-aged for over 6 months. For the elderly, after peptide stimulation, unswitched/switched memory B cells decreased, while double negative B cells displayed higher proliferation. The proportions of both naïve and Temra cells in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells declined, whereas those of Tcm and Tem cells elevated. In the meantime, both CD69+ and CD38+ T cells decreased, but the frequencies of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed an increasing trend. The proportions of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ cells also increased in older people with long COVID symptoms at 3m post-infection. Conclusions Omicron BA.5 infection induced lower neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1 and EG.5 variant.

        <tr id="Changes in brain iron levels are a consistent feature of multiple sclerosis (MS) over its disease course. They encompass iron loss in oligodendrocytes in myelinated brain regions and iron accumulation in myeloid cells at so-called paramagnetic rims of chronic active lesions. Here, we explore the mechanisms behind this overall shift of iron from oligodendrocytes (OLs) to myeloid cells (MCs) and the loss of total brain-iron in MS. We investigated the expression of various iron importers and exporters, applying immunohistochemistry to a sample of control and MS autopsy cases. Additionally, we studied the transcriptional response of iron-related genes in primary rodent OL progenitor cells (OPCs) and microglia (MG) to various combinations of known MS-relevant pro-inflammatory stimuli together with iron loading. Histologically, we identified a correlation of OL-iron accumulation and the expression of the ferritin receptor TIM1 in myelinated white matter and observed an increase in the expression of iron-related proteins in myeloid cells at the lesion rims of MS plaques. qPCR revealed a marked increase of the heme scavenging and degradation machinery of MG under IFN-γ exposure, while OPCs changed to a more iron-inert phenotype with apparent decreased iron handling capabilities under MS-like inflammatory stimulation. Collectively, our data suggest that OL iron loss in MS is mainly due to a decrease in ferritin iron import. Iron accumulation in MCs at rims of chronic active lesions is in part driven by up-regulation of heme import and metabolism, while these cells also actively export ferritin.

        <tr id="Background Tuberculous meningitis is the most severe form of tuberculosis and HIV-1 co-infection worsens the already poor prognosis. However, how Mycobacterium tuberculosis crosses the blood-brain barrier and how HIV-1 influences tuberculous meningitis pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Using human pericytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia alone and combined in an in vitro blood-brain barrier model, we investigated the effect of Mycobacterium tuberculosis +/- HIV-1 co-infection on central nervous system cell entry and function. Cells and the blood-brain barrier model were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and/or HIV-1 and we evaluated the effects of both infection on (i) cells susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its growth in cells by flow cytometry; (ii) modulation of blood-brain barrier permeability and Mycobacterium tuberculosis passage through it; (iii) viral and bacterial cytopathogenicity using the xCELLigence system; (iv) cell metabolic activity and ROS release using colorimetric assays; (v) extracellular glutamate concentration by fluorometric assay; (vi) the inflammatory response by Luminex; and (vii) endoplasmic reticulum stress by quantitative PCR. Results We demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects and multiplies in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. Mycobacterium tuberculosis also induces an increase of the blood-brain barrier permeability resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects include (i) increased markers of cellular stress (mitochondrial metabolic activity, unfolded protein response); (ii) ROS release; (iii) the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes; (iv) and the secretion of the excitotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate. Lastly, we observed distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators. Conclusion These results indicate that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can translocate the blood-brain barrier directly to initiate meningitis.

        <tr id="The autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc) presents with multiple organ manifestations that often complicate management strategies. To explore variations in immune cell subsets and their link to clinical heterogeneity, here we perform single-cell profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 21 SSc patients who never received immunosuppressive therapy. We identify a subset of EGR1+ CD14+ monocytes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This subset activates NF-kB signaling and differentiates into tissue-damaging macrophages, which accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, we identify a CD8+ T cell subset with type II interferon signature in the peripheral blood and the lung tissue of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD), suggesting that chemokine-driven migration of these cells contributes to ILD progression. Thus, our single-cell analysis reveals distinct immune cell abnormalities associated with clinical organ manifestations, providing insights into tailored treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) includes a uniquely regulated immune response that supports homeostasis, response to injury, and response to pathogens. Recent work has shown that virus-associated immune responses in the CNS may contribute to neuronal injury and long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive decline. However, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate acute infiltration of immune cells from vascular compartments into the CNS are not well defined. Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection. CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells exhibit a bystander, memory phenotype (CD49d+, Tbet+, NKG2D+, Eomes+), are cytotoxic, and are recruited independent of antigen specific responses. We show that infiltration of CD8+ bystander T-cells is supported by microglia and infiltrating macrophage expression of IL-15 and interferon expression in the CNS. These innate antiviral immune signals support activation of bystander CD8+ T-cells in the CNS that contribute to tissue injury independent of virus replication at early time points post-infection. These data support a mechanism by IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T-cells to enter the CNS and contribute to injury independent of antigen-specific stimulation. Importance Prior studies have shown that virus infections in the respiratory and olfactory nerve pathways can result in long term injury in the brain. However, the mechanisms that link virus infection in the olfactory neurons and brain injury are not understood. We show that virus infection of olfactory neurons results in immune stimulation in the brain of resident immune cells to release a cytokine called IL-15 and interferon. This results in infiltration and activation of non-specific T-cells that cause injury of neurons in the brain. This may be an important mechanism by which respiratory viruses and other viruses cause inflammation and injury in the brain.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite the diminishing global impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus continues to circulate and undergo mutations, posing ongoing challenges for public health. A comprehensive understanding of virus entry mechanisms is crucial for managing new epidemic strains. However, the cellular processes post-endocytosis remain largely unexplored. This study employs proximity labeling to examine proteins near ACE2 post-viral infection and identified syntaxin-6 (STX6) as a factor that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by impeding the endocytic release of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances early endosome recruitment of STX6. STX6 appears to hinder the maturation of viral particles-laden early endosomes into late endosomes, from which the virus could escape. Instead, it promotes the trafficking of the virus toward the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. STX6 exhibits a broad-spectrum effect against various SARS-CoV-2 variants and several other viruses that enter via endocytosis. We report for the first time the function of STX6 as a restrictive factor in viral infection. IMPORTANCE Virus entry is the first step of the virus life cycle, and the exploitation of the endo-lysosome pathway for cellular entry by viruses has been well documented. Meanwhile, the intrinsic defense present within cells interferes with virus entry. We identified STX6 as a host restriction factor for viral entry by facilitating the virus trafficking to the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. Notably, STX6 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants and other viruses employing endocytosis for entry.

        <tr id="Pathogen-induced septic death presents a substantial public health challenge, with its neuroimmune mechanisms largely unexplored. Our study investigates neurotransmitter modulation of ACOD1 expression, a regulator of immunometabolism activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Screening neurotransmitters identifies dopamine as a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced ACOD1 expression in innate immune cells. Mechanistically, DRD2 forms a complex with TLR4, initiating MAPK3-dependent CREB1 phosphorylation and subsequent ACOD1 transcription. Conversely, dopamine disrupts TLR4-MYD88 interaction via DRD2 without affecting the formation of the LPS-induced TLR4-MD2-CD14 complex. Enhanced ACOD1 expression induces CD274/PD-L1 production independently of itaconate, precipitating inflammation-associated immunosuppression in sepsis. Delayed administration of pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, mitigates lethality in bacterial sepsis mouse models. Conversely, the dopamine antagonist aripiprazole exacerbates sepsis mortality. Dysregulation of the dopamine-ACOD1 axis correlates with sepsis severity in patients, indicating a potential therapeutic target for modulating this neuroimmune pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toxoplasma gondii is a foodborne intracellular parasite that chronically infects the brain. Although T. gondii infection elicits a protective immune response, the nature of the monocyte response in the immediate vicinity of parasites during initial brain infection is not well understood. By infecting mice with T. gondii and comparing areas of the brain containing or not containing parasites, we found an increase in CCR2+ monocytes, IBA1+ myeloid cells, GFAP+ astrocytes, and CD68+ signal near parasites in the brain, indicating immune cell infiltration and phagolysosomal activation in response to the infection. CCR2+CD68+ monocytes were specifically increased near tachyzoites with minimal localization of these cells near cysts in the brain. This monocyte response was also detected near parasite-interacted cells, identified using T. gondii parasites that inject Cre recombinase into “interacted” cells of Ai6 CCR2RFP/+ mice, enabling us to track these events in vivo. The chemokine CCL2 and its transcription factor NF-κB were also upregulated surrounding parasites in the brain; however, the T. gondii effector protein GRA15, which sustains NF-κB activation in infected cells, was not required for CCL2 production, NF-κB activation, or myeloid cell recruitment to parasites in the brain. In contrast, active T. gondii replication played a more significant role, as CCR2+ monocytes were recruited to replication-competent but not replication-deficient T. gondii delivered via intracranial injection into mice. These findings provide novel insights into the drivers of immune cell mobilization and activation in the brain during initial T. gondii central nervous system infection and highlight the importance of parasite replication in this process. IMPORTANCE Toxoplasma gondii is a brain-infecting parasite, and the mobilization of peripheral immune cells to the brain is critical for controlling T. gondii infection. However, the initial events driving these cells to sites of T. gondii infection in the brain are poorly understood. We show that peripheral myeloid immune cell recruitment and activation are specific to areas of the brain containing actively replicating parasites, which are capable of lysing host cells. This local immune response is characterized by focal chemokine production, myeloid cell recruitment, and the activation of phagolysosomal pathways. These highly localized host responses were independent of the parasite effector protein that induces NF-κB activation within infected cells, GRA15. However, the localized monocyte recruitment was dependent on live parasites and active parasite replication. This research highlights the importance of host cell sensing of parasite replication in the brain for immune control of T. gondii infection.

        <tr id="Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating symptom in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Fresh insights indicate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may undergo neuron-like differentiation, potentially contributing to pain mechanisms. By examining the apolipoprotein E (APOE) together with the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), this study aims to clarify their joint function in modulating differentiation and how this interplay might be implicated in chronic pain associated with NPC. Through comprehensive analysis using TCGA-NPC transcriptomic datasets and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we assessed the molecular landscapes of both NPC-affected and healthy nasopharyngeal tissues. Differential gene expression and immune cell profiling identified macrophages as key players in the inflammatory response. Single-cell sequencing revealed a distinct subpopulation of neuron-like macrophages expressing neurogenesis-related genes. Macrophage-to-neuron-like cell transformation in response to NPC cells was examined through in vitro co-culture systems, highlighting the involvement of the APOE-TREM2 regulatory pathway. In vivo studies involved macrophage depletion and TREM2 knockdown in mouse models to evaluate the impact on chronic pain development. Infiltrating macrophages were significantly more abundant in NPC samples, with many exhibiting neuron-like features that were positively linked to high levels of WNT5 A expression. In vitro, NPC cells induced macrophage differentiation into neuron-like cells, a process regulated by TREM2 and APOE. TREM2 knockdown in macrophages resulted in a reduction of chronic pain behaviors in mouse models, highlighting the contribution of the APOE-TREM2 Axis to NPC-associated chronic pain. Our findings demonstrate that NPC cells promote macrophage reprogramming through the APOE-TREM2 Axis, leading to neuron-like differentiation and contributing to chronic pain in NPC patients. Targeting this pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies for managing chronic pain in NPC. Graphical Abstract 1. Neuron-like macrophages contribute to chronic pain in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through the APOE-TREM2 axis. 2. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a unique subset of macrophages expressing neurogenesis-related genes in NPC tissues. 3. APOE-TREM2 signaling regulates the neuronal-like differentiation of macrophages, promoting pain-related pathways in NPC. 4. Targeting the APOE-TREM2 axis may offer novel therapeutic strategies for alleviating chronic pain in NPC patients.

        <tr id="For a more precise understanding of the course of the pathological process in patients with severe COVID-19, it is necessary to continue the search for factors that affect the course of the pathological process and the possibility of a favorable outcome in critically ill patients. Comparative RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) in patients with a severe clinical course of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta strain revealed a number of differentially expressed genes that distinguish patients with different clinical outcomes (survivors vs. nonsurvivors) in the period of 30 days after admission to the hospital. Most of them are associated with the “negative regulation of viral process” and “negative regulation of immune response” clusters. Moreover, in surviving patients, there is increased expression of the key genes C1QB, C1QA, ISG15, SERPING1, VSIG4, KLRD1, TRPM4, and HFE incorporated in these clusters. Among these key genes, the ISG15 gene, which links several clusters of gene ontology enrichments and encodes an interferon-induced ubiquitin-like protein, deserves special attention. Its product, ISG15, is known to be a primary substrate for SARS-CoV-2 protease PLpro, which plays a role in counteracting hosts’ antiviral mechanisms.

        <tr id="The CSF1R inhibitor Plx3397, an FDA-approved treatment for a rare cancer, has been shown to reduce microglia, lower inflammation, and improve synaptic integrity in several mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the effects of Plx3397 on synaptic and neural function in AD remain largely unknown. Here, we used the 5xFAD mouse model to characterize the effect of Plx3397 treatment. While Plx3397 administration increased synaptic density in 5xFAD mice, it also reduced the percentage of neurons phase-locked to gamma oscillations. This neural decoupling was closely associated with gene expression changes related to synapse organization. These observations prompted us to investigate whether gamma-frequency entrainment could counteract the neural circuit alterations induced by Plx3397 administration. We thus enhanced gamma phase-locking in neurons using non-invasive patterned sensory light stimulation. Remarkably, restoring gamma oscillations improved neural function, reshaped gene expression signatures, and improved learning and memory in Plx3397-treated 5xFAD mice. These findings suggest that CSF1R inhibitors like Plx3397 may benefit from a multimodal approach combining microglial targeting with non-invasive sensory stimulation to support neural physiology and improve cognitive function in AD.">

 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe postinfectious complication associated with SARS-CoV-2. Although the crucial pathogenic role of the monocyte compartment is known, information regarding the mechanisms and maintenance of the inflammatory trigger is lacking. Genetic variants in the OAS/RNase L pathway, involved in viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing and the modulation of inflammatory responses, have been identified in patients with MIS-C. We conducted a comprehensive analysis, including the study of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, blood biomarkers, and autoantibodies, as well as transcriptomic and proteomic profiling.



 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, and RNA samples from MIS-C patients were analyzed. PBMCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and inflammatory responses were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC). Apoptosis was assessed via annexin V staining. Type I interferon (IFN) signatures were measured using qPCR. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated using an automated ELISA system (ELLA). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed through bioinformatics pipelines, including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), while proteomics data were processed using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA).



 We found a monocyte exhaustion phenotype, demonstrated by reduced inflammasome activation in response to stimuli and an associated lack of IL-1β secretion (Figure 1A-B). Intriguingly, dsRNA was detected in monocytes from MIS-C patients even during follow-up, suggesting a long-lasting viral presence that could drive sustained immune activation (Figure 1C-D). Blood biomarker profiling, bulk RNA-seq, and proteomic analyses revealed a signature characterized by the activation of genes involved in antiviral response, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and coagulation pathways. Additionally, we observed anti-IL1RA autoantibodies in 40-50% of patients, consistent with previous reports.

(A) In vitro inflammatory cytokine secretion by MIS-C patients’ PBMCs (T1: 0 to 10 days from onset, T2: 10 to 30 days from onset, and T3: over 30 days from onset) of as measured in culture supernatant after 18 hours with or without stimulation with the indicated stimuli. The NLRP3 blocker MCC950 inhibited secretion, indicating that secretion of IL-1β is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome. (B) Percentages of spontaneous and after ASC specks detection in monocytes (left) and after stimulation (LPS+ATP, right) from controls (HD), MIS-C patients in acute stage (T1), and during follow-up (T2-3) by flow cytometry.

Data are expressed as median ± IQR. *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .005, ****P < .001 as assessed by Mann–Whitney t test.



 Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, encompassing monocyte exhaustion, persistence of intramonocytic dsRNA, autoantibody formation, and a distinct transcriptomic and proteomic signature. This study provides insights into the underlying mechanisms driving sustained inflammation in post-COVID syndromes.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease linked with deregulated immune responses, leading to hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis, often with fatal outcomes. Neutrophils play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, with elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts correlating with disease severity. Despite extensive research, the molecular processes associated with neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 remain elusive. Methods To investigate the molecular signatures underlying neutrophil-driven pathology, we conducted transcriptome analysis in neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients versus healthy individuals. To evaluate the specificity of identified neutrophil signatures in COVID-19, we extended our transcriptomic analysis to neutrophils from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a non-infectious fibrotic lung disease. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining was performed on lung biopsy specimens from IPF patients to validate transcriptomic findings at the tissue level. Results Our analysis revealed significant transcriptional changes in COVID-19 neutrophils, particularly in pathways involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and antiviral responses. Additionally, pathways associated with autophagy and chromatin remodeling were upregulated, while translation-related processes were suppressed, indicating an increased predisposition for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release. This neutrophil transcriptional signature in COVID-19 appears to be associated with the previously reported deregulation of the Activin/Follistatin system in the periphery. Notably, a comparative transcriptomic analysis with neutrophils isolated from IPF patients revealed the induction of substantially overlapping inflammatory processes, suggesting common deregulated responses in COVID-19 and IPF. Consistently, significant NET formation, a hallmark of COVID-19-related inflammation, was observed within lung biopsies from IPF patients. Conclusion By delineating both shared and disease-specific molecular pathways, our findings validate the critical role of neutrophils in COVID-19 and IPF pathophysiology, highlighting their involvement in balancing the inflammatory response across diverse lung diseases.

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability, with reperfusion injury contributing significantly to poor clinical outcomes. Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, play a dual role in ischemic stroke by both exacerbating injury through neuroinflammation and supporting recovery through neuroprotection. This study aimed to explore the role of CD74, a gene upregulated in microglia following ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing, we identified CD74 as a potential target involved in microglial-mediated neuroinflammation. We observed a significant increase in CD74 expression in microglia following middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R), which correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine production and neuroinflammation. Targeted knockdown of CD74 in microglia using CX3CR1Cre/ERT2 mice led to a reduction in infarct volume, inflammatory cytokine levels, and long-term neurological deficits. Behavioral tests showed improved motor coordination, sensory function, and exploratory behavior in CD74 knockdown mice. These results suggest that CD74 is a critical mediator of microglia-driven neuroinflammation, and targeting CD74 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing ischemic brain injury and promoting recovery after stroke.

This connection arises from the molecular and immunological interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host. Autoimmunity can be triggered by various factors that create an overly stimulated immune system. The virus activates both innate and adaptive immunity, which can result in disease progression. COVID-19 disrupts normal antiviral immunity and plays a role in the onset of autoimmune diseases. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, including molecular mimicry, bystander activation of T-cells, transient immunosuppression, and inflammation. Additionally, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may also provoke autoimmunity. In this review, we explore the various factors through which SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to autoimmune diseases, aiming to minimize the risk of developing such conditions following COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.">

        <tr id="The virus known to cause COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, exhibits severe and complex neurological symptoms. These effects may be attributed to a virus-induced neuroinflammatory environment, warranting exploration of the respiratory centers of the brain, namely the pons and medulla, specifically in relation to neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neuronal death in response to COVID-19. Interestingly, older adults with neurological dysfunction maintained on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, such as memantine, had reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate (1) the neuroinflammatory response to COVID-19 in the respiratory centers of the brain, and (2) to assess the extent to which NMDAR antagonists offer neuroprotective measures in the context of COVID-19. In a susceptible mouse model, animals inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 were pre-treated with either memantine or an alternative NMDAR antagonist, ifenprodil. Inoculated animals had poor survival and showed signs of neuroinflammation, evidenced by a reduction in morphological structure, demyelination, and changes in astrocyte and microglial expression in the pons and medulla. Mice pre-treated with memantine showed improved survival when challenged with COVID-19 and a reduction in virus-induced neuroinflammatory impairments. Our findings support the further investigation of memantine for the prevention of COVID-19 induced neuroinflammation and resultant neurological symptoms and shed light on the possible protective mechanism of memantine in the elderly maintained on NMDAR antagonists.">

        <tr id="Background Long-COVID immunopathogenesis involves diverse factors. We longitudinally characterize hospitalized COVID-19 patients, examining the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and inflammation in immune dysregulation. Methods Hospitalized patients are evaluated during acute infection (T0), 3 months post-symptom onset (T1), and 3 years if symptoms persisted (T2). Immune profile includes characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-specific T/B cells (flow cytometry) and antibodies (ELISA, neutralization, ADCC). RNAemia and cytokines are quantified (RT-PCR, cytometric beads array) and correlated. Statistics: non-parametric cross-sectional, longitudinal and correlation analyses. Results Here we show 48 hospitalized individuals during acute COVID-19, 38 exhibit early persistent symptoms (EPS+) 3 months post-symptoms onset, 10 do not (EPS−). Groups are comparable for age, sex, co-morbidities. The EPS+ shows fatigue, dyspnoea, anosmia/dysgeusia, diarrhea, chronic pain, mnestic disorders. Over time, they show a reduction of neutralization ability and total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, with increased total CD4 TEMRA, and failure to increase RBD-specific B cells and IgA+ MBCs. EPS+ patients show higher levels of T0-IFN-γ + CD4 TEMRA, T1-IL-2 + CD4 TEM and T1-TNF-α + CD4 cTfh. In EPS+, baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia positively correlates with CD4 TEMRA, follow-up SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with ADCC. Among 38 EPS+ individuals at T1, 33 are evaluated 3 years after infection, 5 are lost at follow-up. 10/33 EPS+ show long-term symptoms (late persistent symptoms, EPS + LPS+), whereas 23/33 fully recover (EPS + LPS−). Antibodies, RNAemia, and cytokines show no differences between/within groups at any time point. Conclusions Early persistent symptoms are associated with multi-layered SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune dysregulation. The shift towards non-Ag-specific TEMRA and ADCC trigger in EPS+ may relate to SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Early immune dysregulation does not associate with long-term persistent symptoms. Further research on SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and early immune dysregulation is needed.">

Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol. Results We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent. Conclusions Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.">

        <tr id="Background Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with neuroinflammation playing a critical role in the secondary cell death that exacerbates the initial injury. While targeting neuroinflammation holds significant therapeutic promise, clinical trials of available anti-inflammatory agents have fallen short. 3-Mono-thiopomalidomide (3-MP), a novel immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD), was designed to curb inflammation without the adverse effects of traditional IMiDs and was evaluated across models involving neuroinflammation. Methods 3-MP anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated across cellular (RAW 264.7, IMG cells) and mouse studies following lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenge (for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines), and mice subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). 3-MP human cereblon binding, including neosubstrate and molecular modeling evaluation, as well as chicken teratogenicity, ex vivo mouse and human stability studies, and mouse pharmacokinetics were appraised. Results 3-MP binds human cereblon, a key protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, without triggering downstream cascades leading to thalidomide-like teratogenicity in chicken embryos. 3-MP reduces pro-inflammatory markers in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage and microglial cell cultures, and lowers pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels in plasma and brain of mice challenged with systemic LPS without lowering anti-inflammatory IL-10. 3-MP readily enters brain following systemic administration, and achieves a brain/plasma concentration ratio of 0.44–0.47. 3-MP mitigates behavioral impairments and reduces activation of astrocytes and microglia in mice challenged with CCI TBI. Conclusion 3-MP represents a promising new class of thalidomide-like IMiDs with potent anti-inflammatory effects that offers potential for treating TBI and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases possessing a prominent neuroinflammatory component.

        <tr id="Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by a drastic loss of dopaminergic neurons already at diagnosis. As this loss of neurons starts decades before diagnosis, understanding the prodromal stages of the disease might offer novel strategies to curb its progression. While the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying PD remain incompletely understood, growing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation play a central role in the development and progression of the disease. Here, we delve into the emerging roles of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, in the pathogenesis of prodromal and early-stage PD. We emphasize that microglia contribute to neuroinflammation, protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet known. Neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the patterns of microglial activation detected in individuals with prodromal PD and at the time of clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, we highlight the complex interplay between immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration along PD development, including alterations in the peripheral immune system, brain-gut interactions and brain-immune interfaces. Lastly, we outline existing models for investigating microglial involvement in prodromal PD, along with the impact of anti-inflammatory therapies and strategies to modify risk factors. In conclusion, targeting microglial activation and immune dysfunctions in individuals at risk of PD could represent a promising preventive measure and may offer novel therapeutic strategies for early intervention and disease modification.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected hundreds of millions of people globally, resulting in millions of deaths. During this pandemic, children have demonstrated greater resistance than adults, exhibiting lower infection rates, reduced mortality, and milder symptoms. Summarizing the differences in resistance between children and adults during COVID-19 can provide insights into protective mechanisms and potential implications for future treatments. In this review, we focused on summarizing and discussing the mechanisms for better protection of children in COVID-19. These protective mechanisms encompass several factors: the baseline expression of cell surface receptor ACE2 and hydrolase TMPRSS2, the impact of complications on COVID-19, and age-related cytokine profiles. Additionally, differences in local and systemic immune responses between children and adults also contribute significantly, particularly interferon responses, heterologous protection from non-COVID-19 vaccinations, and immune status variations influenced by micronutrient levels. The advantageous protection mechanisms of these children may provide insights into the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Importantly, while age-related metabolic profiles and differential COVID-19 vaccine responses may contribute to protection in children, current comparative research remains limited and requires further investigation.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a key contributor to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, driven by factors such as viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and peripheral inflammation. However, the mechanisms linking peripheral inflammation or viral infections to neuroinflammation remain poorly understood, limiting the development of effective therapies. Proinflammatory cytokines are implicated in these processes but their effects on brain cells, including microglia, remain insufficiently characterized. Here, we demonstrate that IL-21, a proinflammatory cytokine elevated in autoimmune disorders, chronic viral infections, and Alzheimer’s disease, activates microglia and promotes lipid accumulation within these cells. Young, healthy mice injected with IL-21 to mimic chronic exposure exhibited increased proinflammatory cytokine levels and microglial activation in the brain. Notably, microglia in these mice displayed enhanced lipid accumulation, accompanied by upregulation of lipid uptake receptors such as CD36 and TREM-2. These findings were corroborated using the human microglial cell line HMC-3, where IL-21 exposure similarly induced lipid accumulation and increased expression of CD36 and ApoE. Mechanistic investigations revealed that IL-21 upregulates HIF-1α, a transcription factor critical for lipid metabolism and lipid droplet formation. Additionally, we observed elevated IL-21 levels in the circulation of elderly individuals compared to younger counterparts, with IL-21 increases associated with CMV seropositivity. Aged mouse brains mirrored the microglial lipid accumulation and activation patterns seen in IL-21-injected mice. In summary, we identify a novel IL-21-driven mechanism involving lipid accumulation in microglia that contributes to neuroinflammation.

        <tr id="Long Covid is a post-viral syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms targeting multiple organ systems after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current literature suggests that the mechanisms causing Long Covid involve viral persistence, immune dysregulation, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. By forming reservoirs in the tissues of various organs, SARS-CoV-2 may evade immunological clearances while triggering immune responses and contributing to chronic symptoms through cytokine imbalances, T-cell exhaustion, and systemic inflammation. These symptoms parallel other post-viral syndromes such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting similar mechanisms of pathology. The coronavirus has also been linked to neuroinflammation and endothelial dysfunction causing cognitive symptoms and cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, its ability to lower energy production links it to post-exertion malaise (PEM) and muscle pain. These symptoms may result from iron dysregulation and persistent oxidative stress due to Covid-impaired mitochondrial function. This review synthesizes current data on the mechanisms that drive Long Covid pathogenesis and explores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate viral persistence, immune dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. It is critical to understand these interactions to develop targeted interventions that address the long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection and improve patient outcomes.">

Methods In this study, we examined immune responses throughout the progression in murine DED model. Using cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we observed dynamic alterations in the proportions of immune cell landscape. Pseudotime trajectory and cell–cell communication analyses further illustrated T-cell differentiation and interaction networks. Results CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exhibited an initial decline on Day 3 (D3) and followed by a recovery on Day 7 (D7). Single-cell transcriptomics provided insights into 15 distinct subsets of T cells with heterogeneous functional states. Pseudotime trajectory analysis demonstrated coordinated differentiation patterns of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, indicating their collaborative involvement in the inflammatory process. Conclusions Our results clarify the dynamics of the adaptive immune response in DED and indicate that targeting T cells may serve as a promising immune-modulatory approach in the treatment of DED model.

        <tr id="Purpose The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 and RA through immune inflammation. Methods First, we conducted a meta-analysis on the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization rate, and mortality rate for patients with RA. Then, Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate the causal relationship between COVID-19 and RA, and further analyzed the cytokines and immune cells in COVID-19 and RA. Finally, we obtained microarray datasets of COVID-19, RA patients, and normal controls from the GEO database. And performed functional, pathway enrichment, and immune cell infiltration analysis on differentially expressed genes between each group. Results The meta-analysis results suggested that the hospitalization rate and mortality rate of RA patients infected with COVID-19 were higher than those of the control population. MR analysis showed a positive correlation between COVID-19 infection and RA. We also found that interleukin 13 was associated with RA and COVID-19 infection. CD27 on IgD + CD24 + B cells and CD3 on CD39 + CD8 + T cells are common immune cell phenotypes in two diseases. In addition, COVID-19 function is enriched in immune responses mediated by leukocytes and neutrophils, while RA is significantly enriched in the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. The results of immune cell infiltration showed that both diseases had more neutrophils and fewer CD8 T cells. Conclusion There are many similarities between COVID-19 and RA in immune inflammatory responses such as cytokines and immune cells. COVID-19 may lead to the development of RA through immune inflammation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40659-025-00620-7.">

        <tr id="Background Infection with enteric bacterial pathogens continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. These pathogens include enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, which transit the intestinal tract, efface microvilli, and attach firmly to intestinal epithelial cells predominantly in the colon. Investigation of these human-adapted pathogens has been greatly aided by mouse models of infection. The mouse-adapted attaching and effacing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium utilizes many similar mechanisms of pathogenesis, including the use of a type III secretion system, and virulence factors encoded in a locus of enterocyte effacement. Although this model has allowed for assessing the complexity of the host response, the complex interplay between the nervous and immune systems in response to infection remains incomplete. Methods We assessed the role of sensory neurotransmitters encoded by the Tac1 gene in the host response to C. rodentium. Results Tac1-deficient mice had significantly reduced pathogen shedding and colonic bacterial burden, accompanied by decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In accordance with reduced chemokine production, we observed reduced colonic recruitment of specific immune cell populations in Tac1-/- compared to WT mice. Conclusions Sensory neuropeptides regulate key aspects of enteric bacterial infection and may serve as unique targets in the treatment of enteric disease.">

With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in milder forms despite anti-retroviral therapy, leading to premature and exacerbated aging-related cognitive disorders. We investigated the interplay between HAND and aging in microglia, which constitute the main brain HIV reservoir. We compared the transcriptomic patterns associated with normal aging in healthy humans to those observed following HIV infection in both ex vivo and in vivo models. Single cell and bulk transcriptomic patterns revealed that HIV infection induces a pattern of cellular senescence, with strong parallels to the transcriptomic signature of normal aging. Both processes were characterized by p53 pathway activation, upregulation of inflammatory genes and downregulation of proliferative genes while maintaining mTOR signaling, a pattern characteristic of cellular senescence. Importantly, both actively HIV infected and bystander microglia showed the cellular senescence patterns. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for the observed premature brain aging in HAND, and identify senescence-associated pathways as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused a global public health crisis, with a significant impact on multiple body systems. This virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, shows ~80% genomic similarity to SARS-CoV and ~50% genomic similarity to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The spike (S) protein plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the virus, as it facilitates its entry into host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In addition to the respiratory system damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a variety of gastrointestinal (GI), neurological, cardiovascular (CV), ocular, renal, etc. clinical manifestations. Neurological complications, such as anosmia, ague, headache, encephalitis and cerebrovascular events, were frequently observed, being attributed to both direct viral invasion and a very strong systemic inflammatory response. GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common and may occur independently of respiratory symptoms, and the presence of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) detected in fecal samples suggests possible fecal-oral transmission. The CV system is affected by myocardial damage, inflammation and coagulation disorders, with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. At the ocular level, the virus was identified in ocular secretions, and conjunctivitis, uveitis and episcleritis were observed in about 11% of patients. Renal involvement, manifested by acute kidney injury, was detected in 0.5-7% of cases. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to respiratory tract involvement but also has significant systemic implications.">

        <tr id="The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury are highly complex. Previous studies have indicated phenotypic changes in various cell types following stroke but have failed to identify the key regulatory genes and cell subtypes associated with the disease. The study utilized five datasets: GSE227651, GSE104036, GSE116878, GSE249957, and GSE22255. The Seurat pipeline was employed for standard quality control and single-cell data analysis. Monocle2 and CytoTRACE were used for trajectory analysis, while Mfuzz was applied to identify time-series gene expression patterns. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice served as the animal model for cerebral I/R injury, and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated BV2 cells were used to simulate microglial phenotypic changes following ischemia-reperfusion. qPCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect key gene and protein alterations. P65 was identified as a key transcription factor driving inflammatory responses and transcriptional changes following ischemic stroke. Two microglial subtypes, Cx3cr1 + and Cdk1+, were identified, with their proportions significantly increasing on days 1 and 3 after MCAO. Increased levels of inflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and P65 phosphorylation in microglia were observed in both the MCAO animal model and OGD/R cell model. Notably, inhibition of P65 phosphorylation effectively suppressed the progression of inflammation during cerebral I/R injury. We identified microglial subtypes associated with inflammatory responses following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, with their proportions increasing post-injury. P65 was confirmed as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response, contributing to neuronal protection and the restoration of neurological function.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tamdy virus (TAMV) is one of the zoonotic tick-borne bunyaviruses that have emerged as global public health threats in recent decades. To date, however, TAMV pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have established different mouse infection models to enable investigation of TAMV pathogenesis. Adult BALB/c mice did not exhibit obvious clinical symptoms or signs post-TAMV infection. In contrast, adult type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR−/−) A129 mice were found to be susceptible to high-doses of TAMV (6 × 102 and 6 × 104 FFU) and all developed severe clinical symptoms and signs, including weight loss and immobility, and reached the euthanasia criteria at 4/5-day post-infection (dpi). Viral RNA was detected in peripheral blood and different tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, and brain) of the high-dose infected adult A129 mice, with the highest viral loads in the liver (approximately 108.3 copies/μL). Pathological examination also revealed severe liver damage in the high-dose infected A129 mice. In addition, the titres of TAMV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies increased rapidly 4–5 dpi. Analysis of cytokine and chemokine expression changes demonstrated that type I IFN may play an important role in the host defence against viral infection by enhancing IL-10 production. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses showed that liver injury may be associated with virus-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Together, we have investigated TAMV pathogenesis using immunocompetent and immunocompromised mouse models, which will facilitate the development of TAMV-specific antivirals and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Introduction Understanding the intricacies of the host inflammatory response to coronaviruses is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to mitigate the severe consequences of these infections. Various coronaviruses can trigger the host immune response, leading to highly similar inflammatory reactions. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which belongs to the same group of beta-coronaviruses as SARS-CoV-2 and induces high pathogenicity in mice, typically serves as a safety model for investigating highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, replication, and virus-host interactions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) infected with MHV. Results We characterized the global gene changes at both the mRNA and protein levels following viral infection, identifying ten genes involved in various anti-MHV biological processes. Furthermore, by integrating our findings with relevant published data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells, we observed significant similarities in the responses to MHV and SARS-CoV-2, particularly regarding immune and inflammatory responses. Discussion These findings underscore how our research enhances the understanding of global gene expression alterations during coronavirus infection and facilitates the identification of novel antiviral targets.">

 Respiratory viruses lead to severe mortality and morbidity worldwide. There is a continuous eruption of new and already existing viruses throughout the year. To understand the occurrence of co-infection of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to severity in patients. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was conducted on nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients infected with respiratory-like illness. The primers for two respiratory viruses, HMPV and SARS-CoV-2, were used for amplification. 9.9% of the samples were found to be infected with HMPV, and of these, 88.8% were also infected with SARS-CoV-2. The fluctuations in cytokine levels were also correlated, and it was found that interferon levels were low during mixed infection. We also report that while HMPV infection does not induce a hyperinflammatory effect, as a mixed infection with SARS-CoV-2, it could inhibit the adaptive immune responses due to reduced secretion of interferon-gamma, leading to insufficient sensitisation for B cells to produce antigen-specific response antibodies.">

        <tr id="Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) represent one of the most susceptible populations for developing severe COVID-19, and a unique human genetic condition for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility of neurologically vulnerable individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human Chromosome-21 (HSA21) triplication in DS causes global transcriptional deregulation, affecting multiple genes that may directly (e.g., TMPRSS2) or indirectly influence the SARS-CoV-2 entry into central nervous system (CNS) cells. The anti-viral immune response may also be altered in cells with trisomy-21 (T21) due to triplication of genes encoding for several interferon receptor subunits and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we demonstrate that human cells derived from fetal cortical specimens and maintained in primary cultures are susceptible to infection with a molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to express the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and to authentic SARS-CoV-2. The level of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cultures originated from different cortical specimens varied, seemingly depending on ploidy and chromosomal sex of the cells. We confirmed the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cultures and found that XY T21 group had the highest TMPRSS2 mRNA levels, which was associated with increased infectivity in XY—compared to XX T21 cultures. The XX T21 cultures exhibited elevated expression of several ISGs (MX1, STAT1, and STAT2) which was associated with lower infectivity. The comparisons of postmortem aged brain specimens revealed reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2, but elevated STAT2 protein levels in individuals with DS and Alzheimer’s disease (DS-AD) compared to control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) group. Collectively, these results suggest multifactorial regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cortical cells that involves ploidy, chromosomal sex, and the expression of genes implicated in regulation of virus entry and anti-viral response as contributing factors.

        <tr id="Respiratory viruses, including the influenza virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pose significant health threats. As tissue-resident macrophages, alveolar macrophages (AM) are crucial for defending against respiratory viral infection by producing cytokines, engulfing virus-infected cells, and promoting wound healing. However, excessive inflammatory responses can lead to tissue injury. Growing evidence indicates that astragaloside IV (AST IV) regulates innate immune responses. Specifically, AST IV balances the inflammatory response to mitigate tissue damage and promote tissue repair. However, whether AST IV directly targets AM to alleviate lung damage induced by respiratory viral infection remains unclear. Our results demonstrate that AST IV treatment significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in mice during IAV infection. AST IV markedly decreases proinflammatory cytokine levels, mitigates lung injury and promotes lung recovery through enhancing the repair capacity mediated by alveolar type II cells. Mechanistically, AST IV suppresses the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, which is critical for driving inflammatory responses in AM while maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Thus, our findings suggest that AST IV effectively targets AM to alleviate inflammation and lung damage caused by respiratory viral infections, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for managing viral pneumonia.

        <tr id="Background Vitiligo is an acquired skin depigmentation disorder often accompanied by leukoderma and leukotrichia. Half of vitiligo patients experience episodes of stress. Methods We established a chronic unpredictable mild stimulation (CUMS) model in C57BL/6 J mice to simulate chronic mental stress-induced leukoderma and leukotrichia. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to determine the immune landscape and to characterize the relationship between immune-stromal cells. Immunohistochemistry was employed for validation. Results We discovered a similar pro-inflammatory micro-environment composed of keratinocytes and fibroblasts similar to that in human vitiligo. Macrophages in CUMS mice expressed high levels of inflammatory factors and were inclined to an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. Two distinct clusters of melanocytes were also identified: Mel2, defined as melanocyte stem cells, and Mel3, defined as mature melanocytes. Mel2 cells were prone to pyroptosis and necroptosis, while Mel3 cells were susceptible to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. Compared with control mice, higher expression of CXCL16 on dendritic cells and of the CXCL16 ligand, CXCR6, on γδT cells were observed in leukoderma. Dendritic cells and natural killer T cells in the CUMS mouse spleen exhibited elevated levels of CXCL16 and CXCR6, respectively. Activation of the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis and a non-specific immune response in our CUMS model might imitate chronic mental stress-induced vitiligo in humans better than CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated models. Conclusions We discovered two melanocyte clusters with distinct fates and a pro-inflammatory micro-environment with CXCL16–CXCR6 axis activation of antigen-presenting cells and other innate immunocytes that might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of stress-induced vitiligo.

        <tr id="COVID-19 is associated with increased risks of neurological and psychiatric sequelae. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is ubiquitous in human genes, resulting in mRNA diversity, and has been validated to play a pivotal regulatory role in the onset and progression of a variety of diseases, including viral infections. Here, we analyzed the APA usage across different cell types in frontal cortex cells from non-viral control group and COVID-19 patients, and identified functionally related APA events in COVID-19. According to our study, the poly(A) site (PAS) usage is different among cell types and following SARS-COV-2 infection. Moreover, we found the genes with significant PAS level changes affected pathways related to RNA splicing, and neuronal development and function, suggesting that survivors of COVID-19 will have a high risk of these diseases and that alternative splicing functions cause these changes. Additionally, APA usage and its correlation with gene expression levels varied across genes, some prefer short isoform that is more stable to produce more proteins, while others may be regulated by different mechanisms. A total of 267 risk genes targeted by microRNAs for common neurological and psychiatric disorders were found to undergo significant changes in APA following infection. In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of APA in neural cells from COVID-19 patients at the single-cell level elucidated changes in APA levels in the brains of SARS-COV-2-infected patients and confirmed that these changes impair the function of the nervous system, providing important insights for COVID-19-associated sequelae. Highlights We analyzed the changes in single-cell APA level in the frontal cortex after SARS-COV-2 infection and found that PAS usage is different among cell types and changed after infection. We find that APA changes are related to RNA splicing, and neuronal development and function, such as synaptic plasticity, nervous system development, learning or memory and cognition, and the brain function may be impaired due to global gene expression and APA changes. A total of 267 risk genes for common neurological and psychiatric disorders were found to undergo significant changes in APA following infection, implying that APA alterations in specific genes could be a potential therapeutic target and predictive biomarker for neurological and psychiatric disease. APA in infection samples results in the removal/addition of miRNA target sites in the 3′-UTR of genes. A total of 2404 miRNAs were predicted which suggests that the miRNAs’ target site information can indicate the impact of APA events and has the potential to be used as a predictive biomarker.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has posed significant healthcare challenges. In addition to respiratory complications, it has led to severe damage in other organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Of which, myocardial injury is increasingly recognized as a most significant complication, contributing to the high mortality. Recent research indicates the pivotal role of immune dysregulation in mediating myocardial injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the immune mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced myocardial damage, focusing on the roles of key immune cells and molecules that contribute to this pathological process. Aiming at mitigating the myocardial injury of COVID-19, we review immune-based treatments under evaluation in preclinical and clinical trials. Along with talking about the similarities and differences in myocardial injury resulting from SARS-CoV-2, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This article provides a unique perspective on using past experiences to prevent myocardial injury in the face of ongoing virus mutations.">

        <tr id="Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with new-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The overall goal of this study is to uncover how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD to inform the identification of at-risk patients and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Transcriptomics analysis of 43 PD pathogenic genes was conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID-19 patients with varying severity including 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU, and 17 ICU patients, compared to 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The study shows that COVID-19 severity gradient differentially dysregulates PD pathological genes. Dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients was identified as the convergent network of COVID-19—PD interactions. These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system in ICU COVID-19 patients. A potential synergistic co-expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes was observed in ICU patients, indicating a possible overlap in biological pathways. Dysregulation of the PD pathopharmacogene, SLC6A3 was observed in ICU patients, suggesting potential COVID-19-gene-drug interactions. Nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes, which could advance studies on PD, including diagnosis, pathogenesis, and the development of disease-modifying treatments. Outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients may face a higher risk of developing new-onset PD, whereas ICU COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19-gene-drug interactions.

        <tr id="Neuroaxonal injury is a major driver of irreversible disability in demyelinating conditions. Accurate assessment of the association between demyelination and axonal pathology is critical for evaluating and developing effective therapeutic approaches. Measuring neurofilament light chain (NfL) in blood could putatively allow longitudinal monitoring of neuroaxonal injury at "single protein resolution" with high pathological specificity. Here, we demonstrate a robust association between blood and tissue NfL-based assessment of neuroaxonal injury and severity of inflammatory demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). In EAE, high levels of NfL were evident at peak of demyelination and correlated with tissue evidence of NfL loss when using antibodies that target the same NfL epitopes. In addition, we validate the longitudinal NfL dynamics in relation to de- and remyelination in an inducible genetic model of inflammatory-independent myelin loss. Through inducible knockout of myelin regulatory protein (Myrf) in proteolipid protein (PLP) expressing cells in Myrffl/fl PLP1-CreERT (MyrfΔiPLP) mice, serum NfL peaked at time of demyelination and were reduced following effective remyelination. In people with multiple sclerosis, the most common demyelinating condition, we confirmed the association between NfL and myelin breakdown proteins in two independent cohorts using Olink proximity extension assays, the ReBUILD clinical trial, and the MS participants in the UK-Biobank. Our study provides a translational framework to understand the biology behind NfL changes in the context of de- and remyelination and reveals novel aspects related to monitoring potentially reversible neuroaxonal pathology in humans and rodents.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes infiltrate the CNS in response to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and form a pool of long-lived brain tissue-resident memory T-cells (bTRMs), which display markers of residency (i.e., CD103, CD69, CD49a). However, the functional role of these bTRMs is still unknown. By 30 days postinfection, a latent viral brain infection was established, as indicated by absence of viral transcripts (IE1, E1, and gB) produced during productive infection. Following intracerebroventricular injection of either depleting α-CD8 Ab (clone YTS169.4) or α-CD103-sap (clone IT50) into the brain, 90–95% T-cell depletion was achieved. Using luciferase-expressing mice, we observed recommenced imaging signals indicative of de novo MCMV IE promoter activity in depleted animals. Surprisingly, using an explant assay, we efficiently recovered reactivatable, infectious virus from untreated, latent animals, but not from those depleted of bTRMs (viral recovery in explants was reduced from 100% to 50% by day 21). We identified Lgals3 (galectin 3), Gpnmb (glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B) and Hmox1 (heme oxygenase 1) as genes that were most upregulated in bTRM-depleted groups. When bTRMs were depleted, there was transient expression of viral IE genes which resulted in antiviral microglia with a phagocytic, disease-associated (DAM) or neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype. These data provide new insights into the role of bTRMs in controlling both CNS reactivation and driving microglial phenotypes.">

While HIV infection induces progressive CD4+ T cell depletion and chronic immune dysfunction, SARS-CoV-2 triggers complex host responses, ranging from localized antiviral defense to systemic hyperinflammation. We aimed to illustrate the plasma proteomic profiles of hospitalized patients coinfected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2.Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze the plasma protein profiles in three matched groups: (1) seven hospitalized patients with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, (2) seven people living with HIV (PLWH) who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and (3) seven healthy controls. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed on the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs).We quantified 5,373 proteins across 21 samples and identified significant alterations in multiple proteins in people living with HIV (PLWH) with COVID-19 compared to both PLWH and healthy controls. These DEPs were associated with inflammatory responses, immune cell migration, degranulation, and, notably, the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition, we identified DEPs associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral receptors, proteases, transcription factors, and kinases.The proteomic profile highlighted the disruption caused by COVID-19 in immunomodulation, thrombosis, and viral entry pathways in PLWH. Further validation of these signatures could improve risk stratification and tailored interventions for this vulnerable patient cohort.">

        <tr id="Lead exposure is of high prevalence, and over a billion people are chronically exposed to alarming level of lead. Human immune system is highly vulnerable to lead, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Using single-cell mass cytometry and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we performed a panoramic survey of lead targets at both cellular and molecular levels in murine immune system upon chronic lead exposure. We produced a single-cell landscape of lead, thiol metabolism and lead-induced toxicity across all immune cell types. We found that immune cells with extreme thiol metabolism are the most sensitive upon chronic lead exposure. It shows that CD4 + T cells and neutrophils are the most sensitive to lead, which is due respectively to a molecular mechanism rooted in their characteristic thiol metabolic capacity. Meanwhile, we found that lead accumulation by RBC further inflicted secondary toxicity to RBC phagocytes in spleen, e.g. macrophages and neutrophils. Unlike CD4 + T cells, which can be rescued by supplementation with thiol chelator, lead toxicity in these phagocytes cannot be effectively mitigated by thiol chelators. Overall, it forms a multiscale panoramic lead-immune system interactome upon chronic lead exposure, which provides valuable information for proactive prevention, therapy formulation and public health evaluation. Graphical abstract Graphical headlights Established a lead-immune system interactome across cellular and molecular level. Thiol metabolic heterogeneity leads to diversified molecular mechanisms of toxicity in different immune cells. Thiol chelator can only mitigate lead toxicity in CD4 + T cells but not splenic RBC phagocytes.

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a complex, multifactorial condition characterized by persistent symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks following acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, but chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and viral persistence are increasingly being implicated. This study investigated the immunopathological drivers of long COVID-19 and their associations with clinical manifestations and organ damage. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 200 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-65 years, in which immune markers, autoantibody profiles, lymphocyte dysfunction, and imaging findings were assessed over a 12-month period. Persistent inflammation was observed, with elevated interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α ± levels correlated with lung fibrosis and cognitive impairment. Autoantibodies were detected in 40% of the participants, particularly those with cardiovascular and neurological symptoms. A significant reduction in CD8+ T-cell counts was associated with severe fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, whereas persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in 10% of cases, primarily in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms. Imaging studies revealed multiorgan involvement, with structural abnormalities in the lungs, heart, and brain. These findings highlight the interplay of immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity in long-term COVID-19, underscoring the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to address its long-term health impacts.">

We measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines viz. TNF-alpha, Interleukin-6 and Interferon-gamma. The initiation of immune system against viral infection involves role of cytokines. In Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, high levels of cytokine were observed which led to severity in immune-compromised patients, elderly and even mildly infected patients. High levels of cytokines have not only been observed in SARS-CoV-2 but are also prevalent in other human coronavirus infections. There are other respiratory diseases occurring in the form of epidemics and outbreaks in all parts of the world, yet understanding of the fact that when system gets infected by more than one respiratory virus, the cytokine expression observed has not been looked upon.

This is irrespective of the fact that antibodies may already be present against respiratory diseases within the system over the course of time. We hereby hypothesise that if cytokine storm due to such condition may lead to activation of Th1/Th2 response, develop severity/complications and ultimately may lead to lung damage. In this study, we measured the cytokine response profiles (TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 and IFN-gamma) in patients with respiratory viral infections and we observed that TNF-α is the main factor contributing to cytokine storm and that hyper innate immune response is brought by mucosal immunity during infection by SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Introduction There are significant challenges remain in accurately categorizing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients. Objectives We used an untargeted 1H NMR-based metabolomics to assess the metabolomic changes in serum samples from a Danish cohort of 106 COVID-19-infected patients with mild to fatal disease courses and from patients with fatal outcomes from other diseases. Methods In total, 240 serum samples were used for this study. We used the data for multiple analyses (1) to construct a predictive model for disease severity and outcome, (2) to identify prognostic markers for subsequent disease severity and outcome, and (3) to understand the disease consequences in the metabolome and how recovery or death is reflected in the altered biological pathways. Results Our results revealed distinct alterations in the serum metabolome that could differentiate patients with COVID-19 by severity (mild or severe) or outcome (death or survival). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and four machine learning algorithms (random forest, linear support vector machine, PLS-DA, and logistic regression), we identified two biomarker sets with relevant biological functions that predict subsequent disease severity and patient outcome. The range of these severity-associated biomarkers was equally broad and included inflammatory markers, amino acids, fluid balance, ketone bodies, glycolysis-related metabolites, lipoprotein particles, and fatty acid levels. Conclusions Our data suggest the potential benefits of broader testing of these metabolites from newly diagnosed patients to predict which COVID-19 patients will progress to severe disease and which patients will manifest severe symptoms to minimize mortality.

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been linked to long-term neurological effects with multifaceted complications of neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have found that pathological changes in transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) are involved in these cases. This review explores the causal interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and TDP-43 from multiple perspectives. Some viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to induce pathological changes in TDP-43 through its cleavage, aggregation, and mislocalization. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause liquid−liquid phase separation and stress granule formation, which accelerate the condensation of TDP-43, resulting in host RNA metabolism disruption. TDP-43 has been proposed to interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, though its role in viral replication remains to be fully elucidated. This interaction potentially facilitates viral replication, while viral-induced oxidative stress and protease activity accelerate TDP-43 pathology. Evidence from both clinical and experimental studies indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to long-term neurological sequelae, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like and frontotemporal dementia-like features, as well as increased phosphorylated TDP-43 deposition in the central nervous system. Biomarker studies further support the link between TDP-43 dysregulation and neurological complications of long-term effects of COVID-19 (long COVID). In this review, we presented a novel integrative framework of TDP-43 pathology, bridging a gap between SARS-CoV-2 infection and mechanisms of neurodegeneration. These findings underscore the need for further research to clarify the TDP-43-related neurodegeneration underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and to develop therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating long-term neurological effects in patients with long COVID.">

        <tr id="The rapid worldwide transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to severe cases of hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and ultimately death. Small-scale molecular interactions have been analyzed by focusing on several genes/single genes, providing important insights; however, genome-wide multi-omics comprehensive molecular interactions have not yet been well investigated with the exception of GWAS and eQTLm, both of which show genetic risks. From April of 2020 until now, we have created a Japan-wide system, initially named the Japan COVID-19 Task Force. This system has collected more than 6500 COVID-19 patients’ peripheral blood and as much associated clinical information as possible from a network of more than 120 hospitals. DNA, RNA, serum, and plasma were extracted and stored in this bank. This study unravels the interplay of inflammatory gene networks that induce different COVID-19 severity levels (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) by using multi-omics data from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force. We analyze RNA and protein expressions to estimate severity-specific inflammation networks that uncover the interplay between RNA and protein networks via ligand–receptor pairs. Our large-scale RNA/protein expression data analysis reveals that the atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2) acts as a key broker linking RNA and protein inflammation networks to induce COVID-19 critical severity. ACKR2 emerges in RNA and protein inflammation networks, showing active interplay in high-severity cases and weak interactions in mild cases. The results also show severity-specific molecular interactions between interleukin (IL), cytokine receptor activity, cell adhesion, and interactions involving the CC chemokine ligand (CCL) gene family and ACKR2.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 776 million confirmed cases and more than 7 million deaths worldwide. In addition to humans, various animal species have exhibited natural infections, with mink being the only farmed animals consistently linked to severe illness and zoonotic transmission to humans. This study investigates histological pulmonary lesions in Danish farm mink infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), focusing on groups with different clinical signs and outcomes. Results Histopathological evaluations revealed lesions in SARS-CoV-2-positive mink with and without clinical signs of disease. The main findings in lungs from SARS-CoV-2-positive mink in all study groups were extensive respiratory epithelial damage, acute diffuse alveolar damage, and vascular lesions, including the formation of thrombi. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of viral particles primarily in the respiratory epithelia. Lymphoid cells exhibited nodular and perivascular aggregates similar to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in older SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected mink, indicating a potential age-related feature of mink lungs. Conclusions The presence of subclinical and long-term pulmonary lesions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in farm mink suggests that the impact of outbreaks may be more serious than clinical signs records indicate. The current SARS-CoV-2 surveillance system on Danish mink farms does not properly address such problems and repeated outbreaks on farms could occur without detection if there are no clinical signs or increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2. The severity of subclinical lesions reveals hidden health and welfare challenges in mink, underscoring the need for improved prevention measures, surveillance and understanding of long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mink.

        <tr id="Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection poses a global public health challenge, especially in infants and young children, with severe cases leading to fatal consequences. EV71 infection modulates various biological processes of the host and evades host immunity through multiple mechanisms. The balance of mitochondrial dynamics is important for cellular homeostasis. However, the mechanisms underlying EV71‐induced cellular damage via mitophagy remain unclear. In the current study, we showed that EV71 infection significantly reduced the total and mitochondrial ATP contents in cells, as well as the expression of mitochondrial proteins TOM20 and TIM23. Then, EV71 infection increased the protein levels of PINK1, Parkin, and LC3B, suggesting that EV71 infection triggers the mitophagy. Silencing PINK1 caused a significant reduction in viral replication, while overexpressing Parkin promoted the replication of EV71. Moreover, CsA treatment, as a mitophagy inhibitor, alleviated pathological damage and suppressed the replication of EV71 in vivo. Mechanistic study showed that silencing PINK1 inhibited the cleavage of MAVS by EV71, while overexpressing Parkin enhanced the cleavage of MAVS by EV71, suggesting that PINK1‐mediated mitophagy was involved in regulating innate immunity. Furthermore, we found that EV71 infection promoted the release of mitochondria carrying EV71 virions into the extracellular environment, which mediated infection of other cells, thus facilitating virus spreading. In addition, we also demonstrated that the extracellular mitochondria induced the degradation of MAVS and mitophagy promoted the release of mitochondria in EV71‐infected HeLa cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that EV71 infection induces PINK1‐mediated mitophagy, which inhibits innate immunity and facilitates virus replication.">

        <tr id="In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a systemic host response to infection with life-threatening consequence which ranks among the top ten causes of death worldwide. Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular and cellular impact of sepsis remains rudimentary. Methods A mouse sepsis model was established through LPS induction and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect T helper 1 (Th1) cell subsets and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in septic mice. Additionally, in vivo neutralization experiments were conducted to block IFN-γ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, to explore the regulatory effect of DOCK2 on septic mice. Finally, the regulatory mechanism of DOCK2 was analyzed using an in vivo RNA-seq system. Results We identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a critical downregulating factor for LPS signal pathways. DOCK2-deficient mice were highly sensitive to LPS-induced sepsis and E. coli sepsis with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-γ which were mainly due to hyperresponsive Th1 cells. Ulteriorly, we verified the vital role of DOCK2-mediated Th1 cells in sepsis by neutralizing both IFN-γ and CD4 and found both of which blockade reduced the severity of sepsis in Dock2−/− mice. Mechanically, DOCK2-mediated cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling act in concert to govern peripheral Th1 cell fate. Conclusion Our data indicates that DOCK2 acts as a protective role in regulating systemic inflammation and multi-organ injury in bacterial sepsis by constraining Th1 response. These findings provide new targets for immunomodulatory therapy of sepsis, suggesting that targeting the DOCK2-Th1 axis may become a new strategy to improve systemic inflammatory responses associated with bacterial infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT A liver involvement in Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) has been frequently observed in patients hospitalised for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection during 2020; in such cases, the clinical and prognostic relevance of hepatocellular damage has been widely acknowledged. On the other hand, there is less extensive evidence of liver injury (LI) in the subsequent waves of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of LI and to determine the clinical, biochemical, and immune‐virologic characteristics associated with its development in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients hospitalised in 2021–2022. This single‐centre retrospective study included 455 patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and respiratory failure. LI was defined by the detection of transaminase levels exceeding three times the upper limit of normality (ULN) and was further classified as early or late liver injury based on whether the peak transaminase value occurred within or after 7 days from hospital admission. LI was found in 17.6% (80/455) of the overall cohort, while early liver injury (ELI) and late liver injury (LLI) were detected in 10.4% and 11.5%, respectively. LI was associated with younger age, elevated inflammatory and tissue damage markers, with the presence of chronic liver disease (CLD), and with the use of interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) inhibitors. Patients with LI had a higher probability of severe COVID‐19, transfer to intensive care unit, and in‐hospital death than those without. In multivariable analysis, younger age, administration of IL‐6 inhibitors, and the presence of higher gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were independently related to the development of overall LI, whereas in‐hospital mortality was independently correlated with the occurrence of LLI. The occurrence of hepatocellular damage therefore has been associated with a pro‐inflammatory profile and with worse overall outcomes but not with increased likelihood of liver failure or liver‐related mortality.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to persistent or newly emerging symptoms lasting for months, a condition known as long COVID (LC). The pathophysiology of LC remains poorly understood, with cytokine dysregulation proposed as a key mechanism, although findings across the studies have been inconsistent. Patients and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study using the Olink® Target 96 Inflammation Panel to assess cytokines in COVID-19 (COV) patients at three months and six months post-infection. These profiles were compared with those of individuals recovering from other upper respiratory tract infections (non-COV). Additionally, we analyzed differences between individuals with LC and those who recovered from COVID-19. Predictive models for LC at three months and sixth months post-infection were developed using inflammatory markers and relevant clinical cofactors, including gender, age, BMI, hemogram, Β2-microglobulin, D-dimers, LDH, AST, ALT, Ferritin, vitamin D, CRP, and the severity of acute COVID-19 infection as classified by WHO criteria. Results: We observed a general decline in inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients over time, with only a few cytokines elevated (CCL4 at month 3 and CST5 at month 6) compared to non-COV controls. In LC patients, an early phase of low-grade inflammation transitioned into significant reduction in proinflammatory biomarkers compared to recovered individuals. Rather than indicating immune normalization, this pattern suggests a possible suppression or exhaustion of the immune response in the months following acute infection. Importantly, our predictive modeling demonstrated that this specific cytokine signature, in combination with acute disease severity and clinical cofactors, described well the presence of LC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inflammation-related biomarker dysregulation following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection evolves dynamically over a six-month period. By the sixth month, compared to the third month, the presence of LC is more accurately predicted by a combination of persistent biomarker alteration and the severity of the initial infection, as defined by WHO criteria. This represents a novel insight, as previous studies have primarily associated LC with elevated proinflammatory markers, whereas our results suggest that immune suppression or exhaustion may play a more prominent role in the later stages.">

        <tr id="Background COVID-19 progression and recovery involve complex gene expression changes and immune dysregulation, but their dynamic alterations remain poorly understood. Current clinical indicators lack precision in distinguishing severe cases, highlighting the need for molecular biomarkers and diagnostic tools. Methods Three transcriptomic datasets were analyzed: 1) COVID-19 progression from Healthy, Moderate, Severe, to ICU patients; 2) recovery stages (1, 3, and 6 months) compared to Healthy controls; and 3) COVID-19 ICU versus non-ICU patients. Differential expression analysis, immune cell infiltration estimation, machine learning (LASSO regression and random forest), and functional enrichment were used to identify key genes and molecular mechanisms. Results Gene expression analysis revealed dynamic changes during COVID-19 progression. Adaptive immune cells (e.g., B cells and T cells) decreased, while innate immune cells (e.g., monocytes and neutrophils) increased, particularly in ICU patients. Recovery analysis showed significantly reduced adaptive immune cells at 1 month, with partial recovery by 3 and 6 months. Machine learning identified CCR5, CYSLTR1, and KLRG1 as diagnostic biomarkers for distinguishing ICU from non-ICU patients, with AUC values of 0.916, 0.885, and 0.899, respectively. Conclusion This study identified CCR5, CYSLTR1, and KLRG1 as efficient diagnostic biomarkers for severe COVID-19 using machine learning and revealed immune regulatory features across COVID-19 progression and recovery.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lipid metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of acute viral infections by affecting viral replication and the host immune response. In contrast, the role of host lipid metabolism during chronic viral infection has been less explored. The current study aims to define the role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a primary physiologic receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), during natural gammaherpesvirus infection. Gammaherpesviruses are highly prevalent cancer-associated pathogens that induce and manipulate germinal center responses to establish life-long infection of B cells. Importantly, gammaherpesvirus-infected germinal center B cells are thought to be the target of viral transformation. In this study, we found that global SR-BI deficiency led to increased gammaherpesvirus lytic gene expression in the lungs during the acute stage of infection. Chronic gammaherpesvirus infection of the SR-BI-deficient host was associated with exaggerated germinal center responses and increased differentiation of self-reactive B cells that persisted during the long-term stage of chronic infection. Interestingly, SR-BI-deficient germinal center B cells, although more numerous, failed to support efficient gammaherpesvirus infection. The exaggerated germinal center response was also observed following immunization of the SR-BI-deficient host, unveiling the novel role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of physiological and gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center responses. IMPORTANCE Lipid metabolism affects diverse acute viral infections. In contrast, less is known about the effect of lipid metabolism on chronic virus infection, including in the context of an intact host. Host lipid homeostasis is maintained via a combination of endogenous lipid synthesis that takes place in most cell types and cellular interaction with exogenous, circulating lipids. This study focuses on defining the interaction between SR-BI, a primary HDL receptor, and natural gammaherpesvirus infection. We found that SR-BI deficiency led to increased expression of lytic gammaherpesvirus genes during acute gammaherpesvirus replication in the lungs. Importantly, chronic gammaherpesvirus infection unveiled the physiological role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of the germinal center response, a B cell differentiation process that is critical for physiological B cell responses and that is manipulated by gammaherpesviruses to establish chronic infection.

        <tr id="Aging induces significant alterations in the immune system, with immunosenescence contributing to age-related diseases. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) offer a convenient and comprehensive snapshot of the body's immune status. In this study, we performed an integrated analysis of PBMCs using both bulk-cell and single-cell RNA-seq data, spanning from children to frail elderlies, to investigate age-related changes. We observed dynamic changes in the PBMC transcriptome during healthy aging, including dramatic shifts in inflammation, myeloid cells, and lymphocyte features during early life, followed by relative stability in later stages. Conversely, frail elderly individuals exhibited notable disruptions in peripheral immune cells, including an increased senescent phenotype in monocytes with elevated inflammatory cytokine expression, heightened effector activation in regulatory T cells, and functional impairment of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of immunosenescence, elucidating the mechanisms driving abnormal inflammation and immunosuppression in frailty.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) infection is known to cause hand-foot-mouth disease, which may develop severe symptoms such as encephalitis, herpangina, and paralysis, leading to pulmonary edema and even death in children under five years old. Existing animal models for EV-A71 pathogenesis have limitations, necessitating novel models to study human-relevant disease mechanisms. Using glycoproteomic profiling to identify EV-A71-interacting proteins, we previously discovered human nucleolin (hNCL) as an attachment molecule that enhances viral binding and infection in vitro. Here, we developed human nucleolin transgenic (hNCL-Tg) mice to investigate EV-A71 pathogenesis in vivo. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, EV-A71-infected hNCL-Tg mice exhibited higher clinical scores, progressive limb paralysis, and increased mortality. Six days post-infection, hNCL-Tg mice showed elevated viral loads in the spinal cord and skeletal muscle, with pronounced EV-A71 VP1 expression in these tissues and the brainstem. Histopathology revealed severe skeletal muscle damage and significant pulmonary edema, characterized by lung congestion, hemorrhage, and erythrocyte infiltration into alveoli. Infected hNCL-Tg mice also displayed elevated levels of encephalitis- and pulmonary edema-associated proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-13). These findings establish the hNCL-Tg mouse as a robust model for studying EV-A71 pathogenesis and evaluating preclinical therapeutics.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global health crisis, with many patients experiencing not only acute neurological and sensory symptoms but also persistent sensory abnormalities, commonly referred to as long COVID sequelae. The mechanisms underlying somatosensory abnormalities induced by SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein in pain regulation. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 N protein exacerbates pathological pain in mouse models of bone cancer, chemotherapy, neuropathic, and inflammatory, and promotes the chronification of acute inflammatory pain. We also identify a potential interaction between the N protein and Nav1.7 in dorsal root ganglion neurons from mice, monkeys, and humans. Furthermore, the N protein significantly increases Nav1.7 currents in dorsal root ganglion neurons from both mice and monkeys by delaying Nav1.7 inactivation without altering its expression or membrane trafficking. This modulation of Nav1.7 function by the N protein not only intensifies pain hypersensitivity but also prolongs the duration of pain, potentially facilitating the transition from acute to chronic pain. Our findings underscore the importance of vigilant management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with pathological pain and suggest potential therapeutic targets for mitigating COVID-19-related pain.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has a diverse spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe and critical cases that result in the death of the patient. Alongside the viral factors host factors like Age, deregulation of the immune response and presence of comorbidity determine the patient’s outcome. Here we sought to assess the impact of age on natural antibody response, CBC-based inflammatory markers, and outcome of COVID-19 patients. We divided the participants into three groups, young (≤ 35 years), middle-aged (40–60 years), and old (≥ 65 years) patients and collected and analyzed sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. We found that elderly patients showed higher (P < 0.05) levels of inflammation like increased neutrophil percentages, NLR, lymphopenia, and low Hgb levels, compared to middle-aged and young patients. Interestingly these markers were also associated with mortality of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in ion concentration, lipid profile, and coagulation test between the three age groups. We also found that elderly patients showed significantly (P < 0.05) decreased levels of natural antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the two groups. Lastly, we assessed the effect of dexamethasone treatment, even if statistically not significant (P > 0.05) we observed a positive trend among patients under dexamethasone in the aspect of decreasing inflammatory markers. To conclude we showed that SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by an age-dependent deregulation of inflammatory markers that are associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients.

        <tr id="Introduction Microvascular injury is central to the pathophysiology of sepsis, but its interaction with the immune system in early infection is unclear. This study aimed to phenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from emergency department (ED) patients with suspected bacterial infection and correlate the results with microvascular changes. Methods This prospective observational study included 49 adult ED patients with suspected infection and 17 healthy controls. Capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions were measured by sublingual microscopy, while peripheral blood immune cell subsets were analyzed by deep flow cytometry. Results Network visualization of 72 diIerentially regulated parameters revealed specific changes in diIerent immune cell subsets. Innate immune changes included a functional diversion of monocytes towards pathogen defense and tissue repair, whereas adaptive immune changes included the development of CD4+ T cells with Th2-profile and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct immune endotypes: E1 with a suppressed immune response and higher disease severity, and E2 with an enhanced immune response and lower disease severity. Patients showed significant reductions in capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions, which were neither correlated in magnitude nor associated with endotypes. There was a strong association between damaged glycocalyx and several monocyte and T-cell subsets. This association was not observed for capillary density. Discussion We demonstrate that glycocalyx damage is associated with a unique immunological signature, distinct from functional capillary density. These findings provide a strong basis for future studies of immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction in infection.">

The aim of this study was to quantify cytokines, chemokines, and acute phase proteins in the plasma of patients with COVID-19 to elucidate potential biomarkers to inform prognostic and treatment decisions. Clustering analysis using the K-prototypes method identified underlying biological patterns in patients with COVID-19. The penalized multinomial logistic regression analysis identified two comorbidities (hypertension, congestive heart failure) and thirteen analytes as potential risk factors for COVID-19 progression with 88.2% accuracy. Based on a patient’s age, high concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and pentraxin 3 were important biomarkers for lethal COVID-19. Decreased concentrations of interferon gamma-induced protein-10, IL-10, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I were found to be associated with mild COVID-19, while increasing concentrations of these analytes could be used to predict COVID-19 severity.">

 Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ended, the enduring health impacts of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continue to garner global attention, as approximately 10% of patients develop long COVID (post COVID-19 condition). The epidemiological characteristics and symptoms of long COVID have been reported, and various pathogenic hypotheses have been proposed. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids or fragments persist in some patients post-infection and that these are correlated with long COVID symptoms. This review focuses on clinical studies linking SARS-CoV-2 persistence to long COVID symptoms, and explores the relationship between viral persistence and other etiological hypotheses, such as immune dysregulation, vascular issues, coagulation dysfunction, microbiome dysbiosis, brainstem/vagus nerve signaling dysfunction, and latent virus reactivation. Futhermore, treatment strategies for long COVID are proposed based on current clinical trials of antiviral and immune modulation therapies. Understanding the role of viral persistence in long COVID pathogenesis is critical for developing targeted therapies and improving clinical management of this debilitating condition.

After analysis, 14 223 genes had sufficient hits; 18 genes and 431 genes were differentially expressed between patients with and without COVID‐19 and patients with and without diabetes, respectively. Both analyses had differentially expressed five genes, GRASP, KRT8, MYZAP, PRKG1, and SMIM24. DPP‐IV concentrations were statistically lower in COVID‐19 patients versus non‐COVID‐19, but no significant differences in chemokine/cytokine expression and ACE2 concentrations were detected.

        <tr id="The pathology of severe COVID-19 is due to a hyperinflammatory immune response persisting after viral clearance. To understand how the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is regulated to avoid severe COVID-19, we tested relevant immunoregulatory cytokines. TGF-β, IL-10 and IL-4 were neutralized upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (CMA3p20), a model of mild disease; and lung inflammation was quantified by histology and flow cytometry at early and late time points. Mild weight loss, and lung inflammation including consolidation and alveolar thickening were evident 3 days post-infection (dpi) and inflammation persisted to 7 dpi. Coinciding with early monocytic infiltrates, CCL2 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were transiently produced 3 dpi, while IL-12 and CCL5 persisted to 7 dpi, modeling viral and inflammatory phases of disease. Neutralization of TGF-β, but not IL-10 or IL-4, significantly increased lung inflammatory monocytes and elevated serum but not lung IL-6. Neutralization of IL-4 prolonged weight loss and increased early perivascular infiltration without changing viral titer. Anti-IL-4 reduced expression of Arg1, a gene associated with alternative activation of macrophages. Neutralizing TGF-β and IL-4 had differential effects on pathology after virus control. Lung perivascular infiltration was reduced 7 dpi by neutralization of IL-4 or TGF-β, and peri-airway inflammation was affected by anti-TGF-β, while alveolar infiltrates were not affected by either. Anti-IL-4 prolonged IL-12 to 7 dpi along with reduced IL-10 in lungs. Overall, the immunoregulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-4 dampen initial inflammation in this maSARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that promotion of immunoregulation could help patients in early stages of disease.

        <tr id="Rat post-mitotic septal neurons, engineered to reversibly proliferate and arrest under physiological conditions, can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine representative independent cDNA libraries were made to evaluate global arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses, e.g., upregulated interferon (β-IFN) RNA, that were previously identified in normal uninfected and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent (CJ) infected septal neurons. This reversible cell model encompassed a non-productive latent (CJ−) and a highly infectious (CJ + , 10 logs/gm) state. Arrest of normal uninfected neurons upregulated a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts and known neuronal differentiation transcripts (e.g., Neuregulin-1, GDF6 and Prnp). As expected, many activated IFN innate immune genes were simultaneously upregulated (e.g., OAS1, ISG20, CD80, cytokines, chemokines and complement) along with clusterin (CLU) that binds misfolded proteins. Arrest of latently infected CJ− cells induced even more profound global transcript differences. CJ+ cells markedly downregulated the anti-proliferative controls seen in arrested normal cells. CJ+ infection also suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ infection. In contrast, IFN and cytokine/chemokine pathways were strongly upregulated. Analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection enhances and expands anti-viral responses; 3) non-productive latent infection can epigenetically imprint many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. This rare cell model of latent infection is fundamental for interrogating triggers of late onset disease that are also relevant for Alzheimer’s Disease. Peripheral human blood and intestinal myeloid cells that are latently infected may also be conditionally stimulated in vitro to produce CJ+ linked diagnostic transcripts.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Mast cells (MCs) are strategically located at the interface between host and environment. The non-allergic functions of MCs in immunosurveillance against pathogens have been recently underscored. However, the activation of MCs by pathogens may beneficially or detrimentally regulate immune inflammation to combat or promote pathogen invasion. We and others have conclusively demonstrated that MCs serve as a crucial mediator in the induction of hyperinflammation initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to substantial tissue damage across multiple organs in murine and nonhuman primate models. Whereas the precise mechanism underlying virus-induced MC activation and degranulation remains largely elusive, our previous findings have indicated that the binding of the Spike proteins to cellular receptors is sufficient to elicit MC activation for rapid degranulation. This study aims to corroborate the ubiquity of coronavirus-induced MC degranulation and elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the activation of MCs upon Spike protein binding to the cellular receptors. Our transcriptome analysis revealed MC activation upon the stimulations with a range of Spike/RBD proteins and viral particles of coronavirus. Notably, the interaction between these Spike/RBD proteins and cellular receptors triggered the activation of src kinase, a member of Src Family Kinases (SFKs). This activation, in turn, stimulated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, resulting in an accumulation of intracellular calcium ions. These calcium ions subsequently facilitated microtubule-dependent granule transport, ultimately promoting MC degranulation. In summary, this study elucidates the mechanism underlying virus-triggered activation of MCs and has the potential to aid in the development of MC-targeted antiviral therapeutic strategies. IMPORTANCE The activation and degranulation of mast cells (MCs), triggered by a variety of viruses, are intricately linked to viral pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Aging has a profound impact on the immune system, leading to a gradual decline in its function and increased systemic inflammation, collectively known as immunosenescence and inflammaging. These changes make older adults more susceptible to infections, including COVID‐19, and contribute to worse clinical outcomes, such as higher morbidity and mortality rates. This review explores immunological changes associated with aging, including impaired innate immune responses, reduced T‐ and B‐cell function, and altered cytokine profiles. A comprehensive literature search identified relevant studies on the topic, and inclusion criteria focused on studies addressing age‐related immune changes and their impact on responses to COVID‐19. The findings underscore the need for targeted healthcare strategies to mitigate the negative effects of aging on immunity and improve immune resilience, and ultimately clinical outcomes and quality of life for this vulnerable population.">

        <tr id="The role of immune metabolism, specific metabolites and cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic metabolic states across the time course of an inflammatory response are emerging knowledge. Targeted and untargeted metabolomic analysis is essential to understand how immune cells adapt their metabolic program throughout an immune response. In addition, metabolomic analysis can aid to identify pathophysiological patterns in inflammatory disease. Here, we discuss new metabolomic findings within the transition from inflammation to resolution, focusing on three key programs of immunity: Efferocytosis, IL-10 signaling and trained immunity. Particularly the tryptophan-derived metabolite kynurenine was identified as essential for efferocytosis and inflammation resolution as well as a potential biomarker in diverse inflammatory conditions. In summary, metabolomic analysis and integration with transcriptomic and proteomic data, high resolution imaging and spatial information is key to unravel metabolic drivers and dependencies during inflammation and progression to tissue-repair.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common non-infectious inflammatory CNS disease, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and focal demyelinated lesions. Traditionally considered an autoimmune disease, MS is driven by the immune system's attack on CNS myelin, resulting in cumulative disability. However, conventional anti-inflammatory treatments often fail to prevent progressive deterioration, particularly in the absence of overt inflammation, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis. Recent research has revealed a more complex disease mechanism involving both peripheral immune responses and intrinsic CNS factors, with glial cells playing a central role. Persistent inflammation in MS is associated with mixed active/inactive lesions dominated by microglia and astrocyte dysregulation. These glial populations exhibit maladaptive activation, contributing to failed remyelination and ongoing neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations as well as aging further exacerbate glial dysfunction, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation and damage. Emerging evidence suggests that the interplay between peripheral immune cells and glial populations and the potential dual-use nature of molecular tools shared by the immune system and CNS disrupts homeostatic signaling, leading to a loss of tissue integrity. This review synthesizes findings on glial cell biology in MS, with a focus on microglia and astrocytes, while addressing their roles in demyelination, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. The limitations of animal models, particularly EAE, in replicating the complexity of MS are also addressed. Finally, critical questions are outlined to guide future research into glial pathology and to identify novel therapeutic approaches targeting progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Introduction The H9N2 avian influenza virus, although not highly pathogenic, still poses ongoing risks to poultry health and food security due to its ability to resist vaccines and its potential to spread to humans. Methods This study investigated the effects of baicalin, a flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, on respiratory mucosal immunity during H9N2 infection. In vitro experiments were conducted using MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells, and in vivo evaluations were performed in a mouse model of H9N2 infection. Results Baicalin treatment enhanced the expression of antiviral proteins Mx1 and PKR in a dose- and time-dependent manner, helping to counteract the virus’s suppression of these defense proteins. In addition to strengthening this epithelial barrier, baicalin has both antiviral and immune-regulating effects: it directly blocks viral replication and helps restore the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in H9N2-infected mice. Most importantly, baicalin reduces lung damage and spleen shrinkage while keeping the immune system balanced. These results show that baicalin enhances mucosal antiviral defenses by simultaneously regulating innate antiviral pathways (Mx1 and PKR) and restoring adaptive immune balance (CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio). Discussion These dual protective effects highlight baicalin’s potential as a natural therapeutic strategy for improving mucosal immunity against vaccine-resistant influenza viruses such as H9N2, contributing valuable insights into plant-derived immunomodulatory approaches against emerging zoonotic viral threats.">

        <tr id="Background Neuropathological and clinical studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may increase the long-term risk of neurodegeneration. Methods We provide a narrative overview of pathological and clinical observations justifying the implementation of a surveillance program to monitor changes in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the years after COVID-19. Results Autopsy studies revealed diverse changes in the brain, including loss of vascular integrity, microthromboses, gliosis, demyelination, and neuronal- and glial injury and cell death, in both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals irrespective of the severity of COVID-19. Recent data suggest that microglia play an important role in sustained COVID-19-related inflammation, which contributes to the etiology initiating a neurodegenerative cascade, to the worsening of pre-existing neurodegenerative disease or to the acceleration of neurodegenerative processes. Histopathological data have been supported by neuroimaging, and epidemiological studies also suggested a higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases after COVID-19. Conclusions Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 during the pandemic, healthcare systems should be aware of, and be prepared for a potential increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the upcoming years. Strategies may include follow-up of well-described cohorts, analyses of outcomes in COVID-19-registries, nationwide surveillance programs using record-linkage of ICD-10 diagnoses, and comparing the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the post-pandemic periods to values of the pre-pandemic years. Awareness and active surveillance are particularly needed, because diverse clinical manifestations due to earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may no longer be quoted as post-COVID-19 symptoms, and hence, increasing incidence of neurodegenerative pathologies at the community level may remain unnoticed.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Long-term immunosuppressive therapy typically increases the risk of viral infection, yet during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients showed reduced severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility. This suggests potential overlapping molecular mechanisms between IBD and COVID-19 that warrant investigation.


METHODS
From April 2020 to April 2022, we enrolled 363 IBD patients and 146 healthy donors. Serum samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunoadsorption assay to determine the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and to measure concentrations of the host-soluble factors sACE2 and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which have SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity. Furthermore, colonic mucosa biopsies were analyzed by real-time PCR to confirm the upregulation of MBL2 as well as to assess the expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules (ie, ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, ADAM17, AGTR1).


RESULTS
Intestinal mucosa expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4 genes was significantly lower in IBD than in healthy individuals, regardless of the type of medication, while ADAM17 and AGT1R were similar across groups. Serum sACE2 levels changed minimally, whereas circulating MBL levels were significantly higher in CD and somewhat elevated in UC patients versus controls. Parallel trends in MBL2 gene expression were observed in IBD patients' intestinal mucosa.


CONCLUSIONS
Overall, our study indicates that the presence of higher basal circulating levels of MBL in CD patients and the decreased intestinal mucosa expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the host cell priming proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in both CD and UC patients may reduce COVID-19 risk, underscoring the potential protective role of these biomarkers in IBD populations against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 presents with a distinct immunological profile, characterized by elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts, seen commonly in fungal and bacterial infections. This study demonstrates that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 show evidence of neutrophil degranulation and have increased expression of neutrophil surface lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), a marker of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). Both early LOX-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on neutrophils were associated with development of severe disease. To determine whether tissue damage or inflammation is required to induce PMN-MDSCs or whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly activates neutrophils to become PMN-MDSCs, we incubated healthy human neutrophils with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly induced LOX-1 surface expression in healthy neutrophils independent of productive infection. LOX-1 induction was dependent on granule exocytosis and promoted up-regulation of reactive oxygen species, CD63, and PD-L1, enabling LOX-1+ neutrophils to suppress autologous T cell proliferation in vitro. These results support a role for PMN-MDSCs in mediating severe COVID-19, and inhibition of PD-L1 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the release of interferons (IFNs) and the proinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases. STAT3, a key protein in this pathway, has been implicated in promoting inflammation, making its inhibition a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles (MSC-EVs), enriched with immunomodulatory and antiviral miRNAs, offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating gene expression and regulating inflammatory responses. This study investigates the ability of Lyophilized MSC-EVs to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, highlighting their potential application in COVID-19 management.


METHODS
Male Syrian hamsters were used as an experimental model, housed under controlled laboratory conditions. SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020) was propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titers were determined using plaque assays. Hamsters were intranasally challenged with the virus and treated intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of lyophilized human Wharton's jelly-derived MSC-extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Histopathological evaluations were performed on lung tissues using H&E, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining. Morphometric analyses were conducted to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Western blotting was employed to evaluate protein expression. All procedures adhered to ethical and biosafety guidelines.


RESULTS
The administration of MSC-EVs significantly upregulated the expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-124, miRNA-155, miRNA-29b, miRNA-7, miRNA-145 and miRNA-18a compared to their levels in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a targeted release of miRNA-cargo from the MSC-EVs into the lung tissue of the animals. MSC-EVs impaired the activation of the STAT3/STAT1 signaling pathway and reduced the cytokine storm and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that MSC-EVs have the potential to effectively mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs and their clinical application in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY The mechanisms by which viruses enter host cells are crucial for their ability to infect and cause disease, serving as major targets for both host immune responses and therapeutic strategies. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry process is primarily driven by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, in conjunction with the activity of endosomal cathepsin L and the serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, recent scientific advances have expanded our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, uncovering alternative receptors and novel cofactors that may enhance viral tropism and adaptability. Given the critical role of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in mediating host cell entry, it has become a primary target for prevention and therapeutic strategies. However, the continuous spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of S protein variants that may potentially confer a fitness advantage or modify key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology, such as transmissibility, infectivity, antigenicity, and/or pathogenicity, posing significant challenges to the efficacy of current interventions. In this review, we provide an updated and comprehensive overview of the latest advances in SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways and molecular mechanisms, exploring their implications for antiviral drug discovery, vaccine design, and the development of other biomedical strategies while addressing the challenges posed by the ongoing evolution of the virus.">

 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory CNS disease with heterogeneous manifestation. Prognostic markers for early classification of MS are currently under investigation. Higher diagnostic resolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to contribute significantly to patient stratification, which should be especially important for a subgroup of patients with high risk to convert to a progressive disease course. This study aimed to determine whether spectral flow cytometry of CSF cells could identify pathogenic CD4+ T cell subset in MS. Using a two-step approach, we designed a marker panel informed by publicly available transcriptomic datasets from early human MS and our own single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine MS model. Notably, chronic (“phase”) markers such as Il7r and Ramp3 (associated with memory T cells), Itgb1 (integrin beta-1), and anti-apoptotic genes like Dnaja1, Hsph1, and Jun/AP-1 were enriched in EAE. These markers reflect pro-survival signaling and tissue-residency characteristics, including CXCR6, CD69, and Bhlhe40, which suggest an adaptation of CD4+ T cells toward persistent neuroinflammatory responses in chronic EAE. This phase-specific marker profile highlights CD4+ T cells as both indicators and contributors to disease progression in EAE. Translating these findings to MS datasets, we found an enrichment of phase-specific markers in CSF cells. Spectral flow cytometry in an independent MS cohort revealed distinct memory and effector T cell subsets, indicating unique CSF signatures in MS. This study underscores the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of CD4+ T cells detectable by spectral flow cytometry, enhancing diagnostic resolution of CSF cells and informing more precise therapeutic strategies for MS.">

        <tr id="Critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis exhibit distinct inflammatory phenotypes with divergent clinical outcomes and apparent heterogeneity of treatment effects, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. These phenotypes, derived from clinical data and protein biomarkers, were associated with metabolic differences in a prior pilot study. This study investigated the metabolomic and transcriptomic differences between Hyperinflammatory and Hypoinflammatory phenotypes through integrative multi-omics analysis of blood samples from ARDS patients in the ROSE trial. Multi-omics integration revealed three molecular signatures strongly associated with the Hyperinflammatory phenotype and with mortality: enhanced innate immune activation coupled with increased glycolysis, hepatic dysfunction and immune dysfunction paired with impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation, and interferon program suppression coupled with altered mitochondrial respiration. A fourth molecular signature, not associated with inflammatory phenotype, identified redox impairment and cell proliferation pathways associated with mortality. Integrated multi-omics analysis within each inflammatory phenotype revealed distinct pathways associated with mortality. All mortality-associated molecular signatures including those within phenotypes were validated in an independent cohort of critically ill patients with sepsis (EARLI). These findings reveal distinct molecular mechanisms underlying ARDS/sepsis phenotypes and suggest potential therapeutic targets for precise treatment strategies in critical illness.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic with far-reaching impacts on human activities. Moreover, direct viral damage and uncontrolled inflammation have been proposed as contributing factors to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is also well recognized for its capability to trigger and modulate the host’s innate immune system by attaching to bacterial substances. Nevertheless, the pandemic has further emphasized the critical role of an effective host immune response in controlling viral infection and highlighted the detrimental effect of immune dysregulation. This study aimed to assess plasma levels of LBP and inflammatory biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2 patients with different malnutrition status and severity levels. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh from December 2020 to December 2021. A total of 166 SARS-CoV-2 patients were recruited including 80 critical and 86 non-critical patients. Medical history, anthropometrical parameters, disease outcome information, and relevant biochemical parameters were extracted from medical records. Plasma samples were collected to test for LBP and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, nutritional risk was assessed by the Nutrition Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002) tool. Results: This cross-sectional study found no significant differences in LBP levels between critical and non-critical SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, LBP levels significantly correlated with IL-10, TNF-α and IL-6/IL-10 levels (Spearman’s rho = 0.430, 0.276 and −0.397 respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study confirmed the elevated inflammatory cytokines in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and their association with disease severity and malnutrition. These findings may support the mechanism of gut inflammation in order to develop new interventions that lower inflammatory biomarkers, disease severity, and aid in SARS-CoV-2 prevention and management.">

        <tr id="The incidence rate of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is rising. However, the pathogenesis of CAPA remains unclear. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disrupts pathways related to type I interferon and Toll-like receptors, key components in innate immunity, thereby elevating the incidence of CAPA. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in T and B cell functional deficiencies or exhaustion within adaptive immunity, weakening the defense against invasive Aspergillus. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances the replication of cytomegalovirus and alters the gut microbiota, factors that may aid in diagnosing CAPA. Immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 patients is also believed to heighten the risk of invasive aspergillosis. Therefore, this review, examines the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with invasive aspergillosis, and explores the pathogenesis and susceptibility factors of CAPA. We propose that variations in an individual’s immune response significantly determine susceptibility to CAPA. The aim of this paper is to deepen clinical understanding of CAPA’s pathogenesis, thereby aiding in mitigating susceptibility risk and advancing novel treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 virus induced COVID-19 pandemic has left survivors to frequently experience cognitive and neuropsychiatric problems such as “brain fog” which is one of many post-acute neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (Neuro-PASC), also referred to as long-COVID. It is unclear whether Neuro-PASC or the cognitive changes of long-term COVID are linked to increased risk for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Although mechanisms involved in the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system remains a challenge, studies have reported the presence of viral particles and viral RNA inside the brain. Our previous data suggest perivascular and vascular inclusions of Transactive response DNA/RNA binding protein-43 occur within astrocytes and endothelial cells in Alzheimer’s and COVID-19 human brain. In the present study, we tested whether SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and vascular phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) inclusions are associated with destabilized or disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB disruption is a feature of several age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, here we asked whether there are any mechanistic links between vascular and perivascular pTDP-43 inclusions and BBB tight junction disruption, which potentially parallel changes to BBB in AD? To test this, hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) from human AD brains (Braak IV-VI; CERAD definite) and cognitively normal age- and sex-matched controls, with and without comorbid COVID-19, were selected from autopsy cases conducted at Yale between 2014-2018 (non-COVID), and COVID-positive cases conducted between April 2020-2023; (n=10-12 per group). Immunofluorescence staining and Confocal imaging revealed differential and distinctive patterns of the three main tight junction proteins of BBB, Claudin-5, Occludin and Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1). Quantitative analysis revealed a highly significantly downregulated expression of Claudin-5 correlating with upregulated expression of GFAP and pTDP-43. The destabilization of the tight junction proteins on aberrant pTDP-43 inclusions suggests a potential breach in the blood-brain barrier and the activation of the paracellular route. The BBB breach is further confirmed by the presence of IgG molecules in the brain parenchyma and enhanced presence of IgG inside the microvessels of AD and COVID. Furthermore, a crucial finding is the increased transendothelial migration with the labeling of CD31 or Platelet endothelial cell adhesion protein PECAM-1 with pTDP-43 and the increased expression of endothelium specific fenestration marker protein, PLVAP compared to the Control. This implies protein leakage, barrier breakdown and loss of barrier integrity and increase in leukocyte trafficking, possibly intensifying inflammatory cascades. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of intensified phosphoTDP-43 microvasculopathy and compromised blood-brain barrier; via transcellular and paracellular pathways in SARS-CoV-2 and AD brain. Moreover this data provide evidence for SARS-CoV-2 fostering similar neuropathophysiological features found in Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a potential link between Long-COVID and development of AD.

        <tr id="Aimed to comprehensively investigate the presence of neural autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of COVID‐19 patients experiencing neurological complications during the Omicron wave in China. Forty consecutive COVID‐19 patients with severe neurological complications and 15 disease controls (DC) were enrolled. Neural autoantibodies were detected using both the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on mouse brain tissue and the Brain‐neuronal‐antigen microarray. Our results indicated a significantly higher prevalence of neural autoantibodies in the CSF (62.16% vs. 0.0%) and plasma (38.71% vs. 13.33%) of COVID‐19 patients compared to DC. Additionally, we identified 12 upregulated intrathecal IgG autoantibodies with differential levels between COVID‐19 patients and DC, as well as 51 upregulated IgG autoantibodies in plasma. A high prevalence of anti‐mGluR2 antibodies (13.33%) in COVID‐19 patients was confirmed by cell‐based assays. Western blot analysis showed these antibodies cross‐react with both the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2. Notably, strong binding to both the S protein's RBD‐Fc and mGluR2 was observed, an association that was substantiated by bioinformatics analysis evaluating the similarity between SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins and the targeted antigens on the microarray. This finding hints at a potential cross‐reactivity between anti‐mGluR2 antibodies and the S protein in COVID‐19 patients.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2's continued global health impact underscores the importance of ongoing pathogenesis research. Insights into the host's first line of defense against severe COVID-19 identify actionable biomarkers, informing disease management or therapeutics. Yet, the innate immune response, including cytokines, chemokines, adenosine deaminases (ADAs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), relevant to COVID-19 remain incompletely characterized.


METHODS
Peripheral blood was longitudinally collected between May 2020 and March 2021 from COVID-19 hospitalized adults (N=79) and healthy controls (HCs) (N=14; not tested, assumed COVID-negative, no viral exposure or symptoms). Heparinized blood was fractionated for plasma cryopreservation and in vitro whole blood TLR-stimulation employing TLR-3, -4, and -7/8 agonists. Post-stimulation culture supernatants were analyzed using multiplex and enzymatic assays.


RESULTS
Upon hospitalization, plasma concentrations of IFNγ, IL-6, CXCL10, and ADAs, were significantly upregulated compared to convalescent time points and HCs. Participants with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs concentrations upon admission. Plasma cytokines, chemokines, and ADAs positively correlated and associated with distinct temporal patterns. TLR-stimulated cell cultures from patients produced reduced IFNα2, IFNγ, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70 compared to HCs or later time points.


CONCLUSION
Higher plasma concentrations of IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs at admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Reduced TLR-mediated IFNα2, IFNγ, and IL-12p70 production suggests COVID dampens Th1-polarizing innate immune responses, providing insight into immunological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Complement overactivation, has been verified in COVID-19 patients. Complement regulatory proteins, including CD55, control complement overactivation thus eliminating complement deposition and cell lysis. We investigated complement regulatory protein expression in COVID-19 for potential deregulated expression patterns driving disease pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed increased PBMCs CD55 expression in severely and critically ill patients. This increase was also detected upon integrated subclustering analysis of monocyte, T cell and B cell populations. FACS analysis confirmed the significant upregulation of CD55 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and monocyte populations of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients. This upregulation was associated with decreased expression of type-I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, indicating a suppressor effect of CD55. Silencing of CD55 in T cells from COVID-19 severely ill patients in vitro and sensitization with SARS-CoV-2 peptides resulted in significantly augmented expression of ISGs and a reversal of their expression to levels similar to control or higher. The present study uncovers, to the best of our knowledge, a novel regulatory effect of CD55 on type-I IFN responses of severely ill COVID-19 patients, thus indicating its contribution to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and identifies a novel mechanistic pathway in the COVID-19 immune response.">

Furthermore, the diversity of macrophage subtypes, their spatial distribution, and distinct cellular functions are closely linked to the pathogenesis and severity of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, heart failure, and myocarditis. This association underscores the importance of investigating macrophage heterogeneity in different pathological contexts. Recent advances in multi-omics technologies—including single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and metabolomics—have elucidated the heterogeneity of macrophages, their intercellular interactions, underlying functional mechanisms, and spatial organization. In this review, we systematically summarize the diverse phenotypes and functional plasticity of macrophages in the regulation of cardiovascular diseases, with particular emphasis on the novel insights afforded by multi-omics approaches.

Investigating the altered pathogenicity of coexisting microorganisms and their influence on disease progression provides valuable insights for the development of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against infectious processes. This article provides a comprehensive review of current literature on viral-bacterial interactions in the context of respiratory infections, their pathogenic mechanisms, and significance during the COVID-19 pandemic. It synthesizes recent findings on how SARS-CoV-2 influences mucosal immunity, facilitates secondary bacterial infections through immune modulation, and impacts disease severity and clinical outcomes in co-infected individuals. Special attention is given to the molecular and cellular pathways mediating virus-bacteria interactions, including host receptor modulation, cytokine and interferon response alterations, and disruptions to the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiota. The epidemiological trends observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including shifts in the prevalence of common respiratory pathogens and the emergence of new co-infection patterns, are also considered. Understanding the dynamic interplay between viral and bacterial pathogens is crucial for optimizing patient management, improving outcomes, and guiding effective public health interventions.">

        <tr id="Introduction 1-5% of all patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), even those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, continue to have symptoms after initial recovery. Symptoms associated with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PACS) include, among others, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and cognitive dysfunction. Since the dysregulated immune response appears to be caused by the sustained activation of certain immune cells, including monocytes, and the release of specific cytokines, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PACS disease on monocyte subpopulations. Methods Twenty-two healthy and thirty-two patients with PACS were included into this study. We performed blood gas analysis and measured hematological parameters from peripheral blood of PACS patients and compared them with healthy donors. Surface markers to identify monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results PACS patients had higher numbers of intermediate and CD56+ monocytes, whereas the numbers of total monocytes, classical and non-classical monocytes were normal compared to healthy donors. Comparison of patients with and without fatigue, cough, and dyspnea showed no difference in monocyte subset frequencies. However, patients with cognitive dysfunction had increased numbers of non-classical monocytes compared to patients without this symptom. Discussion This suggests a disturbed homeostasis of the monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with PACS.">

Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we measured 1101 metabolites. The results revealed distinct metabolic profiles in acute COVID-19 and MIS-C patients, with significant alterations in lipid classes. Both conditions exhibited an elevated Apo-B100/Apo-A1 ratio and increased serum inflammatory markers. MIS-C patients showed unique disruptions, including increased triglycerides and altered lipoprotein composition. Despite milder clinical respiratory symptoms, children's metabolic disturbances mirrored those seen in severe adult COVID-19 patients, indicating a shared inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Neuroplasticity in the adult colon enables the enteric nervous system (ENS) to adaptively remodel in response to acute inflammation, preserving motility. However, chronic inflammation may drive maladaptive neuroplasticity, resulting in gastrointestinal dysmotility, a hallmark of functional gastrointestinal disorders, including Gulf War illness (GWI). GWI affects ∼30% of Gulf War veterans and has been linked to oral toxic exposures during combat, such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB). To explore mechanisms of persistent dysmotility, we developed a PB exposure model relevant to GWI. In the colon, we observed structural and functional ENS changes, including an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons and altered motility patterns. These were accompanied by a sustained influx of pro-inflammatory macrophages and elevated cytokine levels, indicating persistent low-grade enteric neuroinflammation. Inflammatory macrophages were found near enteric neural stem cells (ENSCs), impairing their regenerative potential. Transcriptomic analyses corroborated the presence of chronic neuroinflammation and dysregulated repair pathways. Together, our findings suggest that persistent enteric neuroinflammation and impaired neurogenesis contribute to long-term colonic dysmotility in GWI. This model offers new insights into chronic ENS dysfunction and may guide therapeutic strategies for GWI and related disorders.">

        <tr id="Cognitive dysfunction represents one of the most persistent and disabling features of Long COVID, yet its molecular underpinnings remain incompletely understood. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term neurocognitive sequelae. Key processes include persistent neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial dysfunction, immune dysregulation, and neuroendocrine imbalance. Microglial activation and cytokine release (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) promote synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury, while activation of inflammasomes such as NLRP3 amplifies CNS inflammation. Vascular abnormalities, including microthrombosis and BBB leakage, facilitate the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and neurotoxic mediators. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction and reduced vagal tone further exacerbate systemic inflammation and autonomic imbalance. Biomarkers such as GFAP, NFL, IL-6, and S100B have been associated with both neuroinflammation and cognitive symptoms. Notably, transcriptomic signatures in Long COVID overlap with those observed in Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting shared pathways involving tau dysregulation, oxidative stress, and glial reactivity. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for identifying at-risk individuals and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. This review underscores the need for longitudinal research and integrative biomarker analysis to elucidate the molecular trajectory of cognitive impairment in Long COVID.">

        <tr id="Background Monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in phagocytic reactions, which potentially play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Imbalance of these cells in peripheral blood has proven to affect not only innate but also adaptive immunity. It is possible that a search for strategies to restore monocyte activity could be a major step in achieving immune control over COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes and neutrophils, and COVID-19 severity, to assess the effects of a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent on phagocytosis parameters in in-hospital COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods The study included 105 adult patients with moderate COVID-19, who had been hospitalized in 2020–2021 and treated in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. All patients were divided into two groups: in Group 1 patients received standard treatment and Immunovac VP4 therapeutic vaccine, a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent as add-on therapy from Day 1 of hospitalization; in Group 2 patients did not receive any add-on treatment. The study parameters included C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), SpO2, lung involvement on chest computer tomography (CT) scan, and phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood leukocytes based on the absorption activity (AA) of monocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes against S. аureus). The parameters were assessed at 1, 14 and 30 days. Results Based on a cluster analysis of the clinical findings and the results of diagnostic tests obtained on admission, the patients were divided into 2 clusters: cluster 1 including patients with a more severe disease (n = 34) and cluster 2 including patients with a less severe disease (n = 71). Cluster 1 patients had higher levels of CRP (20.1 vs. 2.2 mg/mL, p < 0.001), AST (32.9 vs. 26.2 U/L, p = 0.003), lower SpO2 (94% vs. 96%, p < 0,001) and more extensive lung involvement on chest CT scan (35% vs. 12%, p < 0,001). There was a statistically significant direct correlation between blood monocyte AA and SpO2 (p = 0.04), an inverse correlation between monocyte AA and CRP (p = 0.003) and the extent of lung involvement on CT scan (p = 0.05). In less severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 2), no statistically significant correlation was observed. In more severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 1), there was a rise in monocyte AA on day 30 of hospitalization both in the control group (from 86.6 to 92.2, p = 0.03) and the main group, who received Immunovac VP4 add-on therapy (from 87.3 to 98.3, p = 0.05). However, the patients who received the immunostimulating agent, had higher monocyte PI than the controls, without the immunostimulant (p = 0.05). Patients from cluster 1 who were given Immunovac VP4 had higher SpO2 levels (98% vs. 97%, p = 0.01) than those who had received only the standard treatment. Discussion Blood monocyte AA correlates with COVID-19 severity: patients with less severe disease have higher AA and those with more severe illness have lower AA. The standard treatment, combined with Immunovac VP4 enhances phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes, which is associated with a more marked increase in SpO2, especially in more severe patients.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition linked to chronic neuroinflammation. This study investigates the cytokine gene expression profile in cortical tissue samples from elderly individuals with and without AD to identify potential biomarkers and enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Utilizing high-depth RNA sequencing data, we identified a set of cytokines whose expression significantly associated with different aspects of the AD phenotype, including measures of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-β deposition, and a person-specific rate of cognitive decline. Single-nucleus transcriptomics data facilitated the identification of specific cell types, such as microglia and oligodendrocytes, that significantly contribute to the inflammatory response in AD. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between the expression of certain cytokines and genetic risk for the disease. Our findings indicate that cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation plays a vital role in AD progression and that modulating the immune response may offer a promising strategy for developing new therapies.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world, but our understanding of causation is still lacking. A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD.This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation.Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections.Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.">

        <tr id="Background Acute lung injury (ALI), including its most severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a common cause of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Although its clinical characteristics have been well characterized, the relevant mechanism remains unclear. An imbalance in autophagy leads to alveolar remodeling and triggers the pathogenesis of ARDS. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of the STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine (Fluda) in ALI. C57BL6 mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and their lung tissues were analyzed via next-generation transcriptome sequencing. Results Western blotting revealed that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was highly expressed and STAT1 was phosphorylated following LPS exposure. Fluda significantly decreased the protein expression of STAT1/IRF1 and inhibited the alveolar infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. Nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release was decreased in the lungs of mice and RAW264.7 macrophages following Fluda treatment. In LPS-induced GFP-LC3 transgenic mice treated with Fluda, the counts of LC3-expressing neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid were significantly decreased. Furthermore, Fluda decreased LC3 and p62 protein expression, thereby inhibiting the release of NO, IL-6, and TNF-α in BAL. In RAW264.7 cells, the inhibition of STAT1/IRF1 by Fluda decreased LPS-induced ERK and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Conclusions The inhibition of STAT1/IRF1 by Fluda plays a pivotal role in modulating dysregulated autophagy by suppressing the MAPK and NF-κB p65 pathways in ALI.

        <tr id="The immune characteristics and pathological mechanisms of COVID‐19 and tuberculosis coinfection are not well understood. Single‐cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting complex immune responses and cellular interactions in infectious diseases. Here, we employed scRNA‐seq, combined with laboratory examinations and clinical observations, to elucidate potential mechanisms of immunopathology and protective immunity in coinfected patients. Substantial alterations in immune cell populations in patients with severe coinfection were observed, characterized by severe lymphopenia and massive expansion of myeloid cells. Lymphocytopenia may have resulted from lymphocyte apoptosis and migration. Systemic upregulation of S100 family proteins, mainly released by classical monocytes, might contribute to inflammatory cytokine storm via S100‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway in severely coinfected patients. Myeloid cells may contribute to immune paralysis in severe cases through expansion of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and dysregulated dendritic cell function. The immune landscape of T cells in severe patients were featured by dysregulated Th1 response, widespread exhaustion and increased cytotoxic, apoptosis, migration and inflammatory states. We observed increased plasma cells and overexpression of B‐cell‐activation‐related pathways in severe patients. Together, we provide a comprehensive atlas illustrating the immune response to coinfected patients at the single‐cell resolution and highlight mechanisms of pathogenesis in severe patients.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a major global health crisis with widespread effects on healthcare, society, and economies. Initially seen as a respiratory illness, it is now recognized as a multisystem disease, with growing evidence of its impact on the nervous system. 
Neurological complications - such as cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), strokes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and mood disorders - have been reported in both severe and mild COVID-19 cases, highlighting the unpredictable nature of post-COVID sequelae. These symptoms can persist long after the acute phase of infection. 
The mechanisms behind these effects are complex and not yet fully understood. They include direct viral invasion of the central nervous system, immune dysregulation (e.g., cytokine storm, autoimmunity), and blood–brain barrier disruption, all of which may lead to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. 
The long-term neurological consequences pose significant clinical and societal challenges, requiring multidisciplinary care and tailored rehabilitation strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches, aiming to inform evidence-based post-COVID care.">

        <tr id="Post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), i.e., long-lasting pathologies subsequent to infections that do not properly resolve, have both a common core and a broad diversity of manifestations. PAIS include a group of core symptoms (pathological fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disorders and pain) accompanied by a large set of diverse symptoms. Core and diverse additional symptoms, which can persist for years, exhibiting periods of relapses and remissions, usually start suddenly after an apparently common infection. PAIS display highly variable clinical features depending on the nature of the initial pathogen, and to an even larger extent, on the diversity of preexisting individual terrains in which PAIS are rooted. In a first part, I discuss biological issues related to the persistence of microbial antigens, dysregulated immune responses, reactivation of latent viruses, different potential self-sustained inflammatory loops, mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic disorders in the tryptophan- kynurenin pathway (TKP) with impact on serotonin, and consequences of a dysfunctional bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain axis. The second part deals with the nervous system dependence of PAIS. I rely on the concept of interoception, the process by which the brain senses, integrates and interprets signals originating from within the body, and sends feebacks aimed at maintaining homeostasis. Interoception is central for understanding the origin of fatigue, dysautonomia, dysfunctioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and its relation with stress, inflammation or depression. I propose that all individual predispositions leading to self-sustained vicious circles constitute building blocks that can self-assemble in many possible ways, to give rise to both core and diverse features of PAIS. A useful discrimination between different PAIS subtypes should be obtained with a composite profiling including biomarkers, questionnaires and functional tests so as to take into account PAIS multidimensionality.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis, highlighting the virus’s unique molecular mechanisms that distinguish it from other respiratory pathogens. It is known that the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α) activates a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways regulating cellular energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell survival, contributing to the wide range of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS). Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of HIF-1α is a key driver of systemic inflammation, silent hypoxia, and pathological tissue remodeling in both the acute and post-acute phases of the disease. This scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in INPLASY. It involved a literature search in Scopus and PubMed, supplemented by manual reference screening, with study selection facilitated by Rayyan software. Our analysis clarifies the dual role of HIF-1α, which may either worsen inflammatory responses and viral persistence or support adaptive mechanisms that reduce cellular damage. The potential for targeting HIF-1α therapeutically in COVID-19 is complex, requiring further investigation to clarify its precise role and translational applications. This review deepens the molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular and tissue dysfunction in hypoxia, offering insights for improving clinical management strategies and addressing long-term sequelae.">

        <tr id="The complement (C) pathway, a vital part of innate immunity, defends against pathogens and supports tissue surveillance. While local activation in the periphery enhances immune protection, dysregulation can trigger a self-amplifying cascade that spreads beyond the initial site, resulting in tissue injury. In the brain, complement proteins regulate synaptic plasticity and connectivity, raising the possibility that similar mechanisms of maladaptive propagation may disrupt neural circuits under pathological conditions. Although complement dysregulation is linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, the impact of localized upregulation in a small subset of cells on broader cortical networks remains unclear. To examine this, we overexpressed the schizophrenia (SCZ) risk gene C4 (C4-OE) in approximately 2% of prefrontal cortex neurons in mice using in utero electroporation. Bulk RNA sequencing of microdissected tissue revealed widespread transcriptional changes in a network predominantly comprising untransfected cells. C4-OE induced the upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, cytoprotection, and neurogenesis—suggesting a response consistent with compensatory remodeling or aberrant plasticity. Co-expression analysis identified a C4b-containing module enriched for dendritic development and cell cycle regulation, indicating alterations in circuit maturation. In contrast, immune and inflammatory genes were broadly downregulated, suggesting homeostatic suppression in response to sustained complement activity. Comparisons with human SCZ proteomic datasets revealed conserved gene signatures, highlighting the potential of our model to capture disease-relevant mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that sparse C4 overexpression can trigger widespread transcriptional changes across neural circuits, suggesting that local complement dysregulation may spread through cortical networks and drive broader functional disruption. Graphical Abstract Graphical Abstract: Sparse overexpression of complement C4 in prefrontal cortical neurons triggers widespread transcriptional changes across the network. Upregulated genes were associated with cholesterol biosynthesis, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and cytoprotective pathways, while immune and inflammatory genes were broadly downregulated, suggesting a compensatory response in neighboring, untransfected cells. These results indicate that localized complement dysregulation can alter transcriptional signatures across connected cortical circuits, potentially contributing to circuit-wide dysfunction initiated by focal immune activation.">

Beyond these foundational functions, ECs serve as key regulators of immune responses. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed that the cardiopulmonary vasculature is composed of diverse EC subpopulations, some of which exhibit specialized immunomodulatory properties. Evidence for immunomodulation includes distinct expression profiles associated with antigen presentation, cytokine secretion, immune cell recruitment, translocation, and clearance — functions critical for maintaining homeostasis in the heart and lungs. In cardiopulmonary diseases, ECs undergo substantial transcriptional reprogramming, leading to a shift from homeostasis to an activated state marked by heightened immunomodulatory activity. This transformation has highlighted the critical role for ECs in disease pathogenesis and their potential as future therapy targets. This Review emphasizes the diverse functions of ECs in the heart and lungs, particularly adaptive and maladaptive immunoregulatory roles in cardiopulmonary health and disease.">

This review elucidates the multifaceted impact of SARS-CoV-2 on diabetes mellitus, emphasizing the increased complexity of glycemic management in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection following viral infection in the postpandemic era. In this study, we examined the diverse effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on individuals with diabetes. These effects included an elevated risk of morbidity, erratic fluctuations in blood glucose levels, the emergence of complications associated with diabetes, and the emergence of challenges related to self-management of the disease. From a mechanistic perspective, we investigated the following factors: SARS-CoV-2-mediated direct damage to islet beta cells, dysregulation of the RAAS system, impairment of islet function by oxidative stress, and the effects of the integrated stress response, stress response, and reduced adiponectin levels on insulin utilization efficiency and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, viral effects extend to diabetic complications and cardiovascular risk factors, such as coagulation abnormalities, hypertension, and lipid metabolism. This results in an exacerbation of the development of diabetic complications. This review highlights the urgent need for refined management strategies for patients with diabetes during the pandemic and in the later stages of COVID-19. Additionally, there is a need for integrated management strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the long-term outcomes of patients with diabetes.">

We describe clinical symptoms, chemokine, cytokine, metabolomic and lipidomic derangements in a systemic mastocytosis patient following mRNA-1273 booster vaccination. Methods Twenty-eight chemokines and cytokines, 41 amino acids and 16 lipid classes were quantified with state-of-the-art methods. Results Mast cell activation (MCA) symptoms started 24 h after the mRNA-1273 booster vaccination with significant metabolic, lipidomic and cytokine derangements. Histamine concentrations peaked at life-threatening 18 ng/ml concomitant with high tryptase. Peak plasma IL-1Ra, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, CXCL10 and GM-CSF concentrations were elevated 54-, 4.9-, 85-, 54-, 6.1-, 19- and 6.4-fold respectively. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, was administered 6 h after admission, because of the highly elevated IL-6 concentrations. More than one year later IL-6 was highly elevated during another MCA attack likely caused by a PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and tocilizumab was again used. Clinical symptoms improved during the following 12 h similar to the vaccine booster MCA attack. Conclusions A mRNA-1273 first booster vaccination likely caused a delayed severe MCA attack with highly elevated Th2-biased cytokines with metabolic and lipidomic derangements. Administration of an IL-6 receptor blocker during both MCA attacks might have shortened the duration of clinical symptoms.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revealed the phenotypic and functional diversity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), identifying specific populations that directly impact the antitumor response. However, despite the recognition of TAMs as promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment, research is hindered by the lack of validated human preclinical models. Here, we applied scRNA-seq to a 3D human cell-based model comprising tumor cell line-derived spheroids, cancer-associated fibroblasts and primary monocytes, a setup widely used in immuno-oncology research. Integration of our in vitro data with publicly available patient-derived datasets showed that the macrophages in this model share phenotypic characteristics with the pro-angiogenic and pro-fibrotic SPP1+ TAM population recently found across multiple cancer types and inflammatory lung diseases. This population was linked to aspects of disease progression and associated with poor prognosis in several tumor indications, highlighting the need for relevant models enabling its study as an immunotherapy target. Our research validates the use of a 3D human cell-based culture as a more in vivo-relevant model and enables the preclinical testing of novel macrophage-targeting drugs in a human disease-relevant setup.">

        <tr id="Purpose of review The immunological processes that lead to multiple sclerosis (MS) and occur during the progressive phase of the disease are manifold and still not well understood. This review summarizes new insights on this topic that were gained through recent studies with diverse scientific approaches. Recent findings While genetic risk clearly contributes to MS, external factors play a key role in its pathogenesis as well. Epstein-Barr virus infection correlates significantly with MS risk and seems to be a major causal factor. Even though our knowledge on the human gut microbiome and its connection to the central nervous system is far from being complete, several studies have proven that the gut–brain axis influences neuroinflammation and disease progression in MS. It has become much clearer that MS is not solely a T cell-mediated disease but is also strongly driven by B cells and pathogenic antibodies. Beyond the peripheral immune cells, glial cells and their interactions with neurons are important players contributing to disease activity and progression in MS. Summary Taken together, recent publications on immunological processes in the context of MS implicate a multitude of noncanonical mechanisms that need to be further explored regarding their interplay and contribution to the degenerative course of the disease.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease damaging the central nervous system. Diminished inflammatory disease activity (DA) as people with MS (pwMS) age motivated randomized clinical trials assessing disease-modifying therapy (DMT) discontinuation in older pwMS given the concern for risks outweighing benefits. This study aims to examine whether peripheral production of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)-driven cytokine responses mediate the aging-associated decline in MS inflammatory DA. Methods We included the clinical data of 669 adult pwMS between 2017 and 2022 who enrolled in a clinic-based prospective cohort. From a subset of 80 participants, we isolated fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cultured with 50 µg/ml of MBP (or heat-killed Candida) for 24 h. We assayed cell culture supernatants for interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and a subset of the supernatant samples using a commercial human cytokine/chemokine array. We examined the associations between age and annualized relapse rate (ARR) as well as between age and MBP-stimulated cytokine production (by cultured PBMC) using covariate-adjusted linear regressions. We performed mediation analyses to determine the extent to which MBP-driven cytokine response drives the association between age and ARR. Results Among 669 pwMS (mean age 51.7 ± 12.7 years, 80.7% women, 89.4% non-Hispanic White), ARR declined with age (β=-0.003, p < 0.001). Among the subgroup of 80 pwMS whose cultured PBMCs underwent ex vivo MBP stimulation, IL-17 production declined with age in women (β=-0.27, p = 0.04) but not men (β=-0.1, p = 0.73). MBP-driven IL-17 response partially mediated the association between older age and lower ARR (24.6% in women, 15.3% in men). In exploratory analyses, older pwMS (≥ 50 years) had marginally lower (IL-4, MCP-2, MCP-3, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB) and higher (Fractalkine, MDC) concentrations of several cytokines than younger pwMS (< 50 years), while certain cytokines (MCP-2, MDC) mediated whereas others negated the effect of age on ARR. Conclusion Diminished peripheral IL-17 response as a potential biological mechanism underlying the aging-dependent decline in MS inflammatory DA warrants further investigation.

        <tr id="Leigh syndrome (LS) is the most common pediatric presentation of genetic mitochondrial disease and characterized by neurological and metabolic abnormalities. The hallmark of the disease is the presence of progressive, bilateral, symmetric neurodegenerative lesions in the brainstem and/or basal ganglia. Recent studies in the Ndufs4(-/-) mouse model of LS indicate that disease is causally driven by the immune system. Both microglia and peripherally originating macrophages are enriched in the lesions of Ndufs4(-/-) mice and pharmacologic elimination of these cell types prevents disease indicating a crucial role for innate immune cells. Here, we investigated the role of the adaptive immune system in Ndufs4(-/-) disease pathogenesis. We crossed Ndufs4(-/-) mice with mice expressing a null form of interleukin 2 receptor gamma (Il2rg) and monitored disease onset and progression. Il2rg knockout (KO) mice have dramatically depleted numbers of B-, T-, the adaptive immune system’s key cellular actors, and NK-cells. We observed no difference in neurological disease progression or overall survival between Ndufs4(-/-)/Il2rg(WT) and Ndufs4(-/-)/Il2rg(KO) mice, strongly suggesting that T cells, B cells, and NK cells do not play a significant role in CNS disease pathogenesis in Ndufs4(-/-) mice. Combined with previous studies indicating a causal role for macrophages, we conclude that LS CNS pathology is primarily driven by the monocyte/macrophage innate immune system.">

        <tr id="We recently developed an original HCV-permissive cell culture model based on both partial differentiation and physiological oxygen pressure (Hypo-Diff cells) that produces highly infectious lipid-rich and native-like HCV-lipoviroparticles (LVPs). Here, we explored the precise role of physiological hypoxia and related specific transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and 2α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) to better understand the mechanism governing viral morphogenesis. Knocking-down HIF-2α specifically reduced both the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets in Huh7.5 Hypo-Diff cells, suggesting a central role for HIF-2 in controlling lipid metabolism under physiological hypoxia. In HCV-infected siHIF-2α Hypo-Diff cells, both HCV replication and the specific infectious viral efficacy of progeny viruses were significantly impaired. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of a mutated form of the HIF-2α protein, stabilized in normoxia, both increased the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets and restored the production of highly infectious HCV viruses in the absence of cell differentiation. Finally, by iodixanol fractionation of supernatants to determine the mean buoyant density of infectious HCV LVPs, we established that HIF-2α is exclusively responsible for producing highly lipidated and broadly infectious HCV-LVPs by Hypo-Diff cells. These findings thus clearly establish the central role of physiological hypoxia, and notably HIF-2, in the production of highly infectious lipid-rich native-like HCV particles. Since physiological hypoxia is a shared characteristic in mammalian tissues, we propose to reconsider the role of natural oxygen tension and especially the role of HIF-2 in the life cycle of other lipid-associated viruses, whether hepatotropic or not.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that caused by SARS-CoV-2. It affects multiple systems, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are known to be susceptible to COVID-19. Surprisingly, there is a certain correlation and similarity between these two diseases to some extent. In this study, we performed a systematic review of relevant studies published on PubMed from December 2019 to January 2023 from the aspects of the clinical features of SLE patients with COVID-19, the immunological similarities between COVID-19 and SLE, the prevention and therapeutic approach of SLE patients with COVID-19, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SLE patients. Our findings indicate that SLE patients at higher risk of COVID-19 infection than the general population, and SLE patients treated with glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants have a higher rate of hospitalization. Consequently, the use of immunosuppressants during COVID-19 infection in SLE patients is of concern and additional treatment approaches should be explored. Moreover, SLE patients with COVID-19 also face challenges in accessing healthcare, financial hardship, and psychological distress. These issues require further attention and can be addressed by providing telemedicine, ensuring adequate supplies of medicines and promoting psychological well-beings. Together, this article summarizes the correlation and similarity between SLE and COVID-19, and provides a detailed and practical guide for the prevention, treatment and nursing of SLE patients with COVID-19. Moreover, this article also discusses the fields that require further research and provide reference for the management of other autoimmune diseases in the case of viral infection.">

        <tr id="To date, murine sepsis models have failed to recapitulate human acute respiratory distress syndrome, one of the leading complications of human sepsis. We set out to determine if preexisting T cell memory, which is common in human adults and lacking in laboratory mice, could contribute to lung inflammation in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis. After administering an anti-CD3ε activating antibody to C57Bl/6 mice to induce a T cell memory repertoire, we compared the pulmonary immune response to CLP in these “Immune-Educated mice” to responses observed in Uneducated control animals. Compared to Uneducated mice, 24 hours after CLP, Immune-Educated mice had higher alveolar inflammatory cytokine and chemokine concentrations and more pulmonary interstitial macrophages. After 48 hours, the proportion of effector CD4 T cells that produced interferon-gamma was greater in Immune- Educated mice. After 72 hours, there were more alveolar macrophages in the lungs of Educated mice. Separately, we performed adoptive transfer of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells from immunized C57Bl/6J to B6.SJL mice and IFNγ blockade at the time of CLP. Interstitial macrophage recruitment 24 hours post-CLP was more pronounced in mice undergoing adoptive transfer of memory T cells compared to mice that did not undergo adoptive transfer. IFNγ blockade resulted in higher absolute numbers of T cells, memory T cells, and innate cells in the lungs of Educated mice 24 hours post-CLP suggesting that IFNγ is necessary for curbing an overactive immune response in these mice. In conclusion, the presence of memory T cells affects the course of CLP- induced lung inflammation and may provide a model that more closely resembles sepsis- associated lung injury. Summary Statement Prior immune memory alters the course of CLP-induced lung inflammation in mice.">

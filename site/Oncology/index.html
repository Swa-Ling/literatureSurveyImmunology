        <tr id="The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has threatened human health worldwide. Among protective immune reactions, T cell responses are diverse among individuals, which is related to the differences in severity. A T cell subset, regulatory T (Treg) cells, is crucial for limiting excessive immune responses. If SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs are developed during infection, they may counteract anti-viral immunity and cause severe symptom. To address this possibility, we conducted single-cell TCR-RNA-sequencing of PBMCs from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Among thirteen donors, one with severe symptom had substantially more FOXP3-expressing Treg clonotypes activated in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virion or other major antigen proteins. To define the reactivity of these Treg clonotypes, fifteen highly expanded Treg clonotypes were reconstituted into reporter cells and stimulated with 27 distinct peptide pools that cover all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However, none of these clonotypes react to any SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Instead, the reporter cells expressing one TCR clonotype (23599) were activated in the presence of EBV-transformed B cells without adding exogenous antigens. Furthermore, 23599 TCR-expressing cells were activated by non-transformed naïve syngenic B cells in DQA1*03:03-DQB1*04:01-dependent manner, suggesting that clonotype 23599 may be autoreactive. This Treg clonotype, 23599, was also detected in a public TCR database, and significantly expanded in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not the dominant antigen inducing Treg during infection.">

        <tr id="Severity of COVID-19 is affected by multiple factors; however, it is not understood how the inflammatory milieu of the lung at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure affects the control of viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that immune events in the mouse lung closely preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection affect viral control and identify innate immune pathways that limit viral replication. Pulmonary inflammatory stimuli including resolved, antecedent respiratory infections with Staphylococcus aureus or influenza, ongoing pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, ovalbumin/alum-induced asthma, or airway administration of TLR ligands and recombinant cytokines all establish an antiviral state in the lung that restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to antiviral type I interferons, TNFα and IL-1 potently precondition the lung for enhanced viral control. Our work shows that SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from an immunologically quiescent lung microenvironment and suggests that heterogeneity in pulmonary inflammation preceding SARS-CoV-2 exposure may contribute to variability in disease outcomes.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has been the most severe public health emergency since 2019. Currently, the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the most dominant. The most prominent symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory. Meanwhile, the fatality of COVID-19 was mainly from pneumonia. However ,in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have pneumonia and those who do not, the differences in the immune repertoire still require further investigation. Methods We conducted seven-chain adaptome immune repertoire analyses on patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, both with and without pulmonary infiltration. Results Patients with pulmonary infiltration exhibit lymphopenia, a decreased proportion of the overall TCR repertoire alongside an increased BCR repertoire, reduced IGHD and IGHM isotype expression, a shorter mean CDR3 length for TRG, and a longer mean length for TRD, as well as diminished clonality and diversity in the TCR/BCR repertoire. Meanwhile, patients with pulmonary infiltration have distinct V-J gene usage and unique CDR3 signature, as well as BCR class switch recombination pattern. Finally, prior vaccination triggered less BCR IGHM/IGHD somatic hypermutation response, preserved the diversity of the entire adaptive immune repertoire, and provided clinical protection against severe or critical conditions following Omicron infection. Discussion We report a unique, comprehensive adaptive immune system signature in patients with pulmonary infiltration, which may serve as potential immunological biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Current understanding of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and host responses driving the pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate gene expression patterns during acute SARS-CoV-2 illness. Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples. We also generated expression data on the human nose organoid model during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The human nose organoid-generated host transcriptional response captured many aspects of responses observed in the above patient samples, while suggesting the existence of distinct host responses to SARS-CoV-2 depending on the cellular context, involving both epithelial and cellular immune responses. Our findings provide a catalog of SARS-CoV-2 host response genes changing over time and magnitude of these host responses were significantly correlated to viral load.">

        <tr id="Few pathogens have historically been subjected to as intense scientific and clinical scrutiny as SARS-CoV-2. The genetic, immunological, and environmental factors influencing disease severity and post-infection clinical outcomes, known as correlates of immunity, remain largely undefined. Clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to those with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms. While most infected individuals return to their former health and fitness within a few weeks, some develop debilitating chronic symptoms, referred to as long-COVID. Autoimmune responses have been proposed as one of the factors influencing long-COVID and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between viral infections and autoimmune pathologies is not new. Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, among others, have been shown to induce the production of autoantibodies and the onset of autoimmune conditions. Given the extensive literature on SARS-CoV-2, here we review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmune pathologies, with a focus on autoantibodies. We closely examine mechanisms driving autoantibody production, particularly their connection with disease severity and long-COVID.">

Coronavirus interactions with host innate immune antiviral responses are an important determinant of disease outcome. This review compares the host's innate response to different human coronaviruses. Host antiviral defenses discussed in this review include frontline defenses against respiratory viruses in the nasal epithelium, early sensing of viral infection by innate immune effectors, double-stranded RNA and stress-induced antiviral pathways, and viral antagonism of innate immune responses conferred by conserved coronavirus nonstructural proteins and genus-specific accessory proteins. The common cold coronaviruses HCoV-229E and -NL63 induce robust interferon signaling and related innate immune pathways, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 induce intermediate levels of activation, and MERS-CoV shuts down these pathways almost completely.">

        <tr id="An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in over 7 million confirmed deaths. In addition to severe respiratory and systematic symptoms, several comorbidities increase the risk of fatal outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing conditions in patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. Recent clinical studies have reported the reactivation of human herpesviruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), in severe COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. To support these clinical observations, we established a KSHV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection system in A549-hACE2 cells. Our findings indicate that co-infection with live SARS-CoV-2 sharply induces KSHV lytic reactivation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in global cellular gene expression in KSHV-infected A549-hACE2 cells, both with and without SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. These data provide a molecular basis for understanding whether patients with pre-existing oncogenic herpesvirus infections are at increased risk for more severe COVID-19 or for developing virus-associated cancers even after full recovery from COVID-19.">

However, there is a lack of research concerning the molecular mechanisms related to immune responses and metabolism induced by these variants. Methods Here, metabolomics combined with transcriptomics was performed to elucidate the immunometabolic changes in the lung of hamsters infected with delta and omicron variants. Results Both variants caused acute inflammation and lung pathology in intranasally infected hamsters. Principal component analysis uncovered the delta variant significantly altered lung metabolite levels between the pre- and post-infection states. Additionally, metabolic pathways determined by assessment of metabolites and genes in lung revealed significant alterations in arginine biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism upon infection with both variants and closely linked to inflammatory cytokines, indicating immune activation and oxidative stress in response to both variants. These metabolic changes were also evident in the serum, validating the presence of systemic alterations corresponding to those identified in lung. Notably, the delta variant induced a more robust metabolic regulation than the omicron variant. Discussion The study suggests that multi-omics is a valuable approach for understanding immunometabolic responses to infectious diseases, and providing insights for effective treatment strategies.">

While advancement of vaccines and drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 virus has reduced severe illness, reinfection remains a significant concern. This paper explores the impact of COVID-19 reinfection on human immunity and examines possible coping strategies, particularly the advancements in plant-derived adjuvants to enhance vaccine efficacy. The virus's ability to mutate, evade immune responses, and affect immune memory highlights the importance and potential effectiveness of treatments that prolong immunity response. Plant-derived adjuvants Advax and Matrix-M have been shown to improve long term immune responses by stimulating long-lasting antibodies and cytotoxic T-cell activation. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy and safety in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19, along plant-based adjuvants reducing reinfection risks. Future research could further focus on develop precising adjuvants’ formulations, exploring more plant-based compounds that could be apply in vaccine development, and conducting long-term studies to evaluate long-term immune durability and safety of the vaccines.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to numerous cases of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), worldwide. This co-infection has increased patient mortality due to the lack of efficient bi-targeted drugs. Cambogin, a bioactive natural product, has been shown to effectively induce regression of KSHV-latently infected tumours in xenograft mice models; however, its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Here, we report that Cambogin targets 46 host genes commonly affected by both SARS-CoV-2 and KSHV infections, as identified through bioinformatics analysis. These genes are related with 14 key upstream signalling pathways, particularly those involved in inflammation regulation, protein phosphorylation, metabolic processes, and cellular stress response. Within the transcriptional factor (TF)-miRNA co-regulatory network, ten out of 46 hub-target genes are closely linked to Cambogin and KSHV/SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, Cambogin not only efficiently blocks the replication and virion production of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo by reducing the expression of EGFR and Cyclin A2, but also simultaneously inhibits both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the growth of KSHV-induced tumours in vivo using a murine xenograft model. These findings provide an alternative strategy for the potential use of Cambogin in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients, particularly those with KSHV co-infection.">

This review investigates the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2's interaction with cardiac tissue, particularly emphasizing the role of the Spike protein and ACE2 receptor in facilitating viral entry and subsequent cardiac complications. We dissect the structural features of the virus, its interactions with host cell receptors, and the resulting pathophysiological changes in the heart. Highlighting SARS-CoV-2's broad organ tropism, especially its effects on cardiomyocytes via ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the review addresses how these interactions exacerbate cardiovascular issues in patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Additionally, we assess both direct and indirect mechanisms of virus-induced cardiac damage, including myocarditis, arrhythmias, and long-term complications such as 'long COVID'. This review underscores the complexity of SARS-CoV-2's impact on the heart, emphasizing the need for ongoing research to fully understand its long-term effects on cardiovascular health.

        <tr id="Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

Understanding the mechanisms of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for addressing COVID-19–related liver pathology and developing targeted therapies. This editorial discusses the significance of ACE2 in hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, drawing on the research by Jacobs et al .

        <tr id="Understanding the early interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human airway epithelial cells is essential for unraveling viral replication and spread mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the early dynamics of airway epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection using well-differentiated human nasal and tracheal epithelial cell cultures by incorporating three publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We identified a previously uncharacterized cell population, termed virus-rich intermediate (VRI) cells, representing an intermediate differentiation stage between basal and ciliated cells. These VRI cells exhibited high viral loads at all infection time points, strong interferon and inflammatory responses, increased mRNA expression of microvilli-related genes (PAK1, PAK4, VIL1), and suppression of apoptosis markers (BAX, CASP3) alongside increased anti-apoptotic gene expression (BCL2). Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that VRI cells send signals to basal cells via receptor-ligand pathways such as EPHA and VEGF, likely promoting basal cell differentiation and proliferation through MAPK signaling. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes VRI cells as a primary site for replication and spread, leveraging these cells’ unique differentiation state to evade host cell death and facilitate viral propagation. This study provides insights into the early cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights potential therapeutic targets to limit viral spread.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the worst pandemics in human history. The causative virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can invade host cells in multiple organs by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II expressed on the cell surface. Once inside the host cell, viral replication takes place, leading to cellular disruption and the release of signal molecules that are recognised by the innate immune system. Innate immunity activation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and primes the adaptive immune system. The proinflammatory environment defends against further viral entry and replication. SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to lead to myocardial injury through several mechanisms. Firstly, direct viral-mediated cellular invasion of cardiomyocytes has been shown in in vitro and histological studies, which is related to cellular injury. Secondly, the proinflammatory state during COVID-19 can lead to myocardial injury and the release of protein remnants of the cardiac contractile machinery. Thirdly, the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is associated with thromboembolism of coronary arteries and/or other vascular systems. COVID-19 patients can also develop heart failure; however, the underlying mechanism is much less well-characterised than for myocardial injury. Several questions remain regarding COVID-19-related heart failure, including its potential reversibility, the role of anti-viral medications in its prevention, and the mechanisms underlying heart failure pathogenesis in long COVID-19. Further work is required to improve our understanding of the mechanism of cardiac sequelae in COVID-19, which may enable us to target SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients against longer-lasting cardiovascular complications.">

VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the respiratory system and other organ systems. Tissue injuries resulting from viral infection and host hyperinflammatory responses may lead to moderate to severe pneumonia, systemic complications, and even death. While anti-inflammatory agents have been used to treat patients with severe COVID-19, their therapeutic effects are limited. GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) is a pro-inflammatory receptor expressed on vascular endothelial cells, regulating leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a GPR4 antagonist, NE-52-QQ57, in the SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Our results demonstrated that GPR4 antagonist treatment increased the survival rate in this severe COVID-19 mouse model. The inflammatory response, characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was reduced in the GPR4 antagonist group compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, both SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and infectious viral titers in the mouse lung were decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive mouse brains was also decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, the GPR4 antagonist inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero E6 cells. Together, these results suggest that GPR4 antagonism may be explored as a novel approach for the treatment of COVID-19 and other similar viral diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has profoundly impacted global health, with pneumonia emerging as a major complication in severe cases. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is marked by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an excessive inflammatory response, resulting in oxidative stress and significant tissue damage, particularly in the respiratory system. Antioxidants have garnered considerable attention for their potential role in managing COVID-19 pneumonia by mitigating oxidative stress and modulating immune responses. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the use of antioxidants in hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Studies exploring antioxidants, including vitamins, trace elements, nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O3), glutathione (GSH), L-carnitine, melatonin, bromelain, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and numerous polyphenols, have yielded promising outcomes. Through their ROS-scavenging properties, these molecules support endothelial function, reduce the thrombosis risk, and may help mitigate the effects of the cytokine storm, a key contributor to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Clinical evidence suggests that antioxidant supplementation may improve patient outcomes by decreasing inflammation, supporting immune cell function, and potentially shortening recovery times. Furthermore, these molecules may mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19 by exerting direct antiviral effects that inhibit the infection process and genomic replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. Moreover, antioxidants may work synergistically with standard antiviral treatments to reduce viral-induced oxidative damage. By integrating findings from the literature with real-world data from our clinical experience, we gain a more profound understanding of the role of antioxidants in managing COVID-19 pneumonia. Further research combining comprehensive literature reviews with real-world data analysis is crucial to validate the efficacy of antioxidants and establish evidence-based guidelines for their use in clinical practice.">

In turn, the metabolic status shapes the diverse ILC2 phenotypes and effector functions. Hence, deciphering the metabolic networks of ILC2s is essential in understanding ILC2’s roles in health as well as pathophysiologies.

Beyond its primary respiratory impact, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in various extra-pulmonary complications. Research studies reveal that the virus affects multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system (CNS), largely due to the widespread expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. Clinical evidence shows that the virus can induce diabetes by disrupting pancreatic and liver functions as well as cause acute kidney injury.

 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a dynamic evolution of the immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), initially characterized by primary responses and later by secondary responses due to mass vaccination and viral variants. Understanding the interplay between humoral (antibody) and cellular (T-cell) immunity is crucial for effective public health strategies. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between T-cell responses and antibody levels in a sample of the adult Albanian population during the transition of COVID-19 from a pandemic to an endemic phase. The rationale for this investigation is to generate data that can inform the ongoing management of COVID-19, particularly in the context of vaccination and immunity monitoring, to ensure that public health strategies remain effective as the virus becomes more permanent in the population.



 This cross-sectional observational study involved individuals over 18 years of age who were randomly selected at intervals of every 20 records from the family doctor registries of five urban health centers in Tirana and Berat, Albania, between January 23 and April 3, 2023. Participants provided demographic and health data, including vaccination and infection history. Blood samples were analyzed for cellular immunity using an Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assay and for humoral immunity using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure anti-spike (S1) and anti-nucleoprotein (N) IgG antibodies. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between levels of IFN-γ, anti-S1, and anti-N IgG antibodies and factors such as vaccination status, prior COVID-19 infections, and reinfection rates. These analyses employed bivariate and multivariate approaches, including Fisher’s exact test, the Mann–Whitney U test, the Kruskal–Wallis test, linear and multiple regression analyses, and Spearman’s correlation coefficient test.



 The study involved 164 individuals (54.7% female, median age 43 years). Of these individuals, 62.8% (103/164) were vaccinated, primarily with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. IFN-γ positivity was detected in 95.1% (156/164), and anti-S1 IgG positivity in 93.3% (153/164). Significant correlations were observed between IFN-γ and anti-S1 IgG levels (r = 0.502; P < 0.001). Vaccinated individuals exhibited significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and anti-S1 IgG than unvaccinated individuals (P < 0.05). Reinfections were more prevalent in unvaccinated individuals than vaccinated individuals (26.2% [16/61] vs. 12.6% [13/103], P = 0.034). According to multiple regression analysis, the levels of anti-S1 antibodies were significantly correlated with protection against reinfection (regression coefficient β = –0.003; P = 0.042), while IFN-γ levels did not exhibit such a correlation (regression coefficient β = –1.659; P = 0.146).



 Vaccination, especially when combined with previous infection, significantly boosts both cellular and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The close correlation between IFN-γ and anti-S1 IgG levels indicates that vaccinated individuals mount a robust immune response. The lower reinfection rates among vaccinated individuals highlight the importance of vaccination for sustained protection. Assessing anti-S1 IgG antibodies and IFN-γ levels could be particularly beneficial for immunocompromised individuals when making decisions about revaccination. This study highlights the critical role of comprehensive immune monitoring in the management of COVID-19 and offers insights for future vaccination strategies.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with neurological effects that persist beyond the acute phase, collectively referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or “long COVID.” This article discusses the neurological impacts of PASC, which can occur regardless of the initial illness’s severity. Studies indicate that most patients continue to experience symptoms for at least 3 months post-infection. Long-term effects include neurocognitive deficits, sleep disturbances, and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. Proposed mechanisms underlying these effects include neuroinflammation, microvascular damage, and autoimmune responses, while direct viral neuroinvasion remains a topic of ongoing debate. SARS-CoV-2 may also worsen pre-existing neurological disorders and increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease. The article highlights the need for longitudinal studies to better understand the variability in outcomes and the mechanisms driving these persistent effects. In addition, it explores the inflammatory pathways linking long COVID to AD. Both conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation, activation of shared markers such as the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome, and alterations in amyloid-beta production. The apolipoprotein E4 gene, a known risk factor for AD, is also associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes.

 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. However, SARS-CoV-2 chiefly infects lungs through the binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) expressed on the alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, the intestinal epithelial cells also express ACE2 receptors. Not only has the SARS-CoV-2 been detected in nasopharyngeal and mid-nasal samples, but also it seems SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found in the feces of infectious patients. In fact, fecal samples of patients contain RNA of the virus. The intensity of COVID-19 has mainly been associated with aging and comorbidities. Older patients experience a decline in the alteration of the gut microbiome, and COVID-19 has proven to be most fatal in this age group, further emphasizing the potential critical role of gut microbiota in this disease. The lung was formerly believed to be a sterile area free from bacteria. However, the lung microbiome has received more attention due to its recent link to several respiratory illnesses and immunity. In this review article, data from COVID-19 research and gut–lung cross-talk in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease and explored the bidirectional impacts of it on the gut–lung axis microbiome were discussed.

        <tr id="Diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) represent two public health emergencies. In severe disease, both pathogens may share a biological niche in the lower respiratory tract. There is significant potential for SARS-CoV-2 and M.tb infections to be co-present within individuals and enhance or moderate the respective outcomes of either infection. Here, we investigated how whole blood samples, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, from individuals hospitalised with acute COVID-19 disease respond to mycobacterial challenge. To do this, samples were assessed by ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assays, immune cell phenotyping by mass cytometry, and whole blood cytokine responses to mycobacterial antigens assessed by flow cytometry. These studies identified a subgroup of COVID-19 patients whose blood had an enhanced capacity to inhibit mycobacterial growth. The ability to control mycobacterial growth was associated with the presence of a non M.tb-specific CD28+ CD8+ T cell population, with a particular activation status and migratory phenotype. This work improves our understanding of factors involved in mycobacterial control, and may contribute to the design of novel therapies for TB.">

        <tr id="Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus persists in multiple organs due to its tropism for various tissues, including the skeletal system. This study investigates the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including both ancestral and Omicron viral strains, on differentiating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the precursor cells, into osteoblasts. Although both viral strains can productively infect osteoblasts, precursor cell infection remained abortive. Viral exposure during osteoblast differentiation demonstrates that both variants inhibit mineral and organic matrix deposition. This is accompanied by reduced expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the upregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) strongly suggests that the ancestral and Omicron variants may disrupt bone homeostasis by promoting osteoclast differentiation, ultimately leading to the formation of bone-resorbing cells. This process is dependent of spike glycoprotein since its neutralization significantly reduced the effect of infective SARS-CoV-2 and UV-C inactivated virus. This study underscores the capacity of ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants to disrupt osteoblast differentiation, a process essential for preserving the homeostasis and functionality of bone tissue.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has challenged the scientific and medical community since its emergence. Understanding the immunopathogenic events that occur during infection is crucial to developing effective treatment and prevention strategies.Objective: To synthesize the immunological aspects in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019.Development: SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the entry of the virus into host cells through the ACE2 receptor. Once inside, the virus induces an immune response. In the early stages, the innate immune response is activated, which includes the release of interferons and cytokines. However, in some patients, this response becomes deregulated, triggering a cytokine storm that contributes to systemic inflammation and lung damage. T and B cells also play a crucial role; although the activation of CD8+ T cells can help control the infection, their depletion in severe cases has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Immunopathogenic events in COVID-19 are complex and can lead to diverse clinical outcomes. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for the development of targeted therapies and effective vaccines. Continued research is critical to improving our response to future pandemics.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The global pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 has resulted in millions of people experiencing long COVID condition, a range of persistent symptoms following the acute phase, with an estimated prevalence of 27%–64%. Materials and Methods To understand its pathophysiology, we conducted a longitudinal study on viral load and cytokine dynamics in individuals with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We used reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR to quantify viral RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and employed multiplex technology to measure plasma cytokine levels in a cohort of people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Our study included individuals with long COVID condition and those without, all of whom had at least three nasopharyngeal and plasma samples collected within 55 days after diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results Individuals affected with long COVID symptoms had delayed viral clearance and lower viral loads at diagnosis compared to those without symptoms. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed variations in IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10 levels, with delayed normalization in individuals affected by long COVID syndrome. Correlation analysis indicated associations between viral load and IP‐10 and interrelations among cytokines IL‐1β, IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10. Conclusion Our study provides insights into the association between nasopharyngeal viral load, cytokine dynamics, and the development of long COVID syndrome, providing an early signature of this condition.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 and other pandemic viruses continue being important for public health and the global economy. Therefore, it is essential to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19 more deeply, particularly its association with inflammatory and antiviral processes. In this study, we used the RNA-seq technique to analyze mRNA and non-coding RNA profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals after SARS-CoV-2 in vitro exposure, to identify pathways related to immune response and the regulatory post-transcriptional mechanisms triggered that can serve as possible complementary therapeutic targets. Our analyses show that SARS-CoV-2 induced a significant regulation in the expression of 790 genes in PBMCs, of which 733 correspond to mRNAs and 57 to non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The immune response, antiviral response, signaling, cell proliferation and metabolism are the main biological processes involved. Among these, the inflammatory response groups the majority of regulated genes with an increase in the expression of chemokines involved in the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and T-cells. Additionally, it was observed that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 induces the expression of genes related to the IL-27 pathway but not of IFN-I or IFN-III, indicating the induction of ISGs through this pathway rather than the IFN genes. Moreover, several lncRNA and RNA binding proteins that can act in the cis-regulation of genes of the IL-27 pathway were identified. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can regulate the expression of multiple genes in PBMCs, mainly related to the inflammatory and antiviral response. Among these, lncRNAs establish an important mechanism in regulating the immune response to the virus. They could contribute to developing severe forms of COVID-19, constituting a possible therapeutic target.">

The lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced focal demyelination model enables investigations into the mechanisms of remyelination, providing insight into the molecular basis underlying an evolving remyelinating microenvironment over a tractable time course. Here, we present a detailed analysis using high-resolution single nucleus RNA sequencing to investigate gene expression dynamics across multiple cell populations involved in the remyelination process. We examine three specific time points following focal demyelinating injury in mice, and by delineating activation states within the heterogeneous cell populations of demyelinated lesions, we highlight changes in gene expression within subclusters of each cell population from the early stages of injury response to the initiation and maintenance of remyelination. Our findings reveal how shifts in microglial, astrocytic and fibroblast activities within lesions are associated with efficient oligodendrocyte differentiation during remyelination.">

        <tr id="In the past decade, a major goal in biomedical research has been to understand why individuals differ in disease susceptibility, disease dynamics, and progression. In many pathologies, this variability stems from evolved immune mechanisms that resist inflammatory stress from various diseases that have been encountered throughout life. These may provide advantages against other diseases, reduce comorbidities, and enhance longevity. This study evaluates prior immunity as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, crucial for understanding plasmatic signaling cascades in different disease stages and their impact on disease progression. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, primarily affects the respiratory system and presents a wide range of symptoms, posing significant challenges to medicine. This study systematically analyzed prior immunity and inflammation in two independent cohorts of infected patients. A serological profile is determined by protein microarrays, which identify IgM and IgG responses against 37 prevalent microbial pathogens and provide a comprehensive plasma analysis of 21 acute-phase proteins. Our results reveal distinct serological profiles correlating with disease severity, indicating that immune system dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is linked to existing immunity. These findings highlight the relevance of prior immunity for monitoring disease progression, particularly in infections and vaccine failure, and underscore the importance of functional proteomics in determining prognostic biomarkers.">

Neurological symptoms include anxiety, depression and impaired short-term memory. However, the exact underlying mechanisms of long Covid are not yet decrypted. Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid.

How formation of specifically long-lived plasma cells is regulated via the interplay between specific B and CD4+ T cells is not well understood. Generally, antibody levels decline over time after clearance of the primary infection. Method In this study, convalescent individuals with stable RBD antibody levels (n=14, “sustainers”) were compared with donors (n=13) with the greatest antibody decline from a cohort of 132. To investigate the role of the cellular immune compartment in the maintenance of antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific responses at 4 to 6 weeks post-mild COVID-19 infection were characterized using deep immune profiling. Results Both groups had similar frequencies of total SARS-CoV-2-specific B and CD4+ T cells. Sustainers had fewer Spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells early after infection and increased neutralizing capacity of RBD antibodies over time, unlike the declining group. However, declining IgG titers correlated with lower frequency of Spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Conclusion These data suggest that “sustainers” have unique dynamics of GC reactions, yield different outputs of terminally differentiating cells, and improve the quality of protective antibodies over time.

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is adapting to continuous presence in humans. Transitions to endemic infection patterns are associated with changes in the spike (S) proteins that direct virus-cell entry. These changes generate antigenic drift and thereby allow virus maintenance in the face of prevalent human antiviral antibodies. These changes also fine tune virus-cell entry dynamics in ways that optimize transmission and infection into human cells. Focusing on the latter aspect, we evaluated the effects of several S protein substitutions on virus-cell membrane fusion, an essential final step in enveloped virus-cell entry. Membrane fusion is executed by integral-membrane “S2” domains, yet we found that substitutions in peripheral “S1” domains altered late-stage fusion dynamics, consistent with S1-S2 heterodimers cooperating throughout cell entry. A specific H655Y change in S1 stabilized a fusion-intermediate S protein conformation and thereby delayed membrane fusion. The H655Y change also sensitized viruses to neutralization by S2-targeting fusion-inhibitory peptides and stem-helix antibodies. The antibodies did not interfere with early fusion-activating steps; rather they targeted the latest stages of S2-directed membrane fusion in a novel neutralization mechanism. These findings demonstrate that single amino acid substitutions in the S proteins both reset viral entry—fusion kinetics and increase sensitivity to antibody neutralization. The results exemplify how selective forces driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and antibody evasion operate together to shape SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly impacted global health, affecting not only the immediate morbidity and mortality rates but also long-term health outcomes across various populations. Although the acute effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system have initially been the primary focus, it is increasingly evident that the virus can have significant impacts on multiple physiological systems, including the nervous and immune systems. The pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between viral infection, immune aging, and brain health, that can potentially accelerate neuroimmune aging and contribute to the persistence of long COVID conditions. By inducing chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and neuroinflammation, COVID-19 may exacerbate the processes of neuroimmune aging, leading to increased risks of cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases, and impaired immune function. Key factors include chronic immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the disruption of cellular processes. These overlapping mechanisms between aging and COVID-19 illustrate how the virus can induce and accelerate aging-related processes, leading to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases and other age-related conditions. This mini-review examines key features and possible mechanisms of COVID-19-induced neuroimmune aging that may contribute to the persistence and severity of long COVID. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective interventions. Anti-inflammatory therapies, neuroprotective agents, immunomodulatory treatments, and lifestyle interventions all hold potential for mitigating the long-term effects of the virus. By addressing these challenges, we can improve health outcomes and quality of life for millions affected by the pandemic.">

        <tr id="The persistence or emergence of long-term symptoms following resolution of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). PASC predominantly affects the cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune systems. Among these, the central nervous system (CNS) is significantly impacted, leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, brain fog, cognitive impairment, anosmia, hypogeusia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy (neuro-PASC). However, the risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms responsible for neuro-PASC remain unclear. This review hypothesis discusses the leading hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in long COVID/PASC, focusing on neuro-PASC. We propose vascular dysfunction mediated by activation of astrocytes and pericytes followed by blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological manifestations. Additionally, we provide insights into the role of spike protein at the blood–brain interface. Finally, we explore the potential pathogenic mechanisms initiated by the interaction between the spike protein and cellular receptors at the brain endothelial and tissue levels.">

        <tr id="Genome-wide association studies performed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have uncovered various loci significantly associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity. However, the underlying cis-regulatory genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their impact on clinical phenotypes remain enigmatic. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underscore the importance of expanding the study of regulatory variation to relevant cell types and disease contexts and argue for the existence of extensive gene-environment effects among patients responding to an infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is characterized by systemic pro-inflammatory shifts with the development of serious alterations in the functioning of the immune system. Investigations of the gene expression changes accompanying the infection state provide insight into the molecular and cellular processes depending on the sickness severity and virus variants. Severe Delta COVID-19 has been characterized by the appearance of a monocyte subset enriched for proinflammatory gene expression signatures and a shift in ligand–receptor interactions. We profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of 140,000 nuclei in PBMC samples from healthy individuals or individuals with COVID-19. We investigated cis-regulatory elements and identified the core transcription factors governing gene expression in immune cells during COVID-19 infection. In severe cases, we discovered that regulome and chromatin co-accessibility modules were significantly altered across many cell types. Moreover, cases with the Delta variant were accompanied by a specific monocyte subtype discovered using scATAC-seq data. Our analysis showed that immune cells of individuals with severe Delta COVID-19 underwent significant remodeling of the chromatin accessibility landscape and development of the proinflammatory expression pattern. Using a gene regulatory network modeling approach, we investigated the core transcription factors governing the cell state and identified the most pronounced chromatin changes in CD14+ monocytes from individuals with severe Delta COVID-19. Together, our results provide novel insights into cis-regulatory module organization and its impact on gene activity in immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major concern due to its astonishing prevalence and high fatality rate, especially among elderly people. Patients suffering from COVID-19 may exhibit immunosuppression in the initial stage of infection, while a cytokine storm can occur when the disease progresses to a severe stage. This inopportune immune rhythm not only makes patients more susceptible to the virus but also leads to numerous complications resulting from the excessive production of inflammatory factors. A20, which is widely accepted as a pivotal regulator of inflammation, has been shown to be implicated in the processes of antiviral responses and immunosuppression. Thus, A20 may participate in regulating the pathological processes of COVID-19.


METHODS
This narrative literature review summarizes recent evidence on the mechanisms of A20 in regulating the pathological processes of COVID-19. We also downloaded single-cell RNA-seq data sets from healthy individuals and patients with varying severities of COVID-19 from the NCBI GEO database to further dissect A20's regulatory mechanisms of these intricate cytokine pathways that are closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.


RESULTS
A20 might be one of the most critical anti-infectious and anti-inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. It effectively suppresses the immune damage and inflammatory storm caused by viral infection.


CONCLUSIONS
Understanding the relationship between A20-regulated signaling pathways and pathological processes of COVID-19 can provide insight into potential targets for intervention. Precise regulation of A20 to induce antiviral activity and an anti-inflammatory response could mediate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and could become an effective treatment.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a profound global impact since its emergence in late 2019. Characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress and death, COVID-19 has necessitated extensive research into the host-pathogen interactions that drive disease progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies. This study employed a multi-omic approach that combined direct RNA sequencing (DRS) and Illumina cDNA sequencing to investigate whole blood transcriptomic profiles in COVID-19 patients. By leveraging the unique capabilities of Nanopore DRS, which provides long-read sequencing data, we were able to capture not only gene expression levels but also crucial RNA modifications, including poly(A) tail length, non-adenine residue (non-A), pseudouridylation (psU), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation. This comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore the impact of these RNA modifications on gene expression and function within the context of COVID-19. Our findings reveal significant alterations in gene expression patterns, poly(A) tail lengths, non-A and the prevalence of psU and m5C modifications in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. These results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between viral infection, host immune response, and RNA processing, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

Methods We performed single-cell transcriptome coupled with T-cell/B-cell receptor (TCR/BCR) sequencing in 15 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from Omicron infection and naïve with booster vaccination. Results We found that after breakthrough infection, multiple cell clusters showed activation of the type I IFN pathway and widespread expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); T and B lymphocytes exhibited antiviral and proinflammatory-related differentiation features with pseudo-time trajectories; and large TCR clonal expansions were concentrated in effector CD8 T cells, and clonal expansions of BCRs showed a preference for IGHV3. In addition, myeloid cells in the BA.5.2 breakthrough infection with the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV were characterized by enhanced proliferation, chemotactic migration, and antigen presentation. Discussion Collectively, our study informs the comprehensive understandings of immune characterization for Omicron breakthrough infection, revealing the positive antiviral potential induced by booster doses of vaccine and the possible "trained immunity" phenomenon in the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV, providing a basis for the selection of vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids. SUMMARY The neurotropic Usutu virus can cause encephalitis driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment, microglia activation and blood-brain barrier disruption, all of which are inhibited by glucocorticoid treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a significant global public health challenge. While respiratory symptoms dominate, the virus's impact on other systems, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), has gained increasing attention. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates tropism for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, expressed in the olfactory epithelium, lungs, endothelium, kidneys, enterocytes, and neurons, contributing to neurological manifestations observed during the acute phase of the disease.  
Materials and Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. Keywords included: COVID-19, Post Acute COVID-19 Syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 Virus, Neurological Manifestations, and Central Nervous System Viral Diseases. A total of 58 articles were selected for analysis based on relevance and quality of evidence regarding neurological symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19.  
Basic Results: The acute phase of COVID-19 frequently involves neurological symptoms such as frontal and holocranial headaches, dizziness, gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, and alterations in consciousness. Severe complications, though less common, include encephalitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and myelitis. These conditions often present as altered mental status, seizures, aphasia, headaches, or focal deficits, contributing substantially to patient morbidity and mortality.  
Conclusions: Neurological symptoms and complications constitute a significant aspect of COVID-19, highlighting the virus's potential to affect the CNS. While severe complications are rare, their profound impact on prognosis underscores the importance of early recognition and management. Further research is essential to understand the pathophysiology and optimise therapeutic approaches for affected patients. ">

        <tr id="Aberrant and sustained activation of microglia is implicated in the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether intrinsic alterations in microglial function impact the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. We conducted transcriptomic and functional analyses of microglia-like cells (iMGLs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MS (pwMS) to answer this question. We generated iPSCs from six pwMS showing increased microglial activity via translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging. We demonstrated that the differentiated iMGL transcriptional profile resembled the microglial signature found in MS lesions. Importantly, compared with healthy controls, MS iMGLs presented cell-autonomous differences in their regulation of inflammation, both in the basal state and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide challenge. Through transcriptomic profiling, we showed that MS iMGLs display increased expression of genes known to be upregulated in MS microglia. Furthermore, upregulated genes in MS iMGLs were associated with immune receptor activation, antigen presentation, and the complement system, with known MS implications. Finally, functional analyses indicated that the transcriptional changes in MS iMGLs corresponded with alterations in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased phagocytosis. Together, our results provide evidence of putative cell-autonomous microglial activation in pwMS and identify transcriptomic and functional changes that recapitulate the phenotypes observed in vivo in microglia from pwMS. These findings indicate that MS disease-specific iPSCs are valuable tools for studying disease-specific microglial activation in vitro and highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets in MS.">

Yet, current clinical intervention strategies do not mitigate inflammation sequalae necessitating the development of innovative approaches to reduce inflammation and minimize deleterious effects of TBI. Herein, a subcutaneous formulation based on polymer of alpha-ketoglutarate (paKG) delivering glycolytic inhibitor PFK15 (PFKFB3 inhibitor, a rate limiting step in glycolysis), alpha-ketoglutarate (to fuel Krebs cycle) and peptide antigen from myelin proteolipid protein (PLP139-151) was utilized as the prophylactic immunosuppressive formulation in a mouse model of TBI. In vitro, the paKG(PFK15+PLP) vaccine formulation stimulated proliferation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and induced generation of T helper-2 cells. When given subcutaneously in the periphery to two weeks prior to mice sustaining a TBI, the active vaccine formulation increased frequency of immunosuppressive macrophages and dendritic cells in the periphery and the brain at day 7 post- TBI and by 28 days post-TBI enhanced PLP-specific immunosuppressive cells infiltrated the brain. While immunohistology measurements of neuroinflammation were not altered 28 days post-TBI, the vaccine formulation improved motor function and enhanced autophagy mediated genes in a spatial manner in the brain. Overall, these data suggest that the TBI vaccine formulation successfully induced an anti-inflammatory profile and decreased TBI-associated inflammation. Teaser In this study, a vaccine formulation was generated to develop central nervous specific immunosuppressive responses for TBI.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as a global pandemic pathogen with high mortality. While treatments have been developed to reduce morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, more antivirals with broad-spectrum activities are still needed. Here, we identified lonafarnib (LNF), a Food and Drug Administration–approved inhibitor of cellular farnesyltransferase (FTase), as an effective anti–SARS-CoV-2 agent. LNF inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and acted synergistically with known anti-SARS antivirals. LNF was equally active against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants. Mechanistic studies suggested that LNF targeted multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Using other structurally diverse FTase inhibitors and a LNF-resistant FTase mutant, we demonstrated a key role of FTase in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. To demonstrate in vivo efficacy, we infected SARS-CoV-2–susceptible humanized mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and treated them with LNF. LNF at a clinically relevant dose suppressed the viral titer in the respiratory tract and improved pulmonary pathology and clinical parameters. Our study demonstrated that LNF, an approved oral drug with excellent human safety data, is a promising antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that warrants further clinical assessment for treatment of COVID-19 and potentially other viral infections.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute COVID-19 infection causes significant alterations in the innate and adaptive immune systems. While most individuals recover naturally, some develop long COVID (LC) syndrome, marked by persistent or new symptoms weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, there are no clinical tests to distinguish LC patients from those fully recovered. Understanding the immunological basis of LC is essential for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches. Methods We performed deep immunophenotyping and functional assays to examine the immunological profiles of LC patients, individuals with active COVID-19, recovered patients, and healthy donors. This analysis assessed both innate and adaptive immune features, identifying potential biomarkers for LC syndrome. A Binomial Generalized Linear Model (BGLM) was used to pinpoint immune features characterizing LC. Results COVID-19 patients exhibited depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes, and monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells. Elevated basal inflammation was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to LC patients, whose immune profiles were closer to those of healthy donors and recovered individuals. However, LC patients displayed persistent immune alterations, including reduced T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Tregs) and switched memory B cells, similar to COVID-19 patients. Through BGLM, a unique adaptive immune signature for LC was identified, featuring memory CD8 and gd T cells with low proliferative capacity and diminished expression of activation and homing receptors. Discussion The findings highlight a unique immunological signature associated with LC syndrome, characterized by persistent adaptive immune dysregulation. While LC patients displayed recovery in innate immune profiles comparable to healthy and Recovered individuals, deficits in T cell and memory B cell populations were evident, differentiating LC from full recovery. These findings provide insights into LC pathogenesis and may support the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with the enveloped RNA betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, led to a global pandemic involving over 7 million deaths. Macrophage inflammatory responses impact COVID-19 severity; however, it is unclear whether macrophages are infected by SARS-CoV-2. We sought to identify mechanisms regulating macrophage expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and to determine if macrophages are susceptible to productive infection. We developed a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mouse whereby hACE2 cDNA was cloned into the mouse ACE2 locus under control of the native promoter. We validated susceptibility of hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to wild-type mice and an established K18-hACE2 model of acute fulminating disease. Intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 led to pulmonary consolidations with cellular infiltrate, edema, and hemorrhage, consistent with pneumonia, yet unlike the K18-hACE2 model, hACE2 mice survived and maintained stable weight. Infected hACE2 mice also exhibited a unique plasma chemokine, cytokine, and growth factor inflammatory signature relative to K18-hACE2 mice. Infected hACE2 mice demonstrated evidence of viral replication in infiltrating lung macrophages, and infection of macrophages in vitro revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of altered RNA and ribosomal processing machinery as well as activated cellular antiviral defense. Macrophage IL-1β-driven NF-κB transcription of ACE2 was an important mechanism of dynamic ACE2 upregulation, promoting macrophage susceptibility to infection. Experimental models of COVID-19 that make use of native hACE2 expression will allow for mechanistic insight into factors that can either promote host resilience or increase susceptibility to worsening severity of infection.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is central to temporal lobe epilepsy, yet the specific role of myeloid cells remains unclear. In status epilepticus (SE) models, circulating monocytes have been reported to infiltrate the brain, though distinguishing them from microglia remains challenging. Using a rat model, we traced infiltrating monocytes post-SE, to investigate their persistence, phenotypic evolution during epileptogenesis and contribution to neuroinflammation. By tracking phagocyted fluorescent nanoparticles and using CD68 immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that monocytes entered the brain in significant numbers 24 hours post-SE, after the inflammatory peak occurred (7h post-SE). Tracked up to 7 weeks, these cells adopted a microglia-like phenotype, contributed to the microglial scar and sustained low-grade inflammation during the chronic phase of epilepsy solely through their presence, as their expression of pro-inflammatory markers resembled that of non-activated microglia. Importantly, monocytes initially and transiently supported an anti-inflammatory response providing a unique opportunity to modulate neuroinflammation and potentially disrupt epilepsy progression, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), alarmed the global community due to the significant loss of human lives during the pandemic. However, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. A positive aspect of this recent pandemic has been that it stimulated scientists to create vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, accelerating the emergence of new therapeutic agents based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Numerous mRNA therapeutic products are currently in development, with dozens at various clinical trial stages. These products have facilitated significant changes in the paradigm of medical therapy, including the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although most of these cardiovascular mRNA therapeutics are still in preclinical development, phase IIa trials for myocardial ischemia therapy have already been completed with encouraging results. The scope of mRNA therapy for CVD is extremely broad, potentially even limitless, with ongoing research including conditions like myocardial ischemia, heart failure, arrhythmias, hypercholesterolemia, and occlusive arterial diseases. Moreover, mRNA can be used to enhance the effectiveness of cell therapies. In the future, researchers predict that mRNA therapies will not only replace some existing biopharmaceuticals and pharmacotherapy methods but also be applied to treat previously considered untreatable cardiovascular diseases.">

Data regarding functional roles of human T cells in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) viral clearance in primary COVID-19 are limited. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed samples for associations between SARS2 upper respiratory tract viral RNA levels and early virus-specific adaptive immune responses for 95 unvaccinated clinical trial participants with acute primary COVID-19 aged 18–86 years old, approximately half of whom were considered at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Functionality and magnitude of acute SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated, in addition to antibody responses. Most individuals with acute COVID-19 developed SARS2-specific T cell responses within 6 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Early CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were polyfunctional, and both strongly associated with reduced upper respiratory tract SARS2 viral RNA, independent of neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, these findings provide evidence for protective roles for circulating SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and long-term complications in bone health. Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces bone turnover and promotes bone loss, but the mechanism underlying worsened bone health remains elusive. This study sought to identify specific immune mediators that exacerbated preexisting IMIDs after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Plasma samples from 4 groups were analyzed: healthy, IMID only, COVID-19 only, and COVID-19 + IMID. Using high-throughput multiplexed proteomics, we profiled 1,500 protein biomarkers and identified 148 unique biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with IMIDs, including elevated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17F) and bone resorption markers. Long-term circulating SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, a virulence factor for COVID-19, was detected in the COVID + IMID group. RA was one of the most common IMIDs in our study. ORF8 treatment of RA-derived human osteoblasts (RA-hOBs) increased levels of inflammatory (TNF, IL6, CCL2) and bone resorption (RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio) markers compared with healthy controls. Supernatants from ORF8-treated RA-hOBs drove the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast-like cells. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exposure can exacerbate IMIDs through ORF8-driven inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19–induced bone pathologies.">

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, represents a significant and complex health challenge with a wide range of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the emerging evidence suggesting a critical role of the gut and gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of Long COVID. It explores how changes in the gut microbiome, disruption of gut barrier integrity, and the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens within the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to the prolonged and varied symptoms seen in Long COVID, including chronic inflammation and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The review also summarizes key insights gained about Long COVID, highlighting its multifactorial nature, which involves immune dysregulation, microvascular damage, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, with the gut playing a central role in these processes. While progress has been made in understanding these mechanisms, current evidence remains inconclusive. The challenges of establishing causality, standardizing research methodologies, and addressing individual variations in the microbiome are discussed, emphasizing the need for further longitudinal studies and more comprehensive approaches to enhance our understanding of these complex interactions. This review underscores the importance of personalized approaches in developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Long COVID, while also acknowledging the significant gaps in our current understanding. Future research should aim to further unravel the complex interplay between the gut and Long COVID, ultimately improving outcomes for those affected by this condition.">

        <tr id="Background
Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary, ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia, and other serious complications. Some populations have been observed to be at higher risk for severe disease and death compared to other ethnical groups.


Objective
To evaluate two parameters of the innate immune system, that play a significant role in viral immunity.


Methods
In samples of peripheral blood from sixteen patients with severe COVID-19, ten with asymptomatic to mild illness, and fifteen healthy subjects, the percentage of NK and NKT cells, the expression of different NK cell receptors and the blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were tested.


Results
We observed that patients with severe COVID-19 showed significantly lower frequencies of both CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells compared to patients with mild illness or healthy controls. Furthermore, patients with severe manifestation of COVID-19 exhibited an aberrant expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46. Similarly, NK cells from these patients showed statistically significant differences in the expression of various killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in the two main cell subsets (CD56bright, CD56dim) compared to controls or patients with mild disease. Moreover, patients with severe illness displayed decreased frequency of NKT cells (defined as CD3+CD56+) and elevated blood levels of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8.


Conclusion
This study suggests that the abnormal features of NK and NKT cells observed in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may play an important role in the outcome of this infectious disease in various population groups.">

Blood samples were collected from 50 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who visited of Al-Hussein Teaching hospital and 50 control people, during the period from (May -November 2021). The ages of the patients ranged from (Twenty two years to seventy six years). The serum samples were used in detection of TNF-α , IL-8 and IL-2  by using ELISA test. Then   the collected data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 11. The results showed that that the most affected age group was (40-60) years old followed by less than 40 years old and more than 60 years old. The numbers of patients were 29, 11 and 10 respectively. Most of COVID-19 patients were male (56 %:28), while the rest cases were females (44%:22). The mean values of the studied cytokines in COVID-19 patients in both sex and all age groups were more than their counter parters in H.C group. The effect of main risk factors for severe and long COVID-19 include age, sex, smoking, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension) on variations in the level of studied cytokines of the host were found significantly. Moreover, the effect of COVID-19 severity on the studied cytokines was highly significants. The maximum values of cytokines were obtaind in critical degree followed by severe and moderate severity.  It is concluded from the study's results that patients infected with severe SARS-CoV-2 experience increasing proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 that produce signaling the initial phase of cytokine storm. Thus, further studies should be conducted to use the studied cytokines inhibitors as a treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Severe systemic infections can trigger cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms and their impact on the manifestation and progression of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases are poorly understood. The current COVID-19 pandemic has brought a surge of severe viral illness and highlights the importance of understanding the impact of acute infections on cognition and the manifestation of neurodegenerative disease in survivors. A wealth of observational and clinical data suggests major short- and long-term effects of severe infections on cognition, but detailed and systematic analyses of neuropathological changes after acute infections are scarce. In order to bridge this gap and to provide insight into the cellular and molecular effects of severe systemic inflammation on hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, we performed immune profiling on the brains of recovered COVID-19 patients and of patients without a history of severe systemic infection.


METHOD
Immunohistochemical profiling of microglial, astrocytic, and oligodendrocytic morphological biomarkers was performed in human post-mortem tissue sourced from various brain regions. Glial coverage was directly quantified using immunohistochemical analysis software QuPath with custom parameters designed to adapt the program for detecting the different cell types. Multiplexed gene expression analysis of immune and neuroglia-related genes in human post-mortem tissue was performed using the Nanostring nCounter platform.


RESULT
Immunohistochemical profiling of glial cells in COVID-19 patients revealed a subtle but distinct difference in microglial activation, as well as differences in coverage of other glial sub-types, as compared to non-COVID patients, while no significant differences in disease-associated protein pathologies were observed. Multiplexed gene expression analysis corroborated these findings and also revealed significant shifts in oligodendrocyte and myelination-related transcriptomic profiles in COVID patients. A spatial component of COVID-19 was also observed, with a difference in severity of glial population shifts existing between brain regions.


CONCLUSION
These findings demonstrate a subtle, but distinct and long-lasting effect of severe systemic infections on the brain's innate immune system which may impact the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Gene expression analyses of patients suffering from COVID-19 also indicate significant alterations in the transcriptome of oligodendrocytes, and further investigation into the cross-talk between these cells and microglia should be performed.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 global pandemic, leads to a wide variety of responses among patients. Some of them present a very severe phenotype, while others only experience mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. This differential prognosis is tightly related to the inflammatory status of the patient. Although WHO declared the end of the emergency, the pandemic caused a great socio-sanitary impact in all countries. Thus, the possible outbreak of new biological diseases in the future makes it necessary to deepen the knowledge of this uncontrolled immune response and look for reliable biomarkers to help us predict its potential health impact. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) as lipoxins are endogenous mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid in the resolution stage of any inflammatory process. These lipids have pro-resolving actions in several pathological models, including reducing NF-κB-mediated inflammation, and inducing the antioxidant response through the Nrf-2 pathway. Thus, although a potential relationship has already been suggested between low levels of SPMs and COVID-19 severity, their true role as a predictive biomarker is still unknown.In this study, we have analyzed by ELISA the serum levels of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in a representative Spanish cohort. We found reduced levels in deceased patients when compared to mild or severe patients, concomitant with a decrease in the LXA4 biosynthetic pathway and an increase in its degradation pathway. Furthermore, we have studied the correlation between the levels of this SPM and several pathology indicators, finding a significant correlation between increased LXA4 levels and a better prognosis of the patients.We propose to measure systemic LXA4 as a new promising biomarker to predict the survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and presumably to other viruses that can affect humanity in the future.">

        <tr id="Background: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most widespread mosquito-borne virus, which can cause dengue fever with mild symptoms, or progress to fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. As the main target cells of DENV, macrophages are responsible for the innate immune response against the virus. Methods: In this study, we investigated the role of pyroptosis in the pathogenic mechanism of dengue fever by examining the level of pyroptosis in DENV-1-infected macrophages and further screened differentially expressed microRNAs by high-throughput sequencing to predict microRNAs that could affect the pyroptosis of the macrophage. Results: Macrophages infected with DENV-1 were induced with decreased cell viability, decreased release of lactate dehydrogenase and IL-1β, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, cleavage of GSDMD to produce an N-terminal fragment bound to cell membrane, and finally induced macrophage pyroptosis. MicroRNA expression profiles were obtained by sequencing macrophages from all periods of DENV-1 infection and comparing with the negative control. Sixty-three microRNAs differentially expressed in both the early and later stages of infection were also identified. In particular, miR-223-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-146a-5p and miR-34a-5p were recognized as small molecules that may be involved in the regulation of inflammation. Conclusions: In summary, this study aimed to understand the pathogenic mechanism of DENV through relevant molecular mechanisms and provide new targets for dengue-specific therapy.">

        <tr id="Background Several years after the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of trained immunity in COVID-19 remains controversial, and questions regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19 on immune cells remain unresolved. We investigated the roles of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination and latent infections in the progression of COVID-19 and sepsis. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of 97 individuals recovering from mild-to-critical COVID-19 and 64 sepsis patients. Immune cell frequencies, expression of functional markers, and plasma titres of anti-Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies were assessed and their impact on disease severity and outcomes were determined. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS. Results Post COVID-19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterized mainly by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post-critical COVID-19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. Additionally, a higher frequency of CMV and T. gondii seropositive-alongside a lower frequency of BCG seropositive-patients were associated with severe and critical COVID-19. However, the monocyte response to stimulation was unaffected by the severity of COVID-19. Conclusion These findings highlight the long-term alterations of immune cells in post-COVID-19 patients emphasizing the substantial impact of COVID-19 on immune function. However, our data showed no relationship between previous BCG vaccination and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) are critical for neuronal support functions, including myelination and remyelination. Emerging evidence reveals their active roles in neuroinflammation, particularly in conditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study explores the inflammatory translatome of OLCs during the early onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an established MS model. Using RiboTag-based RNA sequencing in genetically modified Olig2-Cre RiboTag mice, we identified 1,556 upregulated and 683 downregulated genes in EAE OLCs. Enrichment analysis indicated heightened immune-related pathways, such as cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and antigen presentation, while downregulated genes were linked to neuronal development and myelination. Notably, OLCs expressed cytokines/chemokines, and their receptor, highlighting their active involvement in neuroinflammatory signaling. Functional studies demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling in OLCs exacerbates EAE pathology by enhancing antigen presentation and chemokine production, whereas interferon-beta (IFN-β) signaling showed minimal impact. These findings provide novel insights into the inflammatory role of OLCs in EAE and suggest therapeutic potential in targeting OLC-mediated neuroinflammation for MS and related disorders.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The neuroimmune response, characterised by the proliferation and activation of microglial cells, is a driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the extent of immune cell infiltration and interactions in the human AD brain are yet to be established in detail. While microglial cells are at the centre of this neuroimmune response, recent research has explored the possibility of peripheral immune cell involvement, typically focusing on T-cell infiltration. There is currently a scarcity of studies using human tissues, with most of our understanding being derived from the study of animal models of AD-like pathology, which lack the complexity and diversity of the human condition. Our study aims to advance our understanding of the complex interplay of immune cells and signals, helping to define how the neuroimmune response plays a role in driving AD pathogenesis.


METHODS
We used two complementary techniques that provide a comprehensive map of the immune compartment through providing data rich results and spatial context. Samples were derived from human fresh-frozen and FFPE post-mortem tissues at all Braak stages, obtained from UK brain banks. We used fluorescence activated nuclei sorting to isolate the key cellular populations in the brain, as well as other non-resident immune cells. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing is used to establish not only the microglial transcriptional diversity in AD but also what other immune populations we see residing in the AD brain. Imaging mass cytometry, a highly quantitative technique that utilises up to 40 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously, has also been deployed to provide spatial context of the main microglial phenotypes and immune cell interactions via single-cell bioinformatic analysis.


RESULTS
Preliminary data suggests that there are populations of peripheral immune cells infiltrating into the brain during AD which could be impacting disease outcome. Distinct microglial phenotypes have also been detected which reflect results of recent human single-cell RNA sequencing studies. Future work includes increasing the sample number to further support our preliminary findings.


CONCLUSION
By understanding the complex interplay of immune cells, not only with one another but with pathological and physical hallmarks, we could significantly advance our comprehension of AD pathogenesis and steer research into preventative and/or treatment options.">

The phagocytic activity of leukocytes was studied in admitted patients with COVID-associated lung disease (n = 105). The mean age of the studied patients was 43.5 (37; 51) years; 69 for men, and 36 for women; the mean duration of the disease before hospitalization was 6 (4; 8) days. Using cluster analysis, two groups of patients (clusters) were formed according to the severity of COVID-19: Group 1 with the moderate course (n = 34) and Group 2 with the mild course (n = 71). Flow cytofluorimetry with determination of neutrophil (NI) and monocyte index (MI) was used to determine the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes in the peripheral blood.Results. The median NI in the studied patients was 97.9% (96.3; 99); the mean median MI was 91.2% (84.6; 95). The correlation analysis revealed statistically significant direct correlation of MI with SpO2 level (r = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.005 – 0.39; p = 0.04); inverse correlation of MI with CRP level (r = –0.31; 95% CI: –0.11 to –0.48; p = 0.003) and degree of lung damage by CT (r = –0.2; 95% CI: –0.11 to –0.48); p = 0.05). MI in the group with moderate course was statistically significantly lower than in the group with mild course of COVID-19 (86.7 (81.4; 91.7) and 92.6 (86.5; 95.4), p = 0.01). The blood MI of the initially more severe patients statistically significantly increased.Conclusion. Complicated forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection lead to a decrease in phagocytic activity of the monocytic-macrophage link of innate immunity. The degree of decrease in monocyte phagocytic activity is directly related to the severity of COVID-19, and the MI is comparable in the patients with severe and mild course after 30 days of treatment.">

        <tr id="Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are a major cause of morbidity largely due to lack of prevention and inadequate treatments. While mortality from viral CNS infections is significant, nearly two thirds of the patients survive. Thus, it is important to understand how the human CNS can successfully control virus infection and recover. Since it is not possible to study the human CNS throughout the course of viral infection at the cellular level, here we analyzed a non-lethal viral infection in the CNS of nonhuman primates (NHPs). We inoculated NHPs intracerebrally with a high dose of La Crosse virus (LACV), a bunyavirus that can infect neurons and cause encephalitis primarily in children, but with a very low (≤ 1%) mortality rate. To profile the CNS response to LACV infection, we used an integrative approach that was based on comprehensive analyses of (i) spatiotemporal dynamics of virus replication, (ii) identification of types of infected neurons, (iii) spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and (iv) morphological and functional changes in CNS intrinsic and extrinsic cells. We identified the location, timing, and functional repertoire of optimal transcriptional and translational regulation of the primate CNS in response to virus infection of neurons. These CNS responses involved a well-coordinated spatiotemporal interplay between astrocytes, lymphocytes, microglia, and CNS-border macrophages. Our findings suggest a multifaceted program governing an optimal CNS response to virus infection with specific events coordinated in space and time. This allowed the CNS to successfully control the infection by rapidly clearing the virus from infected neurons, mitigate damage to neurophysiology, activate and terminate immune responses in a timely manner, resolve inflammation, restore homeostasis, and initiate tissue repair. An increased understanding of these processes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve outcomes of viral CNS diseases in humans.">

        <tr id="The long-term effects of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations on adaptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.">

        <tr id="The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection is reported to begin with the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human body through droplets, entering the lungs, and binding to the ACE-2 receptor. Meanwhile, activated macrophages stimulate an immune and inflammatory response, activating the coagulation cascade. This activation in COVID-19 patients can exacerbate the condition and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The coagulation cascade is influenced by the expression of related genes, including F3, F5, F8, F12, F13A1, VWF, THBD, PROC, PROCR, PROS1, SERPINE1, A2M, and PLAUR. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022, with 22 mild COVID-19 cases, 35 moderate-to-severe cases, and 20 healthy control individuals from Dr. M. Djamil Padang General Hospital in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Coagulation gene expression data using the RNA-Seq method with transcriptomic analysis were collected and recorded in transcript per-million (TPM) units. The results showed a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes in moderate-to-severe compared to mild COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The analysis of log2 folds change has a statistically significant increase observed in the expression of coagulation genes and a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes among moderate-to-severe and mild patients, as well as healthy controls. The results underscored the impact of COVID-19 infection on the activity of coagulation cascade genes, which could influence the condition of patients and serve as a reference for therapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Microglia are the major innate immune cells of the brain and play diverse roles in brain development and homeostasis. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, microglia acquire new phenotypes that can exert protective or pathogenic roles. Single cell and single nuclei RNA sequencing experiments have defined molecular signatures of different disease-associated microglia states associated with protective or pathogenic functions, but the mechanisms driving these transitions are not known. As a general approach to this question, we are performing a quantitative analysis of the epigenetic landscapes of mouse and human microglia subsets in models of amyloid pathology.


METHOD
In collaboration with the Butovsky and Henna laboratories, we defined amyloid responsive enhancers in aged APP/PS1 mice using ATAC seq. In collaboration with the Blurton-Jones laboratory, we used ATAC-seq to perform quantitative analysis of enhancers in homeostatic, MHCII-high and CD9-high human microglia engrafted into humanized 5XFAD mice. We integrated these findings with patterns of transcription factor expression and changes in gene expression.


RESULT
The responses of both mouse and human microglia to amyloid pathology in vivo was associated with significant increases in ATAC-seq signal at more than 1400 genomic locations. A large fraction of these locations correspond to putative enhancers. More than ten distinct transcription factor motifs were identified in both mouse and human amyloid responsive ATAC-seq peaks. There was a near complete overlap of these motifs in both mouse and human microglia, which were associated with a similar set of expressed transcription factors. A subset of these factors was evaluated for their potential roles in regulating amyloid responsive genes using human iPSC derived microglia and mouse macrophage systems. Although the transcription factor motifs identified in amyloid responsive ATAC-seq peaks were nearly identical between mouse and human microglia, there was substantial divergence in the downstream genes they regulated.


CONCLUSION
These studies indicate that the response to amyloid involves many transcription factors, nominates specific factors for further study, and reinforces the value of engrafting human microglia into disease models as a means of investigating the impact of human-specific non coding regulatory elements.">

        <tr id="Microglia play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and display remarkable plasticity in their response to inflammatory stimuli. However, the specific signaling profiles that microglia adopt during such challenges remain incompletely understood. Traditional transcriptomic approaches provide valuable insights, but fail to capture dynamic post-translational changes. In this study, we utilized time-resolved single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to measure distinct signaling pathways activated in microglia upon exposure to bacterial and viral mimetics-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the immunomodulatory role of astrocytes on microglial signaling in mixed cultures. Microglia or mixed cultures derived from neonatal mice were treated with LPS or Poly(I:C) for 48 h. Cultures were stained with a panel of 33 metal-conjugated antibodies targeting signaling and identity markers. High-dimensional clustering analysis was used to identify emergent signaling modules. We found that LPS treatment led to more robust early activation of pp38, pERK, pRSK, and pCREB compared to Poly(I:C). Despite these differences, both LPS and Poly(I:C) upregulated the classical reactivity markers CD40 and CD86 at later time points. Strikingly, the presence of astrocytes significantly blunted microglial responses to both stimuli, particularly dampening CD40 upregulation. Our studies demonstrate that single-cell mass cytometry effectively captures the dynamic signaling landscape of microglia under pro-inflammatory conditions. This approach may pave the way for targeted therapeutic investigations of various neuroinflammatory disorders. Moreover, our findings underscore the necessity of considering cellular context, such as astrocyte presence, in interpreting microglial behavior during inflammation.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a respiratory disease that can range in presentation from mild symptoms to severe conditions such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus, spreads through aerosols and respiratory droplets. It enters human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, leading to various complications, including significant alterations in red blood cells and potential disruptions in haemoglobin function and oxygen transport. During infection, the interaction between hypoxia, inflammation, and haematopoiesis affects erythropoiesis at multiple levels. Hypoxia and inflammation, resulting from lung complications and a reduced red blood cell count, influence the regulation of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron levels in the blood. Elevated hepcidin levels are associated with hypoxia and the suppression of erythroferrone, a hormone that normally inhibits hepcidin production. Despite high levels of inflammation, patients in intensive care units often exhibit elevated ferritin levels, which, rather than indicating low hepcidin, suggest disrupted iron metabolism and the development of severe anaemia. Iron is kept in stores, likely due to paradoxically high hepcidin levels, which explains the elevated ferritin measurements. An increase in immature blood cells and a decrease in CD71+ erythroid cells are observed. The elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells highlight their dual role in modulating hyper-inflammation and immune response during disease progression. This review examines the pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 affects red blood cell production and the haematopoietic system and how it triggers cytokine storms through interleukins, immature blood cells, and CD71+ erythroid cells. Understanding these processes provides novel pathways for managing haematological manifestations and immune responses in patients with COVID-19.">

Ocular symptoms, though uncommon, include conjunctivitis, dry eye, and blurred vision. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in ocular surface epithelial cells, facilitating viral entry, replication, and local dissemination. The innate immune responses involving corneal epithelial cells and immune cells are discussed, alongside mechanisms of antigen presentation and adaptive immunity. The review also examines the roles of cytokines and chemokines in mediating ocular surface inflammation and explores the impact of cytokine storms and chronic inflammation on ocular health. Additionally, the interplay between systemic and ocular immune responses is highlighted, analyzing how systemic COVID-19 inflammation influences ocular surface health. These insights underscore the broader implications of COVID-19 beyond localized ocular infection. By consolidating current findings, this review aims to guide preventive and therapeutic strategies while identifying directions for future research to mitigate the ocular consequences of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting from an abnormal immune response to normal stimuli, such as food and intestinal flora. Since the etiology of this disease remains largely unknown, murine models induced by the consumption of dextran-sodium sulfate serve as a pivotal tool for studying colon inflammation. In this study, we employed both acute and chronic colitis mouse models induced by varying durations of dextran-sodium sulfate consumption to investigate the pathological and immunologic characteristics throughout the disease course. During the acute phase, activated innate inflammation marked by M1 macrophage infiltration was prominent. In contrast, the chronic phase was characterized by tissue remodeling, with a significant increase in M2 macrophages and lymphocytes. RNA-sequencing revealed genetic changes in acute and chronic colitis, marked by the maintenance of genomic integrity in the acute phase and extracellular matrix dynamics in the chronic phase. These phase-specific alterations reflect the multifaceted physiological processes involved in the initiation and progression of inflammation in the large intestine, underscoring the necessity for distinct experimental approaches for each phase. The findings demonstrate that the factors shaping the large intestinal immune microenvironment change specifically during the acute and chronic phases of experimental inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting the importance of developing therapeutic strategies that align with the disease course.">

        <tr id="Persistent Covid (PC) represents a post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by symptoms that persist for more than 12 weeks after the acute phase. These symptoms, which include chronic fatigue, respiratory distress, cognitive dysfunction, and other multisystem effects, significantly impact the quality of life of the affected individuals. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood, although studies have suggested a multifactorial origin. Proposed factors include viral persistence, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation disturbances, and gut dysbiosis. The identification of these mechanisms could facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, opening new perspectives for the effective management of persistent Covid. The diagnosis of PC is complex due to the diversity of symptoms and the lack of specific biomarkers. At present, therapeutic approaches focus primarily on symptomatic relief, but further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying PC and to develop targeted interventions.

        <tr id="By the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had diffused widely across the globe, with 770 million infected individuals and over 7 million deaths reported. In addition to its high infectivity and pathogenicity and its rapid mutation rate, the unique capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to circumvent the immune system has also contributed to the widespread nature of this pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 elicits the onset of innate immune system activation and initiates antiviral responses once it has infected the host. While battling the host’s immune responses, SARS-CoV-2 has established many countermeasures to evade attack and clearance. As the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 continues, substantial evidence has revealed that the 29 proteins synthesized by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are integral to the viral infection process. They not only facilitate viral replication and transmission, but also assist SARS-CoV-2 in escaping the host’s immune defenses, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets that have attracted considerable attention in recent studies. This review summarizes the manner in which SARS-CoV-2 interfaces with the innate immune system, with a particular focus on the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications of mutations.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses cause nearly 1 billion global infections annually and are associated with a diverse array of human illnesses. Among these, myocarditis and the resulting chronic inflammation have been recognized as major contributing factors to virus-induced heart failure. Despite our growing understanding, very limited therapeutic strategies have been developed to address the pathological consequences of virus-induced chronic innate immune activation. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was used as a model cardiotropic enterovirus. We leveraged in vitro cell-based studies to investigate cardiomyocyte and macrophage interaction during CVB3 infection, as well as animal studies and unique human cardio specimens to evaluate mechanisms of viral heart injury. We present evidence that viral myocarditis is in part exacerbated by pathological activation of the complement pathway in cells, mice, and human cardiac tissues. We demonstrate unique cell type-specific responses to viral infection that are exacerbated by mitochondrial injury in cardiomyocytes and NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in macrophages. Macrophages are robustly activated by damage-associated mitochondrial components, including mitochondrial proteins and lipid extracts. Mechanistically, we identify complement protective factors CD59/protectin and CD55/DAF as novel targets of viral proteinase that acts to release the brakes on complement-mediated autoinjury. Collectively, our study highlights a novel mechanism that can act as a potential contributor to CVB3 pathogenesis through mitochondrial injury-mediated autoimmunity.


IMPORTANCE
This study sheds light on how enteroviruses, specifically coxsackievirus B3, may contribute to heart failure by triggering harmful immune responses in the heart. We discovered that viral infections in heart cells cause mitochondrial damage, which in turn activates a destructive immune response involving the complement system. This immune activation is one of the significant contributors that lead to further injury of heart tissues, worsening the damage caused by the virus. Additionally, we identified key protective molecules that are targeted and disrupted by the virus, allowing the immune system to attack the heart even more aggressively. Understanding these mechanisms may provide additional insights into how viral infections can lead to chronic heart conditions and suggests potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reduce heart damage in patients affected by viral myocarditis.">

        <tr id="Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making them a significant public health concern. During infection, respiratory viruses, including Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), trigger an antiviral immune response, specifically boosting the inflammatory response that plays a critical role in their pathogenesis. The inflammatory response induced by respiratory viruses can be a double-edged sword since it can be initially induced to be antiviral and protective/reparative from virus-induced injuries. Still, it can also be detrimental to host cells and tissues. However, the mechanisms that differentiate the complex crosstalk between favorable host inflammatory responses and harmful inflammatory responses are poorly understood. This review explores the complex interplay between viral pathogens and the host immune response, mainly focusing on the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of VRIs. We discuss how inflammation can both contain and exacerbate the progression of viral infections, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and emerging drugs for modulating the aberrant inflammatory responses during VRIs.">

Severe COVID-19, defined by a hyperinflammatory state, is greatly impacted by underlying chronic illnesses aggravating the cytokine storm caused by increased levels of Pro-inflammatory cytokines. Metabolic reprogramming, including increased glycolysis and altered mitochondrial function, promotes viral replication and stimulates inflammatory cytokine production, contributing to illness severity. Mitochondrial metabolism abnormalities, strongly linked to various systemic illnesses, worsen metabolic dysfunction during and after the pandemic, increasing cardiovascular consequences. Long COVID-19, defined by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, poses continuous problems, highlighting the need for comprehensive therapy solutions that address both immunological and metabolic aspects.

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Oligodendrocytes (OL) and their myelin-forming processes are targeted and lost during the disease course of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), targeted by infiltrating leukocytes and their effector cytokines. Myelin repair is considered to be dependent on recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The basis of failure of re-myelination during the disease course of MS remains to be defined. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of pro-inflammatory molecules tumor necrosis factor ⍰ (TNF⍰) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) on the differentiation of human OPCs. Methods We generated human OPCs from induced pluripotent stem cells with a reporter gene under the OL-specific transcription factor SOX10. We treated the cells in vitro with TNF⍰ or IFNγ and evaluated effects in terms of cell viability, expression of OL-lineage markers, and co- expression of astrocyte markers. To relate our findings to the molecular properties of OPCs as found in the MS brain we re-analyzed publicly available single nuclear RNAseq datasets. Results Our analysis indicated that both TNF⍰ and IFNγ decreased the proportion of cells differentiating into the OL-lineage; consistent with previous reports. We now observe the TNF⍰ effect is linked to aberrant OPC differentiation. A subset of O4+, reporter-positive cells co- expressed the astrocytic marker Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). On the transcriptomic level, the cells acquire an astrocyte-like signature alongside a conserved reactive phenotype. Analysis of single- nuclear RNAseq datasets from human MS brain revealed a subset of OPCs expressing an astrocytic signature. Discussion In the context of MS, these results imply that OPCs are present but inhibited from differentiating along the OL-lineage, with a subset acquiring a reactive and stem-cell like phenotype, reducing their capacity to contribute towards repair. These findings help define a potential basis for the impaired myelin repair in MS and provide a prospective route for regenerative treatment.">

        <tr id="CNS-resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells populate the haematoma in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), but the contribution of these cell populations to injury and repair has been controversial. To better characterise myeloid cell changes over time, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a unique paired dataset of live haematoma and peripheral blood samples from 10 ICH patients. This work presents a temporal atlas of ICH myeloid populations and identifies population-specific in-situ transcriptional drivers. In addition to distinct populations of activated microglia and TNF-low microglia, we found a unique and highly activated population of CD14+ monocytes in the haematoma. Perturbation analysis comparing haematoma-associated monocytes to shared populations in blood and haematomas identified TNF signalling as the primary driver of their activation. Employing a custom temporal trajectory analysis based on the embeddings of a single-cell foundation model, we found that this TNF response in monocytes was transient, peaking early after haemorrhage and decreasing over the ensuing 48 hours. Our analysis further identified a transient population of highly activated microglia as the likely source of TNF during the acute stage of ICH. Acute TNF signalling in CD14+ monocytes associated with better adjusted outcomes both in our and external cohorts. Overall, our results suggest that acute TNF signalling between transient populations of activated microglia and unique haematoma-associated monocytes could potentially be beneficial in recovery after ICH.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Genetic studies indicate a causal role for microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the progress made in identifying genetic risk factors, such as CD33, and underlying molecular changes, there are currently limited treatment options for AD. Based on the immune‐inhibitory function of CD33, we hypothesize that inhibition of CD33 activation may reverse microglial suppression and restore their ability to resolve inflammatory processes and mitigate pathogenic amyloid plaques, which may be neuroprotective. Here, we investigate the effects of a competitive inhibitor peptide of CD33 binding, IMAD‐001, on downstream immune response in AD. Method Primary human monocyte‐derived microglia‐like cells (MDMi) and monocytes were treated with IMAD‐001 and we determined its effect on microglial function and immune signaling by measuring gene expression changes in markers of microglial activation by qPCR and amyloid beta (Aβ) uptake by flow cytometry. To measure the in vivo effects, we treated 12‐month‐old 5xFAD mice with weekly subcutaneous injections of 5mg/kg IMAD‐001 or vehicle control for 28 days and examined Aβ clearance by immunohistochemistry and CNS immune cell phenotypes by single‐cell (sc)RNA‐seq. Result IMAD‐001 treatment increased Aβ uptake in primary monocytes. In in vivo experiments, we see clearance of Aβ in the brains of the 5xFAD mice with weekly administration. Using scRNA‐seq of CD45+ cells, we identified the expected populations in the brains of the animals and found that peptide treated mice had an increase in classical dendritic cells and a slight decrease in disease‐associated microglia (DAM) and homeostatic microglia. Microglia cells regulated their phenotype in response to the peptide as well with notable downregulation of CD274/PD‐L1, an immunosuppressive molecule in which disruption of its interaction with PD‐1 was found to clear Aβ and improve cognitive performance. Interestingly, peptide treatment resulted in downregulation of IFITM3 and upregulation of CD74, suggesting CD33 inhibition influences microglia to inhibit Aβ production. Conclusion IMAD‐001 inhibition of CD33 resolved Aβ induced suppressed microglial immune signaling and increased microglial phagocytosis and response to their environment in vitro and in vivo, without inducing inappropriate activation, suggesting its potential for therapeutic use in AD.">

        <tr id="The pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is characterized by a complex of interactions within viral factors, abnormal haemostasis, dysfunction of endothelial cells, and inflammatory reactions, necessitating the research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. Severe COVID-19 conditions are frequently coupled with an increased immunological response, dubbed a cytokine storm, which facilitates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha). The cytokine storm contributes to widespread inflammation and endothelial activation, disrupting the balance between pro-coagulant and anticoagulant factors. Additionally, it is capable of being transmitted by contacting surfaces that are contaminated and then rubbing the face. Biomarkers such as D-dimer levels serve as valuable tools in risk assessment and monitoring, yet their interpretation requires careful consideration within the clinical context. Although some COVID-19 patients may not exhibit any symptoms, they can still spread the virus to others, and there is proof that the virus can spread via the air in some environments, especially confined areas with inadequate ventilation.

        <tr id="Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), marked by inflammation, demyelination, and significant oligodendrocyte injury. This disease arises from a complex interplay of genetic predispositions and environmental triggers that drive immune-mediated damage to oligodendrocytes and myelin proteins. 
This research paper explores the multifaceted aspects of oligodendrocyte injury in MS, ranging from underlying pathophysiological mechanisms to potential therapeutic interventions and translational implications for clinical practice. 
Oligodendrocyte damage in MS occurs via multiple mechanisms, including metabolic stress, oxidative damage, and cytokine-induced apoptosis, mainly mediated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling. This process exacerbates neuroinflammation and contributes to disease progression. Emerging therapeutic strategies, such as targeting metabolic pathways, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing autophagy, have demonstrated potential in preclinical studies. Furthermore, stem cell therapies are being explored for their ability to regenerate oligodendrocytes and restore myelin integrity. 
Conclusions: The intricate interplay among oligodendrocyte injury, demyelination, and neuroinflammation is central to multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Oligodendrocytes safeguard myelin in the CNS, facing challenges from immune attacks to metabolic stress. Understanding oligodendrocyte dysfunction is vital for targeted therapies that suppress immune damage and promote remyelination and CNS repair. MS's etiology,">

        <tr id="In multiple sclerosis (MS), microglia and macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in determining the balance among demyelination, neurodegeneration, and myelin repair. Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the lack of therapies aimed at promoting remyelination and slowing disease progression for individuals with MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, shifts the transcriptional programs of microglia and CNS-associated macrophages from a proinflammatory phenotype to a regenerative phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 stimulated scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that prevented the activation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes while also promoting neuroaxonal health and oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment of mice with bryo-1 augmented remyelination after a focal demyelinating injury. Our results demonstrate the potential of bryo-1 and possibly a wider class of PKC modulators as myelin-regenerative and supportive agents in MS and other neurologic diseases.">

 Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe psoriatic subtype characterized by epidermal neutrophil infiltration, often occurring in acute, potentially life-threatening episodes. However, the characterization of the immune microenvironment in GPP lesions compared with plaque psoriasis remains largely unknown. Here, we used single-cell RNA profiling to interrogate the transcriptomes of ∼60 000 single cells from GPP lesional skin (n = 13) and healthy adult skin (n = 4), combined with spatial RNA sequencing. GPP was associated with major shifts in multiple cell populations, including, in particular, increased frequency of myeloid immune cells and supraspinous keratinocytes. We identified a unique myeloid-derived neutrophil subset characterized by the absence of CASP8. CASP8− neutrophils were accompanied by high expression of inflammatory pathway genes, including RIPK1, NF-KB1, IL1B, CXCL1, and CXCL8 in a stable disease state and were found at low levels in an inactive state in healthy skin. Spatial mapping of these genes illustrated the neutrophil transition from pre-inflammation to a pro-inflammation state through casting off CASP8. In silico and in vitro co-culture studies demonstrated that the communication network between IL36G+ spinous KCs and neutrophils is enlarged in the GPP lesions, with TNFSF15 (TL1A) released from neutrophils exaggerating the inflammatory crosstalk. While there was a slight increase in Th17 cells, there was greater prominence of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells highlighted by upregulated GZMB, CCL5, NKG7, and PRF1 expression, hinting at a cytotoxicity tendency rather than inflammation response in GPP lesions. Notably, a subset of S100A9+ fibroblasts in GPP was observed to contribute to the amplification of the GPP immune network through the transition to a pro-inflammatory state, connected by ligand–receptor interactions with other spatially proximate immune cells, including Th17 cells, CD8+ Tc cells, neutrophils, and IL1B+ macrophages. In sum, these data provide an in-depth view of immune cell participation and highlight the role of neutrophil–KC–fibroblast crosstalk in GPP pathogenesis.">

We will illustrate that this neuro-endocrine-metabolic axis is closely interconnected and how the SARS-CoV-2 can damage it at all stages through direct, immune-inflammatory, epigenetic damage mechanisms, as well as through the reactivation of neurotropic viruses. According to our theory, the direct mitochondrial damage carried out by the virus, which replicates within these organelles, and the cellular oxidative imbalance, cannot be countered in patients who develop LC. This is because their anti-inflammatory mechanisms are inconsistent due to reduced vagal tone and direct damage to the endocrine glands of the HPA axis. We will illustrate how acetylcholine (ACh) and cortisol, with its cytoplasmatic and cellular receptors respectively, are fundamental players in the LC process. Both Ach and cortisol play multifaceted and synergistic roles in reducing inflammation. They achieve this by modulating the activity of innate and cell-mediated immunity, attenuating endothelial and platelet activation, and modulating mitochondrial function, which is crucial for cellular energy production and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In our opinion, it is essential to study the sensitivity of the glucocorticoids receptor in people who develop LC and whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause long-term epigenetic variations in its expression and function.">

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

Coronaviruses are well-known to have a negative impact on the lungs and cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 induces a cytokine storm that primarily targets the lungs, causing widespread clinical disorders, including COVID-19. Although, SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals often show no or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Novel CoV-2 infection in 2019 resulted in viral pneumonia as well as other complications and extrapulmonary manifestation. ARDS is also linked to a higher risk of death.

        <tr id="The Flaviviridae are a family of viruses that include the important arthropod-borne human pathogens dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus. Flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is essential for virus replication but is also secreted from virus-infected cells. Extracellular NS1 acts as a virulence factor during flavivirus infection in multiple ways, including triggering endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak via interaction with endothelial cells. While the role of NS1 in inducing vascular leak and exacerbating pathogenesis is well appreciated, if and how NS1-triggered endothelial dysfunction promotes virus infection remains obscure. Flaviviruses have a common need to disseminate from circulation into specific tissues where virus-permissive cells reside. Tissue-specific dissemination is associated with disease manifestations of a given flavivirus, but mechanisms dictating virus dissemination are unclear. Here we show that NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction promotes virus dissemination in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models of DENV infection, we show that anti-NS1 antibodies decrease virus dissemination, while the addition of exogenous NS1 promotes virus dissemination. Using an in vitro system, we show that NS1 promotes virus dissemination in two distinct ways: (1) promoting crossing of barriers and (2) increasing infectivity of target cells in a tissue- and virus-specific manner. The capacity of NS1 to modulate infectivity correlates with a physical association between virions and NS1, suggesting a potential NS1-virion interaction. Taken together, our study indicates that flavivirus NS1 promotes virus dissemination across endothelial barriers, providing an evolutionary basis for virus-triggered vascular leak. Author Summary The Flaviviridae contain numerous medically important human pathogens that cause potentially life-threatening infections. Over half of the world’s population is at risk of flavivirus infection, and this number is expected to increase as climate change expands the habitats of the arthropod vectors that transmit these flaviviruses. There are few effective vaccines and no therapeutics approved for prevention or treatment of flavivirus infection, respectively. Given these challenges, understanding how and why flaviviruses cause pathogenesis is critical for identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. The secreted nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of flaviviruses is a conserved virulence factor that triggers endothelial dysfunction in a tissue-specific manner. It is unknown if this endothelial dysfunction provides any benefit for virus infection. Here we provide evidence that NS1-triggered endothelial dysfunction facilitates virus crossing of endothelial barriers and augments infection of target cells in vitro and promotes virus dissemination in vivo. This study provides an evolutionary explanation for flaviviruses evolving the capacity to trigger barrier dysfunction and highlights NS1 and the pathways governing endothelial dysfunction, as therapeutic targets to prevent flavivirus dissemination.">

Although SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been responsible for pneumonia,
recent studies indicate that it also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain, among other vital organs.
Evidence suggests that this virus may travel retrogradely from the olfactory epithelium to brain
stem sections, causing neurological impairments in a significant number of individuals. Individuals
with severe COVID-19 frequently have elevated cytokines that promote inflammation and acute
respiratory failure and require frequent supportive ventilation. These factors are believed to contribute
to cognitive deterioration. Severe neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients include- paralysis,
stroke, cranial nerve deficits, delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, and meningitis. The virus, with
its unique structure, and a high binding affinity for the human enzyme ACE2 (used as an entry point
by the virus), contributes significantly to its deadly nature. Furthermore, to address the outbreak effectively,
researchers worldwide must develop precise treatment strategies. Advancing new diagnostic
and treatment methods to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on cognition requires further
epidemiological research and clinical experience. Additionally, by understanding the virus's
impact on cognitive functions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted treatments to alleviate
these severe neurological consequences.

        <tr id="A positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that devastated the world. While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID- 19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.">

        <tr id="Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke with a lack of effective treatments. Following disease onset, ICH activates microglia and recruits peripheral leukocytes into the perihematomal region to amplify neural injury. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) controls the proliferation and survival of various myeloid cells and lymphocytes. However, the role of BTK in neuroinflammation and ICH injury remains poorly understood. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from ICH patients and healthy controls to measure BTK expression profile in immune cell subsets. C57BL/6 mice were used to measure BTK expression and the activity of immune cell subsets following ICH induction. Neurological tests, brain water content, Evans blue leakage, MRI were used to assess the therapeutic effects of ibrutinib on ICH injury. Flow cytometry was used to investigate immune cell infiltration and microglial activity. Microglia were depleted using a CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622. Gr-1+ myeloid cells and B cells were depleted using monoclonal antibodies. Microglia-like BV2 cells were cultured to test the effects of BTK inhibition on these cells. Results: In humans and mice, we found that BTK was remarkably upregulated in myeloid cells after ICH. Inhibition of BTK using ibrutinib led to reduced neurological deficits, perihematomal edema, brain water content and blood-brain barrier disruption. BTK inhibition suppressed the inflammatory activity of microglia and brain infiltration of leukocytes. In contrast, BTK inhibition did not alter the counts of peripheral immune cells other than B cells. Further, the depletion of microglia or Gr-1+ myeloid cells ablated the protective effects of BTK inhibition against ICH injury. Notably, the depletion of B cells did not alter the protective effects of BTK inhibition against ICH injury. This suggests that the benefit of BTK inhibition in ICH mainly involves its impact on microglia and Gr-1+ myeloid cells. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that BTK inhibition attenuates neuroinflammation and ICH injury, which warrants further investigation as a potential therapy for ICH.">

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) has long been considered an immune-privileged site, where immune responses are tightly regulated to protect neural tissue from inflammation-induced damage. Immune privilege in the CNS is maintained through various mechanisms, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the absence of conventional lymphatic drainage, the specialized function of CNS-resident immune cells, and the expression of immunosuppressive molecules like TGF-β and IL-10. These protective systems are essential for preserving CNS homeostasis, as uncontrolled immune activity in the CNS can lead to irreversible damage to neurons and glial cells. However, immune privilege is not absolute. In neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and Alzheimer’s disease, immune privilege is breached, resulting in the infiltration of immune cells, chronic inflammation, and progressive neural damage. The breakdown of the BBB, immune cell activation, and dysregulated inflammation contribute to the pathophysiology of these diseases. This review examines the mechanisms that underlie immune privilege in the CNS, how these systems are compromised in neuroinflammatory conditions, and the therapeutic implications for modulating immune responses in the CNS. Targeted therapies aimed at restoring immune regulation and preserving CNS function offer promising prospects for treating neuroinflammatory diseases and maintaining CNS health.

The neuroimmune interactions between peripheral and central immune systems in angiostrongyliasis remain unclear. In this study, significant infiltration of eosinophils, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and Ly6C monocytes is observed in the brains of AC-infected mice, with macrophages being the most abundant. RNA-seq and SMART-seq analysis of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and DNA sensor gene sets revealed a marked increase in Z-DNA binding protein 1 (Zbp1) expression in infected mice. Confocal microscopy, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry further confirmed that Zbp1 is specifically upregulated in macrophages and microglia. Using Zbp1-knockout mice and flow cytometry, it is found that knockout of Zbp1 enhanced lymphocyte infiltration and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, modulating the immune microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) during AC infection. Mechanistically, it is revealed that in macrophage Zbp1 directly binds to receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) to promote its phosphorylation, subsequently facilitating the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl). The activated Zbp1-pRIP3-pMlkl axis leads to necroptosis and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1α, CXCL9, CXCL10 in macrophages, which recruits and activates immune cells. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of angiostrongyliasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The development of new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic potential of microvascular endothelium. A specific feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the post-COVID syndrome that is characterised by long-term impairment of various organs and systems. The immune pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis requires special attention due to their baseline pro-inflammatory status. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of novel coronavirus infection on the risk of chronic systemic hyper-inflammation and low-grade systemic inflammation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Two main groups consisted of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had survived COVID-19 (mild form) 3 months ago, or at earlier terms, including the subjects with post-COVID symptoms and those free of these symptoms. The comparison group included patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without a history of COVID-19. The control group was presented by healthy blood donors. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFá), D-dimers, troponin I, cortisol, and endothelin I (ET-I) were measured in patients’ plasma by immunoassay technique. On the basis of these markers, we calculated integral indices of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) – the levels of reactivity (RL), and chronic systemic hyper-inflammation (ChSI). Low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) was diagnosed in absence of ChSI, but in cases of simultaneous increase of D-dimer levels 250 ng/ml and ET-I levels 90 pg/ml in the patient. 
The most prevalent symptoms of post-COVID in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were tachycardia, arthralgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, which correspond to the population-wide data. By all empirical parameters, the groups of tuberculosis patients were comparable to each other (p 0.05) and significantly differed from control group. However, evaluation of integral indexes is more crucial for assessing the ‘systemic’ origin of the process. Thus, 23-50% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed subcritical SIR (RL = 1-2), being a feature of ChSI in 7.1-13.6% of cases (both in COVID-19 reconvalescents and non-COVID-19 patients). Meanwhile, all patient groups did not show significant difference in the frequency of LGSI and endothelial dysfunction (p 0.05). However, there was a trend towards an increase of these scores in the following sequence: tuberculosis without COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 + post-COVID syndrome. 
Most patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are not characterized by the development of chronic systemic hyperinflammation. LGSI is the most probable feature of general pathology in tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis infection sufficiently contributes to the development of LGSI, since the frequency and severity of LGSI and its individual manifestations are independent on the new coronavirus infection and signs of post-COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients across different stages of Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression and stimulated ex vivo to develop biomarkers for predicting PD progression. Method PBMCs obtained at one time‐point from patients with moderate stage PD (>5 years after diagnosis) (n = 30), early stage PD (<5 years after diagnosis) (n = 27), prodromal PD (rapid‐eye‐movement sleep behavior disorder patients) (n = 14), and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 9) were isolated from whole blood and cryopreserved. Samples were thawed, then pan‐monocytes and T‐cell populations were isolated from PBMCs and subjected to treatment with vehicle or IFN‐γ. An additional treatment condition with CD3/28 magnetic beads was included for T‐cells. Cultured media was kept for evaluation of cell‐type specific cytokine release, and live cells were analyzed with flow cytometry for markers of immune activation, mitochondrial and lysosomal function, and LRRK2 expression and activity. Result In classical, intermediate, and non‐classical monocytes from HCs, expression of pRab10, LRRK2, and MHC‐II increases after treatment with ex vivo IFN‐γ stimulation. In CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cells from HCs, IFN‐γ and CD3/28 bead treatment caused increased expression of pRab10. CD3/28 magnetic beads, but not IFN‐γ, caused increased expression of CD137 and LRRK2, while also leading to reduced levels of acidified lysosomes. Studies are currently underway to analyze cells from PD and prodromal patients and evaluate cell‐type specific cytokine release in the conditioned media. Conclusion We have applied a validated ex vivo stimulation protocol using PBMCs from PD patients across different stages of disease to measure immune cell activation and cell‐type specific cytokine release. If our hypothesis is correct, we expect that immune cell subsets from PD patients will display a signature of dysregulated immune response to stimulation. Furthermore, we expect that prodromal PD patients will exhibit dysregulated peripheral immune responses compared to controls, including altered mitochondrial and lysosomal function and cytokine release.">

Using PBMC-derived induced microglia-like cells (piMGLCs) in a scalable assay, we screened 489 CNS-penetrant compounds for modulation of microglial phagocytosis of human synaptosomes in a validated assay for microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. Compounds from the library that reduced phagocytosis by ≥2 standard deviations across the library without cytotoxicity were validated in secondary screens, with 28 of them further confirmed to reduce phagocytosis by 50% or more. Image-based morphological measurements were calculated to measure the degree of ramified vs. amoeboid morphotype as an indicator of activation state. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling indicated divergent effects on cell signaling, metabolism, activation, and actin dynamics across confirmed compounds. In particular, multiple CNS-penetrant small molecules with prior FDA approval or demonstration of safety in vivo demonstrated modulatory effects on microglia. These potential disease-modifying agents represent high-priority candidates for repositioning studies in neurodevelopmental, neuroinflammatory, or neurodegenerative disorders.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of Lassa fever has not yet been fully deciphered, particularly as concerns the mechanisms determining whether acute infection is controlled or leads to catastrophic illness and death. Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus (LASV) infection reproducing the different outcomes of the disease, we performed histological and transcriptomic studies to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity, with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever. By contrast, the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response, is associated with a fatal outcome. These results provide new insight into early viral dynamics and the host response to LASV infection according to disease outcome.">

        <tr id="Rabies virus (RABV) proteins play dual roles during the infection of complex neural tissue, the generation and spread of new virions and the active inhibition of cellular innate immune pathways, both contributing to rabies’ lethality. While spatially-distinct RABV protein residues specializing in virus-centric and immune-inhibitory functions have been identified, how these dual functions interact to shape infection outcomes across diverse types of host brain cells is unknown. To “unmask” and study how innate immune inhibition affects the transcriptional regulation of the human and viral genome with cellular resolution, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of co-cultured human brain cell types, comparing infection dynamics of a wild-type RABV isolate virus to a mutant virus in which six critical point mutations in the phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M) RABV proteins selectively neuter antagonism of interferon- and NF-κB- dependent cellular responses. Our analysis reveals that RABV gene expression is shaped by host cell type and that wild-type RABV infection induces small-scale, cell-type conserved transcriptional programs that may support infection by hijacking transcriptional feedback systems that control pro-viral host cell factors while minimizing anti-viral responses. In contrast to accepted models, disinhibited innate immune signaling increases RABV transcriptional output across infected cell types. Most strikingly, we discovered a subpopulation of astrocytes that supports an average of 6-fold higher viral mRNA expression through a massive host cell transcriptional change involving ∼38% of astrocyte expressed genes. Our analysis suggests that these astrocytes we term “pro-viral” are a rare subtype present in the human brain and are primed to play a protective role during viral infection in concert with interferon-sensitive microglia recalcitrant to infection.">

So far, HERVs have been studied in the context of extensive immunopathogenic, neuropathogenic and even oncogenic effects within their host. In particular, in our paper, we elaborate on the aspects related to the possible correlation of transposable HERV elements’ activation and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s presence in cells of COVID-19 patients or upon COVID-19 vaccination with implications for natural and adaptive immunity. In particular, the release of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 occurs in such cases and plays a notable role in sustaining chronic inflammation. Moreover, well-known interindividual variations of HERVs might partially account for the interpersonal variability of COVID-19 symptoms or unwanted events post-vaccination. Accordingly, further studies are required to clarify the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s role in triggering HERVs.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex and multifaceted process that involves dynamic interactions among various cellular and molecular components. This sophisticated interplay supports both environmental adaptability and system resilience in the central nervous system (CNS) but may be disrupted during neuroinflammation. In this article, we first characterize the key players in neuroimmune interactions, including microglia, astrocytes, neurons, immune cells, and essential signaling molecules such as cytokines, neurotransmitters, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and neurotrophic factors. Under homeostatic conditions, these elements promote cellular cooperation and stability, whereas in neuroinflammatory states, they drive adaptive responses that may become pathological if dysregulated. We examine how neuroimmune interactions, mediated through these cellular actors and signaling pathways, create complex networks that regulate CNS functionality and respond to injury or inflammation. To further elucidate these dynamics, we provide insights using a multilayer network (MLN) approach, highlighting the interconnected nature of neuroimmune interactions under both inflammatory and homeostatic conditions. This perspective aims to enhance our understanding of neuroimmune communication and the mechanisms underlying shifts from homeostasis to neuroinflammation. Applying an MLN approach offers a more integrative view of CNS resilience and adaptability, helping to clarify inflammatory processes and identify novel intervention points within the layered landscape of neuroinflammatory responses.">

In this study, involving 394 individuals, we found direct linkage of branches spanning human biological functions often not studied in conjunction, using clinical data, gut microbial abundances, blood immune cell repertoires, blood transcriptomic and blood T cell receptor data. Contrary to current paradigms, we demonstrate that immunotypes and enterotypes are orthogonal, likely fulfilling distinct roles in maintaining homeostasis, only bridged via the blood transcriptome. We also identified two distinct inflammatory profiles: the first driven by interferon signalling and the other characterised by non-viral, NF-kB and IL-6 markers. Lastly, we present compelling data showing strong associations of the Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae bacteria with a healthy immunotype and transcriptomic pattern, highlighting their potential role in immune health.

        <tr id="The microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is required for diverse microglia responses in neurodegeneration, including immunometabolic plasticity, phagocytosis, and survival. We previously identified that patient iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Mg) harboring the Alzheimer's disease (AD) TREM2R47H hypomorph display several functional deficits linked to metabolism. To investigate whether these deficits are associated with disruptions in metabolite signaling, we generated common variant, TREM2R47H and TREM2-/- variant human iPS-Mg. We assessed the ability of supplementation with citrate or succinate, key metabolites and cell cycle breaking points upon microglia activation, to overcome these functional deficits with potential impact on neurons. Succinate supplementation was more effective than citrate at overcoming mitochondrial deficits in OXPHOS and did not promote a glycolytic switch. Citrate enhanced the lipid content of TREM2R47H iPS-Mg and was more effective at overcoming Αβ phagocytic deficits, whereas succinate increased lipid content and phagocytic capacity in TREM2-/- iPS-Mg. Microglia cytokine secretion upon pro-inflammatory activation was moderately affected by citrate or succinate showing a condition-dependent increasing trend. Neither metabolite altered basal levels of soluble TREM2 shedding. In addition, neither citrate nor succinate enhanced glycolysis; instead, drove their effects through oxidative phosphorylation. IPS-neurons exposed to conditioned medium from TREM2 variant iPS-Mg showed changes in oxidative phosphorylation, which could be ameliorated when iPS-Mg were first treated with citrate or succinate. Our data point to discrete pathway linkage between microglial metabolism and functional outcomes with implications for AD pathogenesis and treatments.">

        <tr id="Introduction Chronic immune activation is a hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that significantly impacts disease pathogenesis. However, in-depth studies characterizing the immunological landscape of the ectocervix during chronic HIV infection remain scarce despite the importance of this tissue site for HIV transmission. Methods Ectocervical tissue samples were obtained from antiretroviral-naïve HIV-seropositive and -seronegative Kenyan female sex workers. These samples were assessed by spatial transcriptomics and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. We further performed multi-epitope ligand cartography (MELC) using an in situ staining panel that included 17 markers of primarily T cell–mediated immune responses. Results Spatial transcriptomics revealed tissue-wide immune activation encompassing immune responses associated with chronic HIV infection. First, both the epithelial and submucosal compartments showed diverse but significant upregulation of humoral immune responses, as indicated by the expression of several antibody-related genes. Second, an antiviral state–associated cellular immunity was also observed in the HIV-seropositive group, characterized by upregulation of genes involved in interferon signaling across the mucosal tissue and a more spatially restricted mucosal expression of genes related to T cell activity and effector functions relative to the HIV-seronegative group. Additionally, HIV associated structural alterations were evident within both compartments. Downregulated genes across the epithelium were mainly linked to epithelial integrity, with the outer layer involved in terminal differentiation and the inner layer associated with epithelial structure. MELC analysis further revealed a significantly increased ectocervical leukocyte population in HIV-seropositive participants, primarily driven by an increase in CD8+ T cells while the CD4+ T cell population remained stable. Consistent with our spatial transcriptomics data, T cells from HIV-seropositive participants showed an increased effector phenotype, defined by elevated expression of various granzymes. Conclusion By combining spatial transcriptomics and MELC, we identified significant HIV-associated cervical immune activity driven by induction of both T and B cell activity, together with a general antiviral state characterized by sustained interferon induction. These findings underscore that chronic HIV infection is associated with an altered ectocervical mucosal immune landscape years after primary infection. This sheds light on HIV pathogenesis at distant local sites and complements current knowledge on HIV-associated systemic immune activation.">

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

Using PBMC from a cohort of human subjects collected prior to 2019, we assessed the abundance and phenotype of these CD4 T cells using cytokine Elispot assays. Unexpectedly, cytotoxic potential was uniquely enriched amongst HKU1-reactive CD4 T cells, as measured by quantification of granzyme producing cells. Also, although dramatic losses in HCoV-specific CD4 T cells abundance for OC43, NL63 and 229E-specific cells were observed in older subjects relative to younger adults, HKU1-reactive cells exhibited minimal age-dependent differences in this phenotype.">

        <tr id="Mitochondrial dysfunction and macrophage dysregulation are well recognized as significant contributors to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms connecting these two factors remain poorly understood. This study hypothesizes that low but chronic interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) plays a critical role in these processes. To explore this, we utilized ARE-Del mice, a model characterized by sustained low-level IFN-γ expression and lupus nephritis (LN)-like symptoms. Age- and tissue-dependent gene expression analyses in ARE-Del mice revealed significant suppression of mitochondrial complex I components and activities, particularly in the kidneys. The genotype-dependent suppression of mitochondrial complex I indicates early disruption, which leads to macrophage dysfunction. Notably, remission restored gene expression of mitochondrial complex I and macrophage dysfunction in isolated renal macrophages from NZB/W lupus-prone mice. These findings suggest that chronic low-level IFN-γ disrupts mitochondrial complex I activity in macrophages, highlighting its role in the early pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like lupus nephritis. This provides new insights into the molecular interactions underlying autoimmune pathogenesis and suggests potential targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), the pathophysiology of which remains unclear and for which there is no definitive cure. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are immunomodulatory molecules expressed in various tissues, including the CNS. Here, we investigated whether the cathelicidin-related AMP (CRAMP) modulated the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. We showed that, at early stage, CNS-recruited neutrophils produced neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) rich in CRAMP that was required for EAE initiation. NET-associated CRAMP stimulated IL-6 production by dendritic cells via the cGAS/STING pathway, thereby promoting encephalitogenic Th17 response. However, at a later disease stage, neurons also expressed CRAMP that reduced EAE severity. Camp knockdown in neurons led to disease exacerbation, while local injection of CRAMP1-39 at the peak of EAE promoted disease remission. In vitro, CRAMP1-39 regulated the activation of microglia and astrocytes through the formyl peptide receptor (FPR)2. Finally, administration of butyrate, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, stimulated the expression of neural CRAMP via the free fatty acids receptors (FFAR)2/3, and prevented EAE. This study shows that CRAMP produced by different cell types have opposing effects on neuroinflammation, offering therapeutic opportunities for MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="The blood–brain barrier (BBB) serves as an interface between the bloodstream and the central nervous system. It limits the movement of molecules and immune cells, regulates the entry of nutrients, and removes waste products from the brain. The dysfunction of the BBB has been identified in Parkinson’s disease (PD) but the role of the BBB and endothelial cells (ECs) has not been well studied. LRRK2 G2019S mutation is the most common PD causing mutation with similar pathophysiology than in sporadic cases. How the mutation affects EC function has not been investigated previously in patient cells. In the study, we used iPSC-derived ECs from PD patients with the LRRK2 mutation as well as cells from healthy individuals. We report that PD patients’ ECs have higher levels of α-synuclein and an decreased maximal and ATP-linked respiration and altered response to inflammatory exposure, especially to TNFα. In addition, transcriptomic analysis showed upregulation of fatty-acid-synthesis-related pathways in PD patients’ ECs and the downregulation of lncRNA MEG3, both of which have been associated with PD. Altogether, PD patients’ ECs manifest some of the PD-related hallmarks and are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.">

However, the focus on immediate effects was assumed as the tip of iceberg due to the symptoms following acute infection, which was defined as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). Gut microbiota alterations even after disease resolution and the gastrointestinal symptoms are the key features of PACS. Gut microbiota and derived metabolites disorders may play a crucial role in inflammatory and immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection through the gut-lung axis. Diet is one of the modifiable factors closely related to gut microbiota and COVID-19. In this review, we described the reciprocal crosstalk between gut and lung, highlighting the participation of diet and gut microbiota in and after COVID-19 by destroying the gut barrier, perturbing the metabolism and regulating the immune system. Therefore, bolstering beneficial species by dietary supplements, probiotics or prebiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be a novel avenue for COVID-19 and PACS prevention. This review provides a better understanding of the association between gut microbiota and the long-term consequences of COVID-19, which indicates modulating gut dysbiosis may be a potentiality for addressing this multifaceted condition.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) rarely infects the brain following infection of adult individuals. However, the virus readily infects the brain during congenital HCMV (cHCMV) infection, frequently causing severe neurodevelopmental and neurological sequelae. Interestingly, although the incidence of cHCMV infection is 0.5–1%, the proportion of congenitally infected individuals in which the virus manages to gain access to the brain is unknown. In this study, we used infection of mice with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), the most commonly used experimental system for modeling HCMV disease in humans, to determine the impact of age on the susceptibility of the brain to cytomegalovirus infection and infection-mediated neuroinflammation. We demonstrate that infection of mice during various stages of neonatal development can lead to CMV neuroinvasion and inflammation. In contrast, MCMV infection does not result in MCMV neuroinvasion and neuroinflammation in weanling and adult mice. The obtained results establish a basis for elucidating the mechanisms of CMV neuroinvasion and the deleterious inflammatory response during ontogeny.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito‐borne alphavirus that is primarily known for causing severe joint and muscle symptoms, but its pathological effects have extended beyond these tissues. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive proteomic analysis across various organs in rodent and nonhuman primate models to investigate CHIKV's impact on organs beyond joints and muscles and to identify key host factors involved in its pathogenesis. Our findings reveal significant species‐specific similarities and differences in immune responses and metabolic regulation, with proteins like Interferon‐Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) and Retinoic Acid‐Inducible Gene I (RIG‐I) playing crucial roles in the anti‐CHIKV defense. We observed upregulated and downregulated metabolic status in CHIKV‐infected rhesus monkeys and mice, respectively. Additionally, we identified host factors such as S100 Calcium‐Binding Protein A8/A9 (S100A8/A9), Voltage‐Dependent Anion Channel 1/2 (VDAC1/2), Complement Component 3 (C3), Apoptosis‐Inducing Factor Mitochondria‐Associated 1 (AIFM1), Endothelial Cell‐Specific Chemotaxis Regulator (ECSCR), and Kininogen 1 (KNG1) that may contribute to CHIKV‐induced inflammation and hemorrhage. These insights put emphases on the importance of understanding CHIKV's impact on organs beyond joints and muscles, providing potential therapeutic targets and enhancing our understanding of CHIKV pathogenesis. This research underscores the need for appropriate animal models in CHIKV studies and informs the development of targeted therapies to address its systemic effects.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction This review delves into the intricate relationship between NLR inflammasomes, particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the immune‐mediated neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). While the precise etiology of MS remains elusive, compelling research underscores the pivotal role of the immune response in disease progression. Notably, recent investigations highlight the significant involvement of NLRP3 inflammasomes in various autoimmune diseases, prompting an in‐depth exploration of their impact on MS. Method The review focuses on elucidating the activation mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasomes within microglia/macrophages (MG/MФ), examining how this activation promotes an inflammatory response that exacerbates neuronal damage in MS. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature and research findings forms the basis for understanding the intricate interplay between NLRP3 inflammasomes and MS pathogenesis. Results Synthesizing current research, the review provides insight into the pivotal role played by NLR inflammasomes, specifically NLRP3, in MS. Emphasis is placed on the inflammatory response orchestrated by activated MG/MФ, elucidating the cascade that perpetuates neuronal damage in the disease. Conclusions This review concludes by consolidating key findings and offering a nuanced perspective on the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in MS pathogenesis. The detailed exploration of the activation process within MG/MФ provides a foundation for understanding the disease's underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the review sets the stage for potential therapeutic strategies targeting NLRP3 inflammasomes in the pursuit of MS treatment.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease has challenged the global medical community. Its progression led to severe health and life consequences, resulting in prolonged complications following the onset of the acute phase of the disease. The immune system was the first to respond to the viral infection entering the body. Pulmonary, neurological, psychiatric, and cardiovascular disorders became the initial stage in the pathological process. Elderly patients commonly experience chronic pain and inflammation as the main complaints associated with the development of this infectious disease; it is a daily struggle for them. Unfortunately, mental disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, myalgias, and arthralgias cause severe changes in the daily lives of senior people. Evaluating the ability of immune-competent cells, which are the main cells of the immune system, has become an essential source of information for doctors. T-lymphocytes are responsible for cellular immune responses and immunologically monitor the antigenic homeostasis in the body. Patients with COVID-19 displayed fewer T cells than the control group, and the decrease in T cells was more significant than in B cells and NK cells. Lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients may suggest the hyperactivation and migration of lymphocytes in the lungs and the apoptosis and suppression of T lymphocytes. Studies have indicated that COVID-19 is linked to an intensified inflammatory response, leading to a “cytokine storm” that may result in multisystem severe organ damage. Cytokine dysregulation is vital in weakening the immune system in older age. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines mark aging, reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines, and decreased T-cell-mediated function. Older people are also at high risk for viral illnesses, including COVID-19, as well as mental health disorders like cognitive impairments and PTSD. The findings suggest that alterations in the examined biomarkers associated with disease severity can be utilized to monitor the seriousness of the disease and forecast the duration of rehabilitation. Artificial intelligence made it possible to process and analyze data from the studies of patients with COVID-19 to predict accelerated aging.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in children worldwide. Despite this, no studies have employed proteomics to characterize host immune responses to severe pediatric vLRTI in both the lower airway and systemic circulation. To address this gap, gain insights into vLRTI pathophysiology, and test a novel diagnostic approach, we assayed 1,305 proteins in tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma from 62 critically ill children using SomaScan. We performed differential expression (DE) and pathway analyses comparing vLRTI (n = 40) to controls with non-infectious acute respiratory failure (n = 22), developed a diagnostic classifier using LASSO regression, and analyzed matched TA and plasma samples. We further investigated the impact of viral load and bacterial coinfection on the proteome. The TA signature of vLRTI was characterized by 200 DE proteins (Padj <0.05) with upregulation of interferons and T cell responses and downregulation of inflammation-modulating proteins including FABP and MIP-5. A nine-protein TA classifier achieved an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90–1.00) for identifying vLRTI. In plasma, the host response to vLRTI was more muted with 56 DE proteins. Correlation between TA and plasma was limited, although ISG15 was elevated in both compartments. In bacterial coinfection, we observed increases in the TNF-stimulated protein TSG-6, as well as CRP, and interferon-related proteins. Viral load correlated positively with interferon signaling and negatively with neutrophil-activation pathways. Taken together, our study provides fresh insights into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI and identifies novel protein biomarkers with diagnostic potential. IMPORTANCE We describe the first proteomic profiling of the lower airway and blood in critically ill children with severe viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI). From tracheal aspirate (TA), we defined a proteomic signature of vLRTI characterized by increased expression of interferon signaling proteins and decreased expression of proteins involved in immune modulation including FABP and MIP-5. Using machine learning, we developed a parsimonious diagnostic classifier that distinguished vLRTI from non-infectious respiratory failure with high accuracy. Comparative analysis of paired TA and plasma specimens demonstrated limited concordance, although the interferon-stimulated protein ISG15 was significantly upregulated with vLRTI in both compartments. We further identified TSG-6 and CRP as airway biomarkers of bacterial-viral coinfection, and viral load analyses demonstrated a positive correlation with interferon-related protein expression and a negative correlation with the expression of neutrophil activation proteins. Taken together, our study provides new insights into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI.">

However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which microglia regulate the neuroinflammatory response to spinal cord injury, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing dataset analysis, focusing on changes in microglial subpopulations. We found that the MG1 subpopulation emerged in the acute/subacute phase of spinal cord injury and expressed genes related to cell pyroptosis, sphingomyelin metabolism, and neuroinflammation at high levels. Subsequently, we established a mouse model of contusive injury and performed intrathecal injection of siRNA and molecular inhibitors to validate the role of ceramide synthase 5 in the neuroinflammatory responses and pyroptosis after spinal cord injury. Finally, we established a PC12-BV2 cell co-culture system and found that ceramide synthase 5 and pyroptosis-associated proteins were highly expressed to induce the apoptosis of neuron cells. Inhibiting ceramide synthase 5 expression in a mouse model of spinal cord injury effectively reduced pyroptosis. Furthermore, ceramide synthase 5-induced pyroptosis was dependent on activation of the NLRP3 signaling pathway. Inhibiting ceramide synthase 5 expression in microglia in vivo reduced neuronal apoptosis and promoted recovery of neurological function. Pla2g7 formed a "bridge" between sphingolipid metabolism and ceramide synthase 5-mediated cell death by inhibiting the NLRP3 signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that inhibiting ceramide synthase 5 expression in microglia after spinal cord injury effectively suppressed microglial pyroptosis mediated by NLRP3, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects.">

        <tr id="Human genetics studies lent firm evidence that microglia are key to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis over a decade ago following the identification of AD-associated genes that are expressed in a microglia-specific manner. However, while alterations in microglial morphology and gene expression are observed in human postmortem brain tissue, the mechanisms by which microglia drive and contribute to AD pathology remain ill-defined. Numerous mouse models have been developed to facilitate the disambiguation of the biological mechanisms underlying AD, incorporating amyloidosis, phosphorylated tau, or both. Over time, the use of multiple technologies including bulk tissue and single cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics have shed light on the heterogeneity of microglial phenotypes and molecular patterns altered in AD mouse models. Each of these 'omics technologies provide unique information and biological insight. Here, we review the literature on the approaches and findings of these methods and provide a synthesis of the knowledge generated by applying these technologies to mouse models of AD.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a blanket term that describes the body's complex inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS). It encompasses a phenotype shift to a proinflammatory state, the release of cytokines, the recruitment of peripheral immune cells, and a wide variety of other processes. Neuroinflammation has been implicated in nearly every major CNS disease ranging from Alzheimer's disease to brain cancer. Understanding and modeling neuroinflammation is critical for the identification of novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of CNS diseases. Unfortunately, the translation of findings from non-human models has left much to be desired. This review systematically discusses the role of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived glia and supporting cells within the CNS, including astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, pericytes, and endothelial cells, to describe the state of the field and hope for future discoveries. hPSC-derived cells offer an expanded potential to study the pathobiology of neuroinflammation and immunomodulatory cascades that impact disease progression. While much progress has been made in the development of models, there is much left to explore in the application of these models to understand the complex inflammatory response in the CNS.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Monocyte‐derived macrophages and microglia initially adopt an anti‐inflammatory phenotype following stroke but later transition to a pro‐inflammatory state. The mechanisms underlying this phenotypic shift remain unclear. This study investigates the activation dynamics of molecular signaling pathways in macrophages and microglia after stroke. Methods We utilized publicly available single‐cell RNA sequencing datasets to examine the activation dynamics of molecular signaling pathways alongside the pro‐inflammatory phenotype of macrophages and microglia. Male C57BL/6 mice underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), with the STING inhibitor H151 administered to tMCAO mice. Neurobehavioral performance was assessed using rotarod, foot fault, novel object recognition, and water maze tests at 5‐, 7‐, 10‐, and 14‐days post‐stroke. Primary microglia and bone marrow‐derived macrophages were cultured for in vitro experiments. Results Single‐cell sequencing data indicated that the activation of STING and subsequent type I interferon signaling drove the phenotypic shift of microglia and macrophages toward a pro‐inflammatory state in the stroke lesion. Immunostaining demonstrated that the emergence of pro‐inflammatory microglia and macrophages aligned with the activation time course of STING and type I interferon signaling. Continuous phagocytosis by macrophages and microglia led to STING activation, which triggered type I interferon signaling and promoted the phenotypic shift. Inhibition of STING signaling prevented this transition, reduced neuroinflammation, and conferred protection against ischemic stroke. Conclusion These findings elucidated the critical role of STING‐mediated type I interferon signaling in driving post‐stroke neuroinflammation and underscored the potential of STING inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for alleviating neuroinflammatory responses following stroke.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical for immunosurveillance yet become dysfunctional in contexts such as chronic stimulation by viral infections or cancer. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less well characterized, which limits therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, which have remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex. Results Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically improved the quality of life for people living with HIV (PLWH). However, over 4 million PLWH are over the age of fifty and experience accompanying HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). To understand how HIV impacts the central nervous system, a reliable and feasible model of HIV is necessary. Previously, a novel biological system using chimeric HIV (EcoHIV) inoculation was developed in a rat model to investigate neurocognitive impairments and synaptic dysfunction. Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains in clarifying EcoHIV's neuroanatomical distribution, particularly its differential expression in various cell types in the brain. In the current study, EcoHIV with mScarlet fluorescence labeling was modified and retro-orbitally injected into Tmem119-EGFP knock-in mice (which express enhanced green fluorescence protein primarily in microglia) to determine if microglia are the major cell type responsible for viral expression and reservoirs of HIV in the brain. The current data show that: (1) in vitro, EcoHIV-mScarlet fluorescence signals were predominantly localized in microglia-like cells among primary rodent brain cells; (2) in vivo, injection of EcoHIV-mScarlet into Tmem119-EGFP mice induced significant HIV expression in the mouse brain. The co-localization of mScarlet and EGFP signals suggests that microglia are the main cell type harboring HIV in the brain. Overall, EcoHIV in rodents offers a valuable biological system to study microglial alterations, viral reservoirs in the brain, and the neurological mechanisms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.">

        <tr id="Disease-associated microglia (DAM) are observed in neurodegenerative diseases, demyelinating disorders, and aging. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and evolutionary trajectory of DAM during the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain unclear. Using a mouse model of ALS that expresses a human SOD1 gene mutation, we found that the microglia subtype DAM begins to appear following motor neuron degeneration, primarily in the brain stem and spinal cord. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNAscope in situ hybridization, and flow cytometry, we found that DAM increased in number as the disease progressed, reaching their peak in the late disease stage. DAM responded to disease progression in both SOD1G93A mice and sporadic ALS and C9orf72-mutated patients. Motor neuron loss in SOD1G93A mice exhibited 2 accelerated phases: P90 to P110 (early stage) and P130 to P150 (late stage). Some markers were synchronized with the accelerated phase of motor neuron loss, suggesting that these proteins may be particularly responsive to disease progression. Through pseudotime trajectory analysis, we tracked the dynamic transition of homeostatic microglia into DAM and cluster 6 microglia. Interestingly, we used the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 to deplete microglia in SOD1G93A mice and observed that DAM survival is independent of CSF1R. An in vitro phagocytosis assay directly confirmed that DAM could phagocytose more beads than other microglia subtypes. These findings reveal that the induction of the DAM phenotype is a shared cross-species and cross-subtype characteristic in ALS. Inducing the DAM phenotype and enhancing its function during the early phase of disease progression, or the time window between P130 and P150 where motor neuron loss slows, could serve as a neuroprotective strategy for ALS.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives: Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 and TIM-3 play an important role in regulating the host immune response and are proposed as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in severe cases of COVID-19. We evaluated the expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 on T cells, as well as the concentration of sPD-1 in plasma, to clarify the role of these molecules in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we analysed the expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon admission and after 7 days of hospitalisation in 770 adult patients. We also evaluated sPD-1 levels in the plasma of 145 patients at different stages of COVID-19 and of 11 control subjects. Molecules were determined using conventional flow cytometry and ELISA and the data were statistically processed. Results: We observed a significantly higher expression of PD-1 on CD4+ cells in deceased patients than in those with mild-to-moderate disease. All patients with COVID-19 exhibited a significantly higher expression of TIM-3 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to controls. After 1 week of hospitalisation, there was no significant change in PD-1 or TIM-3 expression on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells across the studied groups. sPD-1 concentrations were not significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. Plasma sPD-1 levels did not correlate with PD-1 expression on T cells, but a significant correlation was observed between CD4+ PD-1 and CD8+ PD-1. Using machine-learning algorithms, we supported our observations and confirmed immunological variables capable of predicting survival, with AUC = 0.786. Conclusions: Analysis of the immune response may be useful for monitoring and predicting the course of COVID-19 upon admission. However, it is essential to evaluate complex immune parameters in conjunction with other key clinical and laboratory indicators.">

        <tr id="Chronic liver disease (CLD) has massive systemic repercussions including major impacts on the body's immune system. Abnormalities in phenotype, function and numbers of various immune cell subsets have been established by a large number of clinical and pre-clinical studies. The loss of essential immune functions renders CLD-patients exceptionally susceptible to bacterial and viral infections and also impairs the efficacy of vaccination. Consequently, infections represent a major clinical issue causing significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Mechanistically, the immune dysfunction associated with CLD results from the increased translocation of bacteria and bacterial cues from the intestine. These trigger a signaling axis around the cytokines IFN I and IL-10 in hepatic myeloid cells, which aside from impairing the function of the myeloid cells themselves, also has notable negative impacts on the functionality of other immune cells. T cells in CLD-patients and -models are especially affected by this signaling axis and display a variety of quantitative and qualitative defects. Due to the high clinical relevance, understanding the mechanisms underlaying CED-associated immune dysfunction is of critical importance to discover and develop new therapeutic targets.">

The persistent effects of COVID-19 have become a subject of significant concern amongst the medical and scientific community. This article aims to explore the probability of a link between the COVID-19 infection and the risk of lung cancer development. First, this article reports that SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammatory response and cellular stress, potentially leading to tumorigenesis through common pathways between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer. These pathways include the JAK/STAT3 pathway which is activated after the initiation of cytokine storm following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This pathway is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and immune homeostasis. The JAK/STAT3 pathway is also hyperactivated in lung cancer which serves as a link thereof. It predisposes patients to lung cancer through myriad molecular mechanisms such as DNA damage, genomic instability, and cell cycle dysregulation. Another probable pathway to tumorigenesis is based on the possibility of an oncogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 through hijacking the p53 protein, leading to cell oxidative stress and interfering with the DNA repair mechanisms. Finally, this article highlights the overexpression of the SLC22A18 gene in lung cancer. This gene can be overexpressed by the ZEB1 transcription factor, which was found to be highly expressed during COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="Chronic stress is a major contributor to the development of major depressive disorder, one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Using a model of repeated social defeat stress in mice, we and others have reported that neuroinflammation plays a dynamic role in the development of behavioral deficits consistent with social avoidance and impaired reward responses. Animals susceptible to the model also exhibit hypomyelination in the medial prefrontal cortex, indicative of changes in the differentiation pathway of cells of the oligodendroglial lineage (OLN). We computationally confirmed the presence of immune oligodendrocytes, a population of OLN cells, which express immune markers and myelination deficits. In the current study, we report that microglia are necessary to induce expression of antigen presentation markers (and other immune markers) on oligodendroglia. We further associate the appearance of these markers with changes in the OLN and confirm that microglial changes precede OLN changes. Using co-cultures of microglia and OLN, we show that under inflammatory conditions the processes of phagocytosis and expression of MHCII are linked, suggesting potential priming for antigen presentation by OLN cells. Our findings provide insights into the nature of these OLN cells with immune capabilities, their obligatory interaction with microglia, and identify them as a potential cellular contributor to the pathological manifestations of psychosocial stress.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterised by an overwhelming immune response and high fatality. While most research has focused on its acute phase, many sepsis survivors remain immunologically weakened leaving them susceptible to serious complications from even mild infections. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged immune dysregulation remain unclear, limiting effective interventions. Here, we analysed whether sepsis induced long-term “training” in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), imprinting changes that persist in their myeloid progeny. Peripheral blood analysis of 8 sepsis survivors, 12 patients with septic shock, and 10 healthy donors revealed a significant expansion of CD38+ progenitors in survivors, with increases in megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and reduced mature neutrophil counts. This shift suggests impaired granulopoiesis, favouring immature, immunosuppressive granulocytes. Differentiated macrophages from survivors’ HSPCs exhibited impaired metabolic pathways after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, with downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis genes, indicating altered immune metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed enhanced type-I interferon (IFN) and JAK-STAT signalling in survivors’ macrophages, reflective of potentially tolerance-prone reprogramming. Finally, exposing healthy donor HSPCs to IFNβ during macrophage differentiation reduced HSPC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced a metabolic shift towards glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that sepsis induces lasting reprogramming in HSPCs leading to myeloid progeny with altered immune memory that might drive immune dysregulation in survivors. These data open avenues to explore potential targets to better manage long-term immune alterations in sepsis survivors. KEY POINTS Sepsis induces long-term alterations in HSPCs, leading to the expansion of immature progenitors and metabolic dysregulation of their progeny. Type-I IFN signalling reprograms macrophage differentiation, affecting their metabolic function and reducing cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS, whereby clinical disease activity is primarily monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).


METHODS
Given the limitations associated with implementing and acquiring novel and emerging imaging biomarkers in routine clinical practice, the discovery of biofluid biomarkers may offer a more simple and cost-effective measure that would improve accessibility, standardization, and patient care. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoparticles secreted from cells under both homeostatic and pathological states, and have been recently investigated as biomarkers in MS. The objectives of this study were to longitudinally measure levels of specific immune cell-derived EVs in MS and provide evidence that EV sub-populations may serve as biomarkers of disease activity, axonal injury, and/or clinical disability.


RESULTS
Our results demonstrate that the rate of clinical disability in MS negatively correlates with changes in circulating CD3+ EVs within the plasma. Additionally, numbers of CD4+ EVs decrease in individuals with increasing pNfL levels overtime whereby the magnitude of the pNfL increase negatively correlates with changes in plasma CD4+ and CD8+ EVs. Finally, when applying NEDA-3 criteria to define active versus stable disease, individuals with active disease had significantly elevated CD4+ and CD8+ EVs compared to stable disease.


CONCLUSION
In summary, the analysis of specific immune cell-derived EV subsets may provide a method to monitor disability accumulation, disease activity, and axonal injury in MS, while also providing insights into the pathophysiology and cellular/molecular mechanisms that influence progression.">

        <tr id="Sorting protein-related receptor containing class A repeats (SORLA) is an intracellular trafficking receptor encoded by the Alzheimer's disease (AD) gene SORL1 (sortilin-related receptor 1). Recent findings argue that altered expression in microglia may underlie the genome-wide risk of AD seen with some SORL1 gene variants, however, the functional significance of the receptor in microglia remains poorly explained. Using unbiased omics and targeted functional analyses in iPSC-based human microglia, we identified a crucial role for SORLA in sensitizing microglia to pro-inflammatory stimuli. We show that SORLA acts as a sorting factor for the pattern recognition receptor CD14, directing CD14 exposure on the cell surface and priming microglia to stimulation by pro-inflammatory factors. Loss of SORLA in gene-targeted microglia impairs proper CD14 sorting and blunts pro-inflammatory responses. Our studies indicate an important role for SORLA in shaping the inflammatory brain milieu, a biological process important to local immune responses in AD.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Microglia play significant roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Current evidence suggests microglia may function in both protective and degenerative capacities, which has received little clarity from transcriptionally-characterised phenotypes uncovered from transgenic pathologies alone. BIN1 - the second-most significant risk gene for the development of late-onset AD (LOAD) - is expressed at high levels in neurons, oligodendrocytes and microglia. We examined microglial BIN1 expression and function and previously demonstrated that BIN1 regulates proinflammatory and disease-associated activation responses in microglia in vitro and in vivo (PMID 35526014). However it's role in AD-specific pathologies is as yet unknown.


METHOD
We used a reverse-genetic approach to conditionally delete Bin1 in microglia of the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy. We used histology, biochemistry and RNAseq analyses to determine the effects of Bin1-cKO on tau pathology and microglial responses.


RESULT
Our data demonstrate that microglial BIN1 facilitates levels of pathologically phosphorylated tau (p-tau), specifically in female PS19 mice. RNAseq analysis identified cell -autonomous and non-autonomous effects for microglial BIN1 during tau pathogenesis in the PS19 model. Weighted gene co-expression analyses revealed complex networks of genes regulated by microglial gene expression during tau pathogenesis. We also identified gene networks correlated with levels of formic acid-soluble p-tau, irrespective of microglial Bin1 gene manipulation.


CONCLUSION
These gene networks offer novel insight into microglial genes involved in responses to tau pathology, and the potential impact of BIN1 as a LOAD risk gene.">

        <tr id="Red blood cells (RBCs), traditionally recognized for their role in transporting oxygen, play a pivotal role in the body's immune response by expressing TLR9 and scavenging excess host cell-free DNA. DNA capture by RBCs leads to accelerated RBC clearance and triggers inflammation. Whether RBCs can also acquire microbial DNA during infections is unknown. Murine RBCs acquire microbial DNA in vitro and bacterial-DNA-induced macrophage activation was augmented by WT but not Tlr9-deleted RBCs. In a mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis, RBC-bound bacterial DNA was elevated in WT but not in erythroid Tlr9-deleted mice. Plasma cytokine analysis in these mice revealed distinct sepsis clusters characterized by persistent hypothermia and hyperinflammation in the most severely affected subjects. RBC-Tlr9 deletion attenuated plasma and tissue IL-6 production in the most severe group. Parallel findings in human subjects confirmed that RBCs from septic patients harbored more bacterial DNA compared to healthy individuals. Further analysis through 16S sequencing of RBC-bound DNA illustrated distinct microbial communities, with RBC-bound DNA composition correlating with plasma IL-6 in patients with sepsis. Collectively, these findings unveil RBCs as overlooked reservoirs and couriers of microbial DNA, capable of influencing host inflammatory responses in sepsis.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS) is a clinical worsening or new presentation of cryptococcal disease following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. C-IRIS is primarily driven by an influx of pathological CD4+ T cells, which triggers a hyperinflammatory response. The murine model of C-IRIS is a way to study the disease in mice and understand how the immune system triggers life-threatening outcomes in patients. We previously developed a murine C-IRIS model and demonstrated that C-IRIS is triggered by pathological CD4+ T cells, particularly Th1 cells, in the brain, which triggers neurodegeneration and pulmonary dysfunction. Using this unique mouse model, we tested the therapeutic effect of a star-shaped glatiramer acetate (sGA), which is a more effective isomeric form than linear GA. Here, we observed that sGA suppresses Th1 differentiation in the lung tissues, reducing CD4+ T cell and Th1 cell count. It also reduced microglia populations in the brain. Together, these changes improved respiratory dysfunction caused by C-IRIS, lowered mortality rate, and reduced brain neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that sGA could be an effective therapeutic strategy for managing C-IRIS.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with a complex and not fully understood etiopathological background involving inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. CHI3L1 has been implicated in pathological conditions such as inflammation, injury, and neurodegeneration, and is likely to play a role in the physiological development of the CNS. CHI3L1 is primarily produced by CNS macrophages, microglia, and activated astrocytes. The CHI3L1 expression pattern in MS lesions might support the important role of astrocytes in modulating inflammatory processes in this disease. The potential applications of CHI3L1 as a biomarker in MS are multifactorial. The measurement of CHI3L1 in body fluids might find its role in the early diagnosis of MS. In further stages, the monitoring of CHI3L1 levels might provide information on disease severity and progression, enabling a better adjustment of therapeutic strategies. Importantly, CHI3L1 might potentially serve as a marker of ongoing glial activation, reflecting the dynamic response of the CNS cells to the inflammatory processes in MS. Although preliminary findings have been promising, further research is needed to validate the utility of CHI3L1 measurements in the diagnosis and prediction of the progression of MS. Additionally, comparisons with other biomarkers might be useful in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Malaria remains a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Malaysia, the emergence of Plasmodium knowlesi has led to a surge in zoonotic malaria cases and deaths in recent years. Signs of cerebral involvement have been observed in a noncomatose, fatal case of knowlesi infection, but the potential impact of this malaria species on the brain remains unexplored. To address this gap, we investigated circulating levels of brain injury, inflammation, and vascular biomarkers in a cohort of knowlesi-infected patients and controls.


METHODS
Archived plasma samples from 19 Malaysian patients with symptomatic knowlesi infection and 19 healthy, age-matched controls were analyzed. Fifty-two biomarkers of brain injury, inflammation, and vascular activation were measured. Wilcoxon tests were used to examine group differences, and biomarker profiles were explored through hierarchical clustering heatmap analysis.


RESULTS
Bonferroni-corrected analyses revealed significantly elevated brain injury biomarker levels in knowlesi-infected patients, including S100B (P < .0001), Tau (P = .0007), UCH-L1 (P < .0001), αSyn (P < .0001), Park7 (P = .0006), NRGN (P = .0022), and TDP-43 (P = .005). Compared to controls, levels were lower in the infected group for BDNF (P < .0001), CaBD (P < .0001), CNTN1 (P < .0001), NCAM-1 (P < .0001), GFAP (P = .0013), and KLK6 (P = .0126). Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct group profiles for brain injury and vascular activation biomarkers.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings highlight for the first time a potential impact of P knowlesi infection on the brain, with specific changes in cerebral injury and endothelial activation biomarker profiles. Further studies are warranted to investigate the pathophysiology and clinical significance of these altered markers, through neuroimaging and long-term neurocognitive assessments.">

Currently, there is a lack of diagnostic tools for Long COVID in clinical practice. Therefore, this study utilizes plasma proteomics and metabolomics technologies to understand the molecular profile and pathophysiological mechanisms of Long COVID, providing clinical evidence for the development of potential biomarkers. This study included three age- and gender-matched cohorts: healthy controls (n = 18), COVID-19 recovered patients (n = 17), and Long COVID patients (n = 15). The proteomics results revealed significant differences in proteins between Long COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 recovered patients, with dysregulation mainly focused on pathways such as coagulation, platelets, complement cascade reactions, GPCR cell signal transduction, and substance transport, which can participate in regulating immune responses, inflammation, and tissue vascular repair. Metabolomics results showed that Long COVID patients and COVID-19 recovered patients have similar metabolic disorders, mainly involving dysregulation in lipid metabolites and fatty acid metabolism, such as glycerophospholipids, sphingolipid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism processes. In summary, our study results indicate significant protein dysregulation and metabolic abnormalities in the plasma of Long COVID patients, leading to coagulation dysfunction, impaired energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation, which are more pronounced than in COVID-19 recovered patients.">

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a porcine neurotropic alphaherpesvirus that infects peripheral tissues of its host, spreads into the nervous system, and establishes a life-long latency in neuronal cells. During productive infection, PRV replicates rapidly and causes pseudorabies or Aujeszky's disease. Reactivation from latent infection in the nervous system may lead to anterograde axonal transport of progeny virions, leading to recurrent infection of the epithelial layer and virus spread. Dexamethasone (DEX), a member of the glucocorticoid family that is widely used in clinical treatment as a high-efficiency glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist, is known to trigger reactivation of alphaherpesviruses like PRV and the closely related bovine alphaherpesvirus 1. In the current study, two cell type-dependent distinct regulatory mechanisms of glucocorticoid during PRV infection are described. In neuron-like cells, DEX upregulates expression of PRV IE180 and promotes viral productive infection. In addition, we found that GR activates the IE180 promoter by binding multiple GR response elements. The amino acids A465, P631, and I634 in GR were found to be critical for IE180 promoter activation. The impact of DEX on PRV productive infection in epithelial cells was also investigated. Interestingly, DEX was found to downregulate IE180 expression and suppress PRV infection in epithelial cells. Mechanistically, in epithelial cells, activation of the IE180 promoter by the VP16/Oct-1 (octamer-binding transcription factor 1) complex was suppressed by DEX-mediated degradation of Oct-1 in epithelial cells. In summary, our work reveals two distinct, cell type-dependent biological functions of glucocorticoid during PRV infection in neuron-like and epithelial cells, respectively.IMPORTANCEPseudorabies virus (PRV) can infect mucosal epithelium and the peripheral nervous system of its host, resulting in acute infection in epithelial cells and neuronal cells. In this study, we describe that glucocorticoid promotes PRV replication in neuron-like cells while it suppresses productive infection in epithelial cells through distinct regulations of the viral transactivator IE180, thereby revealing a cell type-dependent regulatory mechanism of glucocorticoid on PRV infection. Therefore, our findings provide a new perspective on the role of glucocorticoids during PRV infection.">

Highlighting their dual roles in both repair and disease progression, we uncover how these elements contribute to the intricate pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascular conditions, and CNS tumors. Novel insights into microglial priming, astrocytic cytokine networks, and meningeal lymphatics challenge the conventional paradigms of immune privilege, offering fresh perspectives on disease mechanisms.

        <tr id="Macrophages are a key cell type of the innate immune system and are involved at all steps of inflammation: (i) they present antigens to initiate inflammation, (ii) they clear up foreign bodies through phagocytosis, and (iii) they resolve inflammation by removing or deactivating mediator cells. Many subtypes of macrophages have been identified, classified by their niche and/or embryonic origin. In order to better develop therapies for conditions with macrophage dysfunction, it is crucial to decipher potential sex-differences in key physiological mediators of inflammation so that treatment efficacy can be ensured regardless of biological sex. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis approach of transcriptomics datasets for male vs. female mouse macrophages across 8 niches to characterize conserved sex-dimorphic pathways in macrophages across origins and niches. For this purpose, we leveraged new and publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets from murine macrophages, preprocessed these datasets and filtered them based on objective QC criteria, and performed differential gene expression analysis using sex as the covariate of interest. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were compared across datasets and macrophage subsets, and functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify sex-specific functional differences. Consistent with their presence on the sex chromosomes, three genes were found to be differentially expressed across all datasets (i.e. Xist, Eif2s3y, and Ddx3y). More broadly, we found that female-biased pathways across macrophage niches are more consistent than male-biased pathways, specifically relating to components of the extracellular matrix. Our findings increase our understanding of transcriptional similarities across macrophage niches and underscore the importance of including sex as a biological variable in immune-related studies. Highlights Across 17 independently transcriptomic macrophage datasets, three genes are always differentially expressed between males and females: Ddx3y, Eif2s3y, and Xist. Jaccard analysis reveals female macrophages have more stereotypical transcriptional profile than male macrophages across niches. Functional enrichment analyses show that female-biased pathways across macrophage subtypes are enriched for extracellular matrix-related genes.">

        <tr id="Abstract The immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) is a highly specialized and tightly regulated process essential for maintaining neural health and protecting against pathogens and injuries. The primary immune cells within the CNS include microglia, astrocytes, T cells, and B cells. They work together, continuously monitor the CNS environment for signs of infection, injury, or disease, and respond by phagocytosing debris, releasing cytokines, and recruiting other immune cells. In addition to providing neuroprotection, these immune responses must be carefully balanced to prevent excessive inflammation that can lead to neuronal damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated immune responses in the CNS are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wnt signaling is a crucial pathway in the CNS that regulates various cellular processes critical for brain development, function, and maintenance. Despite enhancing immune responses in the health CNS, dysregulated Wnt signaling exacerbates neuroinflammation in the neurodegenerative brains. This review summarized the role of Wnt signaling in regulating immune response under different conditions. We then examined the role of immune response in healthy brains and during the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroinflammation and highlighted challenges and limitations in current clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex and dynamic response of the central nervous system (CNS) to injury, infection, and disease. While acute neuroinflammation plays a protective role by facilitating pathogen clearance and tissue repair, chronic and dysregulated inflammation contributes significantly to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. This review explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and peripheral immune cells. Key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the NLRP3 inflammasome, are discussed alongside emerging regulators such as non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications, and the gut-brain axis. The therapeutic landscape is evolving, with traditional anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs and corticosteroids offering limited efficacy in chronic conditions. Immunomodulators, gene and RNA-based therapeutics, and stem cell methods have all shown promise for more specific and effective interventions. Additionally, the modulation of metabolic states and gut microbiota has emerged as a novel strategy to regulate neuroinflammation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinically viable therapies. Future studies should concentrate on integrated, interdisciplinary methods to reduce chronic neuroinflammation and slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, providing opportunities for revolutionary advances in CNS therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
While compelling evidence highlights the importance of myeloid cells in the etiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the relevance of immunometabolism still requires further exploration. Our analysis integrating AD genetics and myeloid cell genomics shows that lower levels of LACTB expression in myeloid cells is protective against AD, a finding supported by proteomics studies. As a mitochondrial active-site serine protein, LACTB has implications for mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics. LACTB levels are also linked to succinyl-carnitine levels, a metabolite predicted to be protective for AD risk. Furthermore, LACTB has been associated with tumorigenesis and obesity, suggesting a potential role in cell dynamics and lipid metabolism, although its function remains elusive.


METHOD
Human immortalized THP-1 cells monocytes were differentiated into macrophages and treated with small-interfering RNA to knock-down LACTB (KD) expression. CRISPR-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) were generated to knock-out (KO) LACTB and differentiated into microglia cells (iMGL). Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses were outsourced with collected samples, and functional assays evaluating how LACTB alters myeloid cell functions were performed.


RESULT
Our studies revealed an upregulation of LACTB expression upon differentiation (in iMGLs compared to iPSCs, and in THP-1 macrophages compared to monocytes) and LPS stimulation. Downregulation of LACTB in THP-1s and iMGLs resulted in elevated succinyl-carnitine levels, and THP-1 LACTB KD cells showed an increase in histone succinylation levels, which might indicate epigenetic modulation. We also detected a reduction in nascent protein synthesis levels in our LACTB KD and KO models. Additionally, lipidomics showed a decrease in acylglycerides, and an increase in cholesterol efflux was observed in THP-1 LACTB KD cells.


CONCLUSION
LACTB potentially modulates myeloid cell function by modifying protein synthesis and lipid metabolism. Future directions include a novel xenotransplantation model involving the direct introduction of human microglia precursor cells into the mouse brain to study the effects of LACTB on microglia in-vivo and in the context of disease using 5xFAD mice. The distinct identity of LACTB as an enzyme, coupled with its protective phenotype upon reduced expression and the potential of succinyl carnitine as a biomarker, makes it a promising therapeutic target in AD.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, is a chronic inflammatory disease. Although typically associated with inflammation of the lungs and other peripheral tissues, increasing evidence has uncovered neurological consequences attributable to Mtb infection. These include deficits in memory and cognition, increased risk for neurodegenerative disease, and progressive neuropathology. Although the neurological effects of the disease, without CNS infection, have been characterized, the mechanism of neurotoxicity is unknown. We hypothesized that alterations to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) allows peripheral immune cells to enter the brain, initiating a neuroinflammatory response. To test this hypothesis, guinea pigs were exposed by aerosol to a laboratory and a clinical Mtb strain for 15 days. Following Mtb infection, proteins critical to BBB function, including claudin V and collagen IV, are modulated without evidence of bacterial dissemination to the brain. This is correlated with increased contact of astrocytic processes to vessels in the brain, as well as increased expression of the water channel protein aquaporin 4 (AQP4) on endfeet. Upon further investigation, we discovered the potential role of glial reactivity, which is increased following infection with both bacterial strains, in the progression of BBB changes and, ultimately, the permeability of peripheral immune cells into the brain. Through these data, we have obtained a preliminary understanding of the mechanisms of cellular stress in the brain following pulmonary Mtb infection which should be further investigated in future studies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Abnormal brain inflammation is an important feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Central nervous system (CNS) inflammation is highly related to immune cell activation. Homeostasis of immune cell activity regulation is crucial for CNS autoimmune response. Our previous study found that the expression of immune checkpoint PD-L1/PD-1 on T cells changed along with different stages of AD patients. We assayed the other immune checkpoint molecule, CTLA-4, and its functional characteristics to characterize the changes of T cell populations of peripheral blood in AD patients.


METHOD
AD patients (n = 14) and healthy elderly (n = 16) were enrolled. White blood cells collecting from blood were labelled with fluorescent antibodies and assayed by flow cytometry. To characterize changes in specific T-cell populations and features, we used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE). The analysis results of all volunteers were pooled, aggregated, and integrated with different phenotypic and functional characteristics. Distribution patterns were delineated between AD and healthy elderly, differences were compared, and molecular features were identified for further subpopulation analysis.


RESULT
(A) In the phenotypic and functional characteristics feature distribution of T cells, the subpopulation distribution difference between AD and healthy elderly was related to the expression intensity of NCAM (Neural cell adhesion molecule, CD56). (B) Further distinguishing the T cell population with positive expression of CD56, three subpopulations were found, subpopulation A, B and C. Subpopulation A decreased in AD patients, subpopulation C increased in AD patients, and subpopulation B had no obvious difference. Prominent difference of these three subpopulations was the expression level of CTLA-4. Subpopulation A was CTLA-4HighCD56+ T cell subset; subpopulation B was CTLA-4DimCD56+ T cell subset; subpopulation C was CTLA-4MediumCD56+ T cell subset.


CONCLUSION
CD56 (NCAM) positive T cells with high expression of CTLA-4 decreased in AD patients. CTLA-4 played important role in T cell priming brake, and competed B7 ligand with CD28 to suppress T cell activation. Decrease of CTLA-4 expression on CD56+ T cells indirectly promote the immune activation. Our research indicated immune imbalance in peripheral blood of AD patients. Changes of T cell subpopulations may be biomarkers of AD, and maintaining homeostasis of immunity may be potential treatment of AD in future.">

        <tr id="Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons and persistent inflammation. Neurons are terminally differentiated cells, and lost neurons cannot be replaced since neurogenesis is restricted to only two neurogenic niches in the adult brain, whose neurogenic potential decreases with age. In this regard, the astrocytes reprogramming into neurons may represent a promising strategy for restoring the lost neurons and rebuilding neural circuits. To date, many anti-inflammatory agents have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation; however, their potential to restore neuronal loss was poorly investigated. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory effects of lactoferrin on DI-TNC1 astrocyte cell line and its ability to induce astrocyte reprogramming in a context of sustained inflammation. For this purpose, astrocytes were pre-treated with lactoferrin (4 μg/mL) for 24 h, then with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (400 ng/mL), and examined 2, 9 and 16 days from treatment. The results demonstrate that lactoferrin attenuates astrocyte reactivity by reducing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and IL-6 expression, as well as by upregulating Interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokine and NRF2 expression. Moreover, lactoferrin promotes the reprogramming of reactive astrocytes into proliferative neuroblasts by inducing the overexpression of the Sex determining region Y/SRY-box 2 (SOX2) reprogramming transcription factor. Overall, this study highlights the potential effects of lactoferrin to attenuate neuroinflammation and improve neurogenesis, suggesting a future strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain. This chronic condition has no known cure, and its progression varies greatly between individuals, eventually leading to severe cognitive impairment, loss of independence, and death. Microglia, the primary immune cells in the central nervous system that serve as the brain's first line of defense, are central to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Microglia play an important role in the response to injury and infection, as well as the regulation of amyloid-beta levels. However, when amyloid-beta accumulates, it activates an inflammatory response via microglia. While this response is initially protective, it may become chronic, contributing to the neuroinflammation that worsens Alzheimers disease pathology. In this study, I wanted to isolate and investigate the specific effects of M1 and M2 macrophages in the brains of genetically modified mice. Using CRISPR technology, we developed mouse models with selective expression of M1 macrophages without M2, M2 macrophages without M1, and models with both macrophage types. Western blot analysis quantified the levels of amyloid-beta in these mice, revealing how microglial activity influences Alzheimer's disease progression. Our findings show that M1 macrophages primarily regulate amyloid-beta through inflammatory processes, which may increase amyloid-beta production, whereas M2 macrophages are essential for amyloid-beta clearance.

Microglia have the ability to utilize lipids, such as fatty acids, as energy sources, but also alterations in lipids can impact microglial form and function. Recent studies highlighting different microglial states and transcriptional signatures have highlighted modifications in lipid processing as defining these states. This review highlights these recent studies and uses these altered pathways to discuss the current understanding of lipid biology in microglia. The studies highlighted here review how lipids may alter microglial phagocytic functioning or alter their pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory balance. These studies provide a foundation by which lipid supplementation or diet alterations could influence microglial states and function.

        <tr id="Neurological injury drives most deaths and morbidity among patients hospitalized for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Despite its clinical importance, there are no effective pharmacological therapies targeting post-cardiac arrest (CA) neurological injury. Here, we analyzed circulating immune cells from a large cohort of patients with OHCA, finding that lymphopenia independently associated with poor neurological outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells showed that T cells with features of both innate T cells and natural killer (NK) cells were increased in patients with favorable neurological outcomes. We more specifically identified an early increase in circulating diverse NKT (dNKT) cells in a separate cohort of patients with OHCA who had good neurological outcomes. These cells harbored a diverse T cell receptor repertoire but were consistently specific for sulfatide antigen. In mice, we found that sulfatide-specific dNKT cells trafficked to the brain after CA and resuscitation. In the brains of mice lacking NKT cells (Cd1d-/-), we observed increased inflammatory chemokine and cytokine expression and accumulation of macrophages when compared with wild-type mice. Cd1d-/- mice also had increased neuronal injury, neurological dysfunction, and worse mortality after CA. To therapeutically enhance dNKT cell activity, we treated mice with sulfatide lipid after CA, showing that it improved neurological function. Together, these data show that sulfatide-specific dNKT cells are associated with good neurological outcomes after clinical OHCA and are neuroprotective in mice after CA. Strategies to enhance the number or function of dNKT cells may thus represent a treatment approach for CA.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
African Americans (AA) are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there is a scarcity of research focusing on understanding the neuroimmune component of AD pathogenesis in this population. It is generally accepted that microglia would be an ideal therapeutic target for AD and that genetic, lifestyle, societal and environmental factors and stressors have the potential to shape microglia phenotypes and their contribution to neurodegenerative processes. The overarching goal of the current study is to establish the population structure of microglia in older AAs and to investigate the relationship of the different microglia subsets with histopathological hallmarks of brain aging and AD in AAs.


METHOD
We utilized our established pipeline to isolate live microglia (and other immune cells) from human brain and investigate them at the single cell level using a multi-omic approach employing transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic profiling. This approach, that has recently yielded the first map of microglia population structure in the aged human brain of NHW donors, has been supplemented with in situ investigation of microglia phenotypes and their association with AD pathology in archival tissue specimens.


RESULT
We isolated and profiled live microglia from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior watershed deep white matter of 10 AA donors from the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). Both of these brain regions have been previously associated with cognitive decline. Using single cell RNA-sequencing, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the data revealed nine distinct microglia phenotypes: two homeostatic subsets and seven differentiated subsets, similarly to what we previously described in NHW donors. Intriguingly, we detected a different population structure of microglia in AA donors when compared to NHWs. To establish an in depth understanding of these findings we investigated the chromatin accessibility and proteomic profile of the different subsets as well as their relationship to histopathological traits of brain aging in AA donors.


CONCLUSION
While microglia in the cortex and white matter of older AA donors acquire the same functional phenotypes as microglia in the brains of NHW donors, they display a distinct population structure. Our findings underline the importance of studying the neuroimmune compartment of AD specifically in AAs.">

        <tr id="Introduction Despite continued improvement in post-sepsis survival, long term morbidity and mortality remain high. Chronic critical illness (CCI), defined as persistent inflammation and organ injury requiring prolonged intensive care, is a harbinger of poor long-term outcomes in sepsis survivors. Current dogma states that sepsis survivors are immunosuppressed, particularly in CCI. Investigation of this immune suppression in heterogeneous immune populations across distinct clinical trajectories and outcomes, along with limited sampling access, is accessible via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods scRNA-seq analysis was performed on healthy subjects (n=12), acutely septic patients at day 4 ± 1 (n=4), and those defined as rapid recovery (n=4) or CCI (n=5) at day 14-21. Differential gene expression and pathway analyses were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes at both a population and annotated cell subset level. Cellular function was assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot), cytokine production analysis, and T-cell proliferation assays on an additional cohort of septic patients (19 healthy, 68 acutely septic, 27 rapid recovery and 20 classified as CCI 14-21 days after sepsis onset). Results Sepsis survivors that developed CCI exhibited proportional shifts within lymphoid cell populations, with expanded frequency of CD8+ and NK cells. Differential expression and pathway analyses revealed continued activation in T cells and NK cells, with generalized suppression of B-cell function. Both T and NK cell subsets displayed transcriptomic profiles of exhaustion and immunosuppression in CCI, particularly in CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells and NK cells. Functional validation of T-cell behavior in an independent cohort demonstrated T cells maintained proliferative responses in vitro yet exhibited a marked loss of cytokine production. IFN-γ production at the acute phase (day 4 ± 1) was significantly reduced in subjects later classified as CCI. Discussion Sepsis patients exhibit unique T-, B-, and NK-cell transcriptional patterns that are both time- and clinical trajectory-dependent. These transcriptomic and pathway differences in sepsis patients that develop CCI are associated with exhaustion in CD8+ TEM cells and NK cells. Understanding the specific immune system patterns of different cell subsets after sepsis at a molecular level will be key to the development of personalized immunotherapy and drug-targeting intervention.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Sepsis‐associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a serious neurologic complication in septic patients with poor prognoses. There is increasing evidence that stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. However, whether sepsis associated with STING changes contributes to cognitive impairment is unknown. Methods Male adult mice received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection (a single dose of 4 mg/kg; i.p. injection) and 30 min later, they were injected with STING inhibitor C‐176 (a single dose of 30 mg/kg, i.p. injection). Behavioral assessments, biochemical measurements, in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology techniques were conducted to investigate the association between LPS‐induced STING overexpression and cognitive function. Results Cognitive impairment was associated with STING overexpression and activation of microglia/macrophages. Phagocytosis of microglia/macrophages as well as complement C1q release were increased after LPS injection, leading to abnormal pruning synapses, synaptic transmission reduction, long‐term potentiation (LTP) impairment, as well as abnormal theta oscillation in the hippocampus. Notably, STING inhibitor C‐176 significantly reversed these changes. Conclusions Sepsis‐induced STING overexpression in microglia/macrophages may lead to synaptic loss, abnormal theta oscillation and LTP impairment through microglia/macrophages activation and complement C1q modulation, ultimately resulting in cognitive impairment.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT
Hepatic encephalopathy, defined as neuropsychiatric dysfunction secondary to liver disease, is a frequent decompensating event in cirrhosis. Its clinical impact is highlighted by a notable increase in patient mortality rates and a concomitant reduction in overall quality of life. Systemically, liver disease, liver function failure, portosystemic shunting, and associated multi-organ dysfunction result in the increase of disease-causing neurotoxins in the circulation, which impairs cerebral homeostasis. Key circulating neurotoxins are ammonia and inflammatory mediators. In the brain, pathophysiology is less well understood, but is thought to be driven by glial cell dysfunction. Astrocytes are the only brain resident cells that have ammonia-metabolizing machinery and are therefore putatively most susceptible to ammonia elevation. Based on a large body of mostly in vitro evidence, ammonia-induced cellular and molecular disturbances include astrocyte swelling and oxidative stress. Microglia, the brain resident macrophages, have been linked to the translation of systemic inflammation to the brain microenvironment. Recent evidence from animal studies has provided novel insights into old and new downstream effects of astrocyte and microglial dysfunction such as toxin clearance disruption and myeloid cell attraction to the central nervous system parenchyma. Furthermore, state of the art research increasingly implicates neuronal dysfunction and possibly even irreversible neuronal cell death. Cell-type specific investigation in animal models highlights the need for critical revision of the contribution of astrocytes and microglia to well- established and novel cellular and molecular alterations in hepatic encephalopathy. In this review, we therefore give a current and comprehensive overview of causes, features, and consequences of astrocyte and microglial dysfunction in hepatic encephalopathy, including areas of interest for future investigation.">

        <tr id="Severe lower respiratory tract disease following influenza A virus (IAV) infection is characterized by excessive inflammation and lung tissue damage, and this can impair lung function. The effect of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), which detects viral RNA to initiate antiviral and proinflammatory responses to IAV, on lung function during peak infection and in the resolution phase is not fully understood. Using wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and TLR7 knockout (TLR7 KO) mice, we found that IAV infection induced airway dysfunction in both genotypes, although in TLR7 KO mice, this dysfunction manifested later, did not affect lung tissue elastance and damping, and was associated with a different immune phenotype. A positive correlation was found between lung dysfunction and the infiltration of neutrophils and Ly6Clo patrolling monocytes at day 7 post-infection. Conversely, in TLR7 KO mice, eosinophil and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were associated with airway hyperactivity at day 14. IL-5 expression was higher in the airways of IAV-infected TLR7 KO mice, suggesting an enhanced Th2 response due to TLR7 deficiency. This study highlights an underappreciated duality of TLR7 in IAV disease: promoting inflammation-driven lung dysfunction during the acute infection but suppressing eosinophilic and CD8+ T cell-dependent hyperresponsiveness during disease resolution.">

        <tr id="Although macrophages in the meningeal compartments of the central nervous system (CNS) have been comprehensively characterized under steady state, studying their contribution to physiological and pathological processes has been hindered by the lack of specific targeting tools in vivo. Recent findings have shown that the dural sinus and its adjacent lymphatic vessels act as a neuroimmune interface. However, the cellular and functional heterogeneity of extrasinusoidal dural macrophages outside this immune hub is not fully understood. Therefore, we comprehensively characterized these cells using single-cell transcriptomics, fate mapping, confocal imaging, clonal analysis, and transgenic mouse lines. Extrasinusoidal dural macrophages were distinct from leptomeningeal and CNS parenchymal macrophages in terms of their origin, expansion kinetics, and transcriptional profiles. During autoimmune neuroinflammation, extrasinusoidal dural macrophages performed efferocytosis of apoptotic granulocytes. Our results highlight a previously unappreciated myeloid cell diversity and provide insights into the brain's innate immune system.">

        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Factors regulating the severity of pneumonitis during viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found higher expression of protein S (PROS1) in lung epithelium of mild compared to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We hypothesized that PROS1 may protect the upper airways by regulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods To test this, in vitro air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary healthy human lung epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2. This model, validated through immunofluorescent staining, confocal microscopy, and single-cell RNA-sequencing, replicated pathogenic changes seen in the lungs of COVID-19. Regulation and secretion of PROS1, along with multiple soluble mediators, were quantified in control and infected cultures using ELISAs. Results We found that PROS1 is present in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium and is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection through an IFN-mediated process. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PROS1 downregulated the SARS-CoV-2-induced proinflammatory phenotypes of basal cells, transforming pathogenic CXCL10/11high into a regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 increased the secretion of M-CSF from epithelial cells, which induced the expression of PROS1 receptor MERTK on monocytes interacting with the lung epithelium. PROS1, in turn, shifted SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenic monocyte phenotypes toward a phenotype with increased MHC class II. Conclusion These findings highlight the crucial role of PROS1 in protecting against severe lung pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2, by reducing epithelial- and monocyte-derived inflammation, promoting pro-repair epithelial phenotypes, and enhancing antigen presentation in myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Background CNS infection by HIV-1 contributes to neuroinflammation, cognitive impairments, and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Although HIV-1 is known to enter the brain early in infection via “Trojan horse” leukocytes, including infected monocytes and CD4+T cells, the specific cellular phenotypes facilitating this process during acute infection remain incompletely characterized. Objective This study aims to characterize the roles of brain lymphocytes during acute infection and primary CD4+ T cell phenotypes seeding the SIV to the CNS. Methods scRNA-seq was performed on brain and blood cells of three acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The transcriptomic data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches and validated through in vitro co-culture assays and re-analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset. Results We found a distinct cell cluster in the brain co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, suggesting brain myeloid cells may engulf CD4+ T cells entering from the blood. This finding was confirmed in by coculture studies of macrophages and T cells, and identified specific chemokines could distinguish such cells. Acute infection induced an increase in proliferating CD4+ cytotoxic-like T cells, which had high expression of viral entry receptors and adhesion molecules, indicating their role in CNS infection. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of cytotoxic genes, MHC class II molecules, ISG15, and USP18 in brain lymphocytes, indicating a robust immune response to acute infection. Conclusion Our findings suggest that CD4+cytotoxic-like T cells represent a key lymphocyte subset responsible for initiating SIV entry into the brain and triggering neuroinflammatory processes. Furthermore, interactions between infiltrating lymphocytes and brain-resident myeloid cells may facilitate viral propagation within the CNS.">

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) syndrome or “Long COVID” represents a widespread health challenge that necessitates the development of novel diagnostic approaches and targeted therapies that can be readily deployed. Immune dysregulation has been reported as one of the hallmarks of PASC, but the extent of PASC immune dysregulation in patients over time remains unclear. We therefore assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, peripheral immune cell profiles, autoantibody profiles and circulating cytokines for up to 6 months in participants with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who either convalesced or developed PASC. Compared to convalescent, PASC participants with a broad range of PASC phenotypes exhibited persistently elevated IgG titers for SARS-CoV-2 Envelope and Nucleocapsid proteins over the 6 months of study duration. In contrast, the IgG responses to Spike protein were significantly lower in the PASC cohort with predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 class-switched bias. Using CyTOF analysis, we show elevated numbers of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) and mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT), which also correlated with high anti-Envelope IgG titers. Persistent immune activation was accompanied by augmented serum cytokine profiles with LIF, IL-11, Eotaxin-3, and HMGB-1 in PASC participants, who also demonstrated significantly higher rates of autoantibodies. These findings highlight the persistence of immune dysregulation in PASC, underscoring the need to explore targeted therapies addressing viral persistence, dysregulated antibody production, and autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="While human autopsy samples have provided insights into pulmonary immune mechanisms associated with severe viral respiratory diseases, the mechanisms that contribute to a clinically favorable resolution of viral respiratory infections remain unclear due to the lack of proper experimental systems. Using mice co-engrafted with a genetically matched human immune system and fetal lung xenograft (fLX), we mapped the immunological events defining successful resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues. Viral infection is rapidly cleared from fLX following a peak of viral replication, histopathological manifestations of lung disease and loss of AT2 program, as reported in human COVID-19 patients. Infection resolution is associated with the activation of a limited number of hematopoietic subsets, including inflammatory monocytes and CD3-expressing macrophage-like cells, which are highly enriched in viral RNA and dissipate upon infection resolution. Specific human fibroblast and endothelial subsets also elicit robust antiviral and monocyte chemotaxis signatures, respectively. Notably, systemic depletion of human CD4 + cells, but not CD3 + cells, significantly abrogates infection resolution in fLX and induces persistent infection, supporting the dominant role of peripheral CD4 + monocytes over T-cells in the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings unravel a comprehensive picture of the immunological events defining effective resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues, revealing markedly divergent immunological trajectories between resolving and fatal COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to study how human immune responses develop to a novel viral antigen delivered through different vaccine platforms. However, to date, no study has directly compared immune responses to all three FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines at single-cell multi-omic resolution. We longitudinally profiled SARS-CoV-2–naïve adults (n=31) vaccinated with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S, integrating plasma cytokines, antibody titers, and single-cell multi-omic data (DOGMA-seq). We discovered a distinct, transient interferon program (ISG-dim) that emerged specifically 1–2 days after the first mRNA dose in ~10% of myeloid cells. This state was characterized by ISGF3 complex activation and its target genes (e.g., MX1, MX2, DDX58), with transcriptional and epigenetic profiles distinct from the robust interferon program observed after mRNA boosting or a single Ad26.COV2.S dose (ISG-high). In vitro stimulation of human monocytes showed that IFN-α alone recapitulates ISG-dim, whereas both IFN-α and IFN-γ are required for ISG-high. These findings define dose-dependent interferon programming in human myeloid cells, highlight mechanistic differences between priming and boosting, with implications for optimizing vaccine platform choice, dose scheduling, and formulation.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, respiratory complications and cognitive dysfunction, affecting approximately 13.5% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Despite its clinical significance, the mechanisms driving PASC remain poorly understood. Here, to address this, we utilized a Phodopus roborovskii hamster model to investigate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with influenza A virus. While 46.25–47.50% of hamsters survived SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus H1N1 infection, 13.75% of SARS-CoV-2 survivors exhibited impaired weight recovery, severe lung pathology and significant neutrophil accumulation, defining the PASC group. Single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung and spleen at 30 days post-infection revealed hallmark PASC gene signatures uniquely upregulated in the PASC group. This was accompanied by elevated neutrophil levels and reduced macrophage populations, indicative of disrupted myeloid cell differentiation. Immunohistochemistry further detected persistent SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit antigen in the lungs of PASC hamsters at 30 days post-infection, coinciding with marked neutrophil infiltration, which probably drove prolonged inflammatory responses. Indeed, the neutrophils in the PASC group exhibited sustained upregulation of inflammation-related genes, including FPR2, MMP9 and S100A9, which are associated with neutrophil degranulation and extracellular trap formation. Importantly, targeting neutrophil-mediated inflammation with small-molecule inhibitors substantially reduced PASC phenotypes. Among these, Sivelestat, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, demonstrated the most pronounced efficacy, reducing PASC incidence and mortality, and markedly reducing neutrophil levels. These findings underscore the critical role of neutrophil activation in driving lung damage and chronic inflammation during PASC, offering promising therapeutic strategies for mitigating long-term COVID-19 sequelae.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Understanding age-associated differences in acute and memory adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and how this contributes to more favorable outcomes in children is critically important.


METHODS
We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell, B cell, and antibody responses in 329 peripheral blood samples collected from non-hospitalized children, adolescents, and adults at three timepoints, including acute and memory timepoints.


RESULTS
Most children produced robust CD4+ T cell responses during infection and developed memory CD4+ T cells; however, young children <4 years old often had undetectable CD4+ T cell responses compared to older children and adults. Young children also generated reduced frequencies of memory B cells; despite this, they mounted substantial and durable neutralizing antibody responses. CD4+ T cell responses in children were biased towards non-spike epitopes, especially in asymptomatic cases. Memory B cells in children were preferentially classical memory or, paradoxically, CXCR3+.


CONCLUSION
These findings support the concept that the kinetics and composition of T and B cell responses shift across age groups and may be associated with milder COVID-19 outcomes in children.">

        <tr id="Sweet syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory skin disorder characterized by erythematous plaques with a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate. First-line therapy remains oral corticosteroids, which suppresses inflammation non-specifically. Although neutrophils are typically short-lived, how they persist in Sweet syndrome skin and contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized population of antigen-presenting cell (APC)-like neutrophils expressing MHC class II genes that are uniquely present in Sweet syndrome skin but absent from healthy tissue and circulation. Keratinocytes extended neutrophil lifespan 10-fold in co-culture experiments and drove the emergence of an APC-like phenotype in approximately 30% of neutrophils, mirroring observations in patient lesions. Mechanistically, keratinocyte-derived serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) signals through the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on neutrophils to promote their survival. These long-lived neutrophils actively orchestrate local immune responses by recruiting T cells and inducing cytokine production. Strikingly, dual blockade of SAA1-FPR2 signaling restores neutrophil turnover to baseline levels, with efficacy comparable to high-dose corticosteroids. These findings uncover a keratinocyte-neutrophil-T cell axis that sustains chronic inflammation in Sweet syndrome and highlight the SAA1/FPR2 pathway as a promising target for precision therapy.">

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, and accounts for the majority of malaria-associated mortality. Reducing the overwhelming inflammatory responses in the early stage of infection is a key point to prevent death due to CM. In this study, we found that neutrophil mobilization occurred rapidly in response to Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection in a murine CM model. Depletion of neutrophils protected the infected mice from neuropathology, with low infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells in the brain, and attenuated activation of dendritic cell (DC) and parasite-specific T cell responses in the spleen. Flow cytometry analysis showed that following PbA infection the expression of TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 were increased in splenic DC, while only TLR9 expression was reduced after the depletion of neutrophils. To validate the TLR9-dependent activation between neutrophils and DC, we used neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to stimulate bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDC) from WT and Tlr9−/− mice. The results showed that the DNA component of NETs activates DCs through the TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to upregulated expression of costimulatory molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which was abolished by DNase I. BMDC stimulated by NETs promoted CD8+ T cell activation with TLR9 dependence. Inhibiting NETs with Sivelestat effectively impeded the onset and progression of CM in the PbA infected mice. Collectively, our results indicated that neutrophil cell death (NETosis) induced TLR9-dependent DC activation and pathogenic CD8+ T cell responses, revealing that the NETs-TLR9/NF-κB-DC-CD8+ T cell axis may provide novel insights into the immunopathogenic mechanisms of CM.

        <tr id="Objective Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health burden, characterized by complex host–pathogen interactions that drive heterogeneous clinical outcomes. While pulmonary epithelial cells are increasingly recognized as active participants in innate immunity during Mtb infection, how host defense are altered when the epithelial barrier is compromised remains unclear. Methods In this study, we developed a murine model combining naphthalene-induced pulmonary epithelial injury with Mtb infection and mapped the pulmonary cells landscape through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), followed by in vitro stimulation assays to validate macrophage functional changes. Results Notably, we found a pronounced impairment in pulmonary bacterial clearance. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a widespread suppression of epithelial immune functions and showed that macrophages transitioned from an antimicrobial to an antigen-presenting phenotype, indicating waning pulmonary innate defenses and heightened adaptive immune activation. In vitro experiments further suggested that this macrophage transition may be linked to epithelial cell alterations. Conclusions These findings indicate that pulmonary epithelial integrity may influence early host immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and provide a transcriptomic framework for exploring epithelial–immune crosstalk as a potential therapeutic target.

        <tr id="APOBEC3B (A3B) has been implicated in host–virus interactions, but its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that A3B is overexpressed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from severe COVID-19 patients compared to those with mild disease. A3B knockdown in Caco-2 cells significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, likely through attenuation of the PKR-mediated integrated stress response, a pathway proposed to promote SARS-CoV-2. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data suggest that BALF cells from severe COVID-19 patients exhibit a repressed state for cellular translation, potentially mediated by eIF2α phosphorylation. However, in A549-ACE2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 does not activate PKR, but A3B knockdown still reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action in different cellular contexts. To further investigate A3B’s role in severe COVID-19, we employed Geneformer, a transformer-based machine learning model, which predicted that A3B knockout would perturb AMPD2 (adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2), a key enzyme in purine metabolism and immune regulation. We validated this prediction using bulk RNA-seq and clinical scRNA-seq data, confirming that AMPD2 expression is downregulated in severe COVID-19 but restored upon A3B knockdown. Together, these findings suggest that A3B plays a proviral role in SARS-CoV-2 infection by modulating translational control and immune regulatory networks, warranting further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanistic details.">

Unsupervised clustering identified major immune populations including CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Differential gene expression suggests that low Cell-IR cattle have in elevated NKT inflammatory response, while high Cell-IR cattle have increased CD8- γδ T cell and pro-inflammatory myeloid activity.

        <tr id="Children with COVID-19 typically experience milder symptoms and lower hospitalization rates, though severe cases do occur. Understanding age-related immune responses is crucial for future preparedness. We characterized immune response dynamics to SARS-CoV-2 in 145 samples from 119 pediatric patients (<18 years) with confirmed infection, assessed at four distinct time points: <14 days, 14 days–3 months, 3–6 months, and 6–12 months post-infection. At infection, patients presented increased activated T-cells, higher levels of exhaustion (i.e., PD-1+), lower numbers of unswitched memory B-cells, and increased antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Both humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses increased over time (all patients showed measurable responses in the last assessment). Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients (58.6%) showed increased specific cellular responses from infection onwards, along with enriched memory B-cell subsets (but not ASCs), and distinct T-cell activation profiles. Children with severe disease were younger, predominantly boys, displayed altered T/B-cell ratios, and reduced PHA responses when infected. Compared to adolescents, younger children showed lower antibody titers and weaker cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2, possibly underlining the higher prevalence of severe manifestations in younger children. Our study illustrates important age-, gender-, and disease severity-dependent variations in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which can be helpful in improving patient management and immunization strategies adjusted to age groups.">

Complications arising from viral infections in these age groups can present therapeutic challenges, as most of these individuals have impaired adaptive immunity. Using the T‐ and B cell‐deficient Rag2−/− mice, the mechanisms that mediate protection in immunocompromised hosts during RSV infection can be investigated. RSV‐infected Rag2−/− mice showed no symptoms of disease or chronic inflammation in the lungs and airways despite the presence of infectious virus in their lungs several months after infection. Interestingly, Natural Killer (NK) cells, the main innate cells with anti‐viral cytotoxic effector functions, were recruited 2 days earlier in the lungs of Rag2−/− mice compared with wildtype mice, resulting in early production of IFN‐γ. However, depletion of NK cells did not affect disease severity or viral load. Together, these results suggest that the NK cells are largely dispensable for virus control during primary RSV infection in Rag2−/− mice.">

To elucidate the host immune responses driving these differences, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of lung and blood samples from human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice infected with either the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain or the Omicron BA.1 variant at 5 days post-inoculation. Both strains induced a reduction in lung cell numbers, with capillary endothelial cells showing the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Shared transcriptional responses included upregulation of chemokine (e.g. Gnaq, Lyn, Ccl5) and IL-17 signaling pathways. Notably, Omicron BA.1 infection resulted in downregulation of Txnip, a key gene involved in oxidative stress responses. Genes associated with neutrophil granules and pro-inflammatory functions (Mmp8, S100a8, S100a9) were also downregulated, whereas wound healing pathways were upregulated in immature neutrophils. Additionally, Omicron BA.1 altered gene expression associated with neutrophil migration from blood to lung, and decreased the activation of cell chemotaxis, cytokine-mediated signaling, IL-17 and NF-κB pathways in pro-inflammatory monocytes and pulmonary interstitial macrophages. These findings highlight distinct immunological signatures contributing to the attenuated pathogenicity of Omicron BA.1, particularly through the modulation of neutrophil and monocyte-macrophage responses.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY During Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, infected alveolar macrophages (AMs) initially up-regulate a NRF2 regulated cell-protective program, which is detrimental to host control and impedes AM activation, including MHC II expression. MHC II is critical for CD4+ T cell activation and host immunity during Mtb infection. We hypothesized that NRF2 regulates the MHC II pathway and AM antigen presentation to T cells. We found that NRF2 inhibits MHC II, but not MHC I, specifically in AMs, following Mtb infection in vitro and in vivo. NRF2 dampens Ciita and H2-Ab1 gene expression in uninfected AMs, and MHC II inhibition by NRF2 is retained following innate stimuli and IFNγ exposure. NRF2 expression in Mtb-infected AMs impedes their ability to activate ESAT6-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, although NRF2 expression enhances cell-protective functions, it has the unexpected consequence of limiting innate-adaptive crosstalk, which can impair CD4+ T cell activation and host immunity during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="The recent COVID-19 pandemic left behind the lingering question as whether new variants of concern might cause further waves of infection. Thus, it is important to investigate the long-term protection gained via vaccination or exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here we compare the evolution of memory T-cell responses following primary infection with subsequent antigen exposures. Single-cell TCR analysis of three dominant SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T-cell responses identifies the dominant public TCRα clonotypes pairing with diverse TCRβ clonotypes that associated with mild disease at primary infection. These clonotypes are found at higher frequencies in pre-pandemic repertoires compared to other epitope-specific clonotypes. Longitudinal transcriptomics and TCR analysis, combined with functional evaluation, reveals that the clonotypes persisting 3–4 years post initial infection exhibit distinct functionality compared to those that were lost. Furthermore, spike-specific CD4+ T cells at this time point show decreased Th1 signatures and enhanced GZMA-driven cytotoxic transcriptomic profiles that were independent of TCR clonotype and associated with viral suppression. In summary, we identify common public TCRs used by immunodominant spike-specific memory CD4+ T-cells, associated with mild disease outcome, which likely play important protective roles to subsequent viral infection events.">

        <tr id="African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an important transboundary animal pathogen with significant impacts on the global swine industry. Overwhelming proinflammatory responses are a major virulence mechanism for ASFV, but the dynamics of these changes during clinical disease are not completely understood. We constructed a detailed portrait of the innate immune responses during acute African swine fever (ASF) at the cellular, transcriptomic, and cytokine levels. Samples serially obtained from infected piglets show progression of acute ASF is characterized by rapid increases in plasma type I interferons, TNF-α, IL-12p40, and IL-10, which coincide with the manifestation of clinical disease and viral DNAemia. Lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells progressively declined, with fluctuations in B cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell populations. Blood monocytes and macrophages were highly variable throughout infection, with an abrupt spike in CD203+ mature macrophages immediately prior to death. Transcriptomic analysis of blood showed downregulation of cellular translation as early as 1 day post challenge (DPC), and significant upregulation of antiviral immune processes at 5 DPC and 7 DPC which overlapped with the onset of clinical disease. Together, these results present a highly detailed delineation of fatal ASF as involving an initial infection and damage of susceptible myeloid cells prior to symptomatic disease characterized by pro-inflammatory immune responses, lymphoid depletion, and clinical deterioration.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic, significantly impacting social and economic aspects of society. While belonging to the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 exhibited unique characteristics that facilitated its widespread transmission and pathogenicity. This study aimed to investigate the molecular characterization and infection kinetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence. We isolated 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants from clinical samples and conducted in vitro studies using Calu-3 cell lines and pseudovirus systems to explore viral entry. Whole-genome sequencing identified mutations linked to increased replication and enhanced immune evasion, particularly through the inhibition of interferon responses. Additionally, persistence studies on common environmental surfaces (copper, aluminum, and plastic) revealed that certain variants, such as G446S, contributed to increased viral stability, suggesting potential for indirect transmission beyond direct person-to-person contact. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of “green” disinfectants, including tea tree oil and quercetin-based compounds, which demonstrated viral load reductions of over 95% within minutes, outperforming conventional alcohol- and UV-based disinfection methods. Notably, two influenza virus isolates belonging to highly divergent subtypes are sanitized as well while showing different persistence surface profiles compared to SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight the evolutionary strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 to ensure transmission, its ability to adapt under selective pressure, and the importance of ongoing surveillance of emerging variants. Moreover, the efficacy of environmentally sustainable disinfectants presents a promising strategy for reducing viral transmission in both clinical and community settings. IMPORTANCE In this study, we evaluated the molecular profile of 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence.

This study aimed to assess the potential of T cell response monitoring in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We compared antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses in a subpopulation (n = 109) of children and adolescents from the Ciao Corona cohort study. Participants were followed up over 6 months, from November/December 2021 to June/July 2022, during the Delta and Omicron waves in Switzerland. Results Circulating, virus-specific T cell responses in children and adolescents were generally low and heterogeneous. T cell-mediated responses were not consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection status, with responses detectable in some seronegative individuals and not detectable in a considerable number of seropositive participants. Conclusion Circulating, virus-specific T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents from the general population offer limited additional insight. Monitoring humoral immunity is likely a more cost-effective approach and should be the primary focus of immunological surveillance in the general paediatric population.">

        <tr id="Intoduction T lymphocytes, along with cytokines and chemokines-dependent pathways are primarily responsible for regulating the immune response, controlling inflammation and eliminating viral infections. However, excessive immune activity can lead to pathological effects such as cytokine storm, which may cause severe respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ damage in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection that could predict the severity of COVID-19 progression. Methods The cohort in this study included 52 hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from Warsaw, Poland admitted to the hospital during COVID-19 pandemic (February to November 2021). Based on clinical symptoms, patients were divided into two groups: (i) mild/moderate symptoms (non-severe) – 44 patients and (ii) severe respiratory failure (severe) – 8 patients. The control group consisted of 26 individuals without COVID-19. All COVID-19 patients and healthy controls underwent immunophenotyping of peripheral blood to assess the abundance of T lymphocytes and regulatory T lymphocytes, as well as measurement of selected cytokine and chemokine concentrations in corresponding serum samples. Data analysis was performed using CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer. Results and discussion Decreased percentages of total lymphocytes and T lymphocytes in peripheral blood were observed across all COVID-19 patients, with varying degrees between the non-severe and severe groups. A significant reduction was also noted in double-positive lymphocytes (CD4+CD8+), regulatory T lymphocytes ( CD4+ CD25HiCD127Lo and CD4+CD25HiCD127LoFoxP3+), as well as CD4+CD25+/-, CD4+CD45RA+/-, and CD8+CD45RA+/- subsets. Elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-g, CCL2, CXCL8, and CXCL10 were observed in the non-severe and/or severe groups compared to healthy controls. Most importantly, only CXCL10 was significantly elevated in the severe group at admission compared to the non-severe group. In this study, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 as a crucial marker for distinguishing the severe course of COVID-19 from non-severe form at the time of admission. It may serve as an early indicator of diseases progression during hospitalization, potentially allowing prediction of the disease course. Moreover, elevated CXCL10 levels, in combination with decreased total lymphocytes counts and increased levels of IL-6, IL10, IFNg, CCL2 and CXCL9, may represent a more comprehensive biomarker panel suitable for predicting the severity of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="There is an increasing need to understand the long-term dynamics and quality of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory—both humoral and cellular—particularly with emerging variants. This study aimed to evaluate immune durability and variant-specific modulation through a longitudinal analysis of individuals with diverse SARS-CoV-2 exposure histories, over two years after infection and/or vaccination. The study involved assessing anti-spike IgG and IgA levels over time and analyzing their relationship with neutralizing activity against both ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants. Persistence of T cell responses was evaluated using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and activation-induced marker (AIM) assays. Anti-S IgG levels remained stable over time and increased after each immune stimulation, suggesting cumulative immune memory. Neutralizing capacity correlated strongly with IgG levels, showing long-term stability for pre-Omicron variants, but a moderate decline for Omicron. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses persisted across all groups, largely unaffected by Omicron mutations. However, cytokine profiles revealed subtle, variant-dependent changes. These findings underscore the durability of cellular immunity and the comparatively reduced robustness of Omicron-specific humoral responses. Such insights are crucial for understanding long-term protection against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and guiding public health strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Coronaviruses encode nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15), a conserved endoribonuclease (EndoU) known to suppress host antiviral responses. It is imperative to understand the role of Nsp15/EndoU during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in its primary target respiratory epithelial cells. Using a recombinant wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (rWT) and a mutant with catalytically inactive EndoU (rH234A), we show that the EndoU activity is dispensable for viral replication in Vero cells but critically facilitates immune suppression and infection in physiologically relevant human lung cells, including human lung-derived epithelial cell lines, primary bronchial air-liquid interface cultures, and alveolar type 2 organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Compared to rWT, rH234A infection elicited augmented type I and III interferon (IFN) responses and stronger RNase L activation, suggesting that Nsp15 suppresses these antiviral pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although rH234A infection increased PKR phosphorylation, downstream eIF2α phosphorylation and stress granule formation remained limited, implying incomplete PKR/eIF2α pathway activation. Furthermore, Nsp15 mutants lacking key residues required for hexamerization or double-stranded RNA binding also showed impaired replication and heightened IFN responses, highlighting the importance of these structural features for EndoU function. In vivo, rH234A was attenuated in K18-hACE2 mice, resulting in improved survival, reduced viral loads, and milder lung pathology. Together, these findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15/EndoU as a key immune antagonist that facilitates lung infection, underscoring its potential as a target for antiviral development. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects upper and lower airway epithelial cells, and the latter infection can result in severe pneumonia. Understanding how the virus evades host immunity in these primary target cells is critical for developing effective therapies. Nsp15, a conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease (EndoU), is known to suppress antiviral responses, but its precise role in respiratory epithelial cells has remained unclear. This study reveals that while EndoU activity is dispensable for viral replication, it is essential for dampening host defenses in human lung-derived epithelial cell lines, primary bronchial air-liquid interface cultures, and alveolar type 2 organoids. Loss of EndoU activity results in enhanced interferon signaling and RNase L activation, along with partial PKR pathway engagement. Structural integrity, including double-stranded RNA binding and hexamerization, is vital for Nsp15 function. In vivo, an EndoU-deficient virus is attenuated in K18-hACE2 mice. These findings position Nsp15 as a key immune antagonist and a promising target for antiviral intervention.">

        <tr id="A Cytokine storm is critical in severe dengue, significantly contributing to disrupted endothelial integrity, plasma leakage, and haemorrhage manifestations in affected patients. Various reports have demonstrated that mononuclear phagocytes, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, are target cells of DENV infection. They contribute to viral spread into tissues and promote robust inflammatory responses and immunopathology. However, it remains unclear whether the early events of DENV infection play a role in triggering cytokine storms in infected mononuclear phagocytes. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profile of in vitro DENV-2-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) based on the kinetics of viral replication through a standard growth curve. To verify the accuracy of our approach, we used RT-qPCR, ELISA, and transcriptomic data from in vitro DENV-2-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and monocytes obtained from acute dengue patients. RNA-Seq analysis revealed dynamic changes in the transcriptional profile of DENV-2-infected MDMs throughout the viral growth curve. Two waves of differentially expressed genes were observed: the first occurred during the eclipse period of viral replication (3 to 5.5 h.p.i) and was associated with the induction of NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory factors, while the second wave at 24 h.p.i coincided with peaks of DENV-2 replication and induction of both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, DENV-2 infection promoted the dynamic activation of Toll-like receptors, RIG-like receptors, inflammasomes, and inflammatory pathways, triggering innate pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses. A robust multi-type IFN-dependent antiviral response was also observed at the late stage of infection. A similar transcriptomic profile was found in DENV-2-infected MDDCs and monocyte subsets from acute dengue patients, further confirming the reliability of our in vitro model of DENV-infected MDMs. Together, results suggest that recognizing viral PAMPs during the eclipse period of DENV-2 infection promotes a robust NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in MDMs. In addition, at later stages of infection, recognizing structural DENV-PAMPs and/or viral replication intermediates induces both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses, leading to a cytokine storm. These findings highlight the critical role of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in detecting DENV infection and triggering a cytokine storm in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that these cell populations could be potential targets for future immunotherapies to modulate the inflammatory response to DENV infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction An unbalanced immune response and excessive inflammation are the major hallmarks of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in multiorgan failure and death. The dysregulation of the complement system has been shown in various studies as a crucial factor in the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Complement alternative pathway has been linked to the excessive inflammation in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in which decreased levels of factor H (FH) and elevated levels of properdin (FP) were observed. The current study investigated the potential immune protective roles of FP and FH against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods The interactions between FH and FP and the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and its receptor binding domain (RBD) were evaluated using direct ELISA. The cell binding and luciferase-based viral entry assays utilising S protein expressing lentiviral pseudotypes were used to evaluate the possible modulatory effects of FH, FP, and recombinant thrombospondin repeats 4 and 5 (TSR4 + 5) on SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Using RT-qPCR, we also assessed the immunomodulatory roles of FH and FP in the cytokine response induced by SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes. Results FH and FP were found to bind to both the RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. The treatment of FP or TSR4 + 5 enhanced cell binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes that was administered in A549 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells). FP increases the affinity between host ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2, according to in silico work. In A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells, the effect of FP on viral cell entry and binding was counteracted by anti-FP antibody treatment. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudotypes’ cell entry and binding were decreased by FH treatment. The A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 alphaviral pseudotypes (expressing spike, envelope, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins) pre-treated with FP or TSR4+5 showed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts, including NF-κB and IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-α, and RANTES. Contrary to this, the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines was downregulated by FH treatment. FH treatment decreased S protein-mediated NF-κB activation, but FP treatment enhanced it in A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells. Discussion These results imply that FH may function as a SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and binding inhibitor, reducing the inflammatory response linked to infection independently of complement activation. FP could aid cell viral entry and binding and aggravate hyperinflammation that might contribute to the severity of the infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT RNA viruses have high mutation frequency, quick generation periods and vast population numbers, which promote fast evolution and host environment adaptation. We integrated scRNA‐seq and spatial transcriptomics to profile immune cells and viral gene expression in COVID‐19. Cell types and interactions were identified using Seurat‐based tools. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed viral hotspots, and GISAID data were used to track SARS‐CoV‐2 mutations. Single‐cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses revealed that immune cells such as Neutrophils, Monocyte:CD14 + , and T cell:CD4+ central memory are highly abundant in COVID‐19 patients, particularly in mild and severe cases, and are concentrated in the central and upper regions of lung tissue. Pseudotime and CellChat analyses indicated that cell differentiation trajectories and communication networks shift toward heightened inflammatory responses in severe conditions. Spatial analysis of viral gene expression showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 genes, especially Nucleoprotein, Spike and Envelope were highly expressed in central and upper‐right tissue regions, suggesting active viral replication. This localized viral activity was strongly associated with areas of immune cell infiltration and inflammation. The top 10 sustainable mutants in SARS‐CoV‐2 genome with high frequency were observed in NSP12 (P323L, 99%, Switzerland), Spike (D614G, 97%, Switzerland), NSP4 (T492I, 79%, Switzerland), NSP6 (T77A, 70%, Guangdong), Orf9c (G50N, 64%, England), Nucleoprotein (D377Y, 62%, United States), Orf9b (T60A, 61%, France), NSP14 (I42V, 55%, United States), Envelope (T9I, 51.3%, Trinidad and Tobago), and NSP5 (P132H, 51.2%, United States). Following to this approach is crucial for a strong epidemiological reaction against the changing SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) induces ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis, a form of lytic inflammatory cell death characterized by concurrent activation of the pyroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis pathways. Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) is a recently identified mediator of plasma membrane rupture but functions diversely in different types of cell death. However, little is known about the role of NINJ1 in IAV-induced PANoptosis and viral pneumonia. Here, we report that IAV infection triggered an increase in the expression of NINJ1, which then oligomerized and mediated cell lysis in infected macrophages. The deficiency of NINJ1 prevented plasma membrane rupture and the release of DAMPs and IL-1β without affecting the progression of cell death. Activation of any single PANoptosis pathway was sufficient to trigger the oligomerization of NINJ1 and robust cell lysis. Accordingly, only when all PANoptosis pathways were concurrently blocked could the oligomerization of NINJ1, cell death, and cell rupture be prevented. Ablation of NINJ1 in vivo also alleviated IAV-induced lung injury and mortality. Furthermore, we revealed an association between NINJ1 upregulation and poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Collectively, our findings indicate a pivotal role of NINJ1 in the immunopathology of IAV infection and its potential as a bioindicator of disease severity and prognosis in viral pneumonia and viral sepsis.">

The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased the investigation of their role in disease severity. However, their functional status and modulators remain controversial. Recent studies highlighted the role of metabolism in immune function, but metabolic changes in NK cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unexplored. This study compares metabolic (SIRT1, AMPKA, HIF1A, and GLUT1) and inflammatory (NFKB1, NFKB1A, IFNG, and SOCS1) gene expression, and flow cytometry-based assessment of functional markers in NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients (n=15) and the control group (n=10), and their association with clinical outcomes. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated IFNγ, Granzyme B, and KIR2DL1 expression in NK cells compared to controls (P < 0.005), while LAMP1 was unchanged (P > 0.05). NK cells from deceased patients exhibited significantly lower expression levels of LAMP1 and Granzyme B (P < 0.05). Patients hospitalized >7 days presented lower Granzyme-B+ NK cells (P < 0.05). NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients showed downregulation of HIF1A and GLUT1, and upregulation of NFKB1 (P < 0.05). HIF1A and GLUT1 expression were elevated in patients with >7 days of hospitalization (P < 0.05). SIRT1 expression was higher in patients requiring intubation (P < 0.05). SIRT1, HIF1A, and GLUT1 were upregulated in deceased patients (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrate that NK cells from patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit increased functional markers and dysregulated metabolic gene expression associated with clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Circulating platelets are increasingly recognized for their critical involvement in thromboinflammatory complications during respiratory infections, underscoring the importance of comprehending their dual role in immunomodulation and hemostasis. The multifaceted roles of platelets are attributed to their inherent heterogeneity, where the molecular diversity enables their functional versatility. However, research remains deficient in dissecting platelet heterogeneity within respiratory infection contexts, capturing the platelet subpopulations exhibiting specialized functional roles, and elucidating the therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab. Methods Leveraging the adequate platelet population detected through single-cell RNA sequencing, this study established stratified study cohorts central to: (1) COVID-19 disease severity, (2) therapeutic responsiveness, and (3) non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. An integrative annotation framework was implemented in this study, which encompassed co-expressed gene module identification, cell-cell communication network mapping, and cell trajectory assessment, to hierarchically dissect the functional dynamics of platelet heterogeneity in disease pathologies and their modulation by therapeutic interventions. Results This study unfolds six severity-associated platelet subpopulations, explores their modulation by corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments, and extends the findings to non-COVID-19 severe conditions. In severe COVID-19, platelet subpopulations with elevated innate immune responsiveness and high coagulation potential are intensively enriched, whereas following dexamethasone administration, this pro-coagulable subpopulation is remarkably repressed. Post-tocilizumab treatment, the instructive interaction from platelets to IFN-activated CD8+ T cells is reduced, while communications from memory B cells, CD4+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to platelets are enhanced. A platelet trajectory, which participates in neutrophil chemotaxis and B cell-mediated humoral responses, emerges specifically in COVID-19 conditions and is absent in non-COVID-19. Conclusions A systematic investigation of platelet transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory infections, combined with the delineation of its therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab, advances the understanding of platelet involvement in immune-thrombotic dysregulation and provides a foundation for exploring potential therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant became the dominant driver during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high transmissibility and immune escape potential. Although clinical outcomes are generally mild to moderate, the inflammatory mechanisms triggered by Omicron subvariants remain poorly defined. The goal of this study was to consider both viral evolution and the host immune response by assessing plasma cytokine levels in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Methods: A total of 115 individuals were recruited, including 40 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR. Demographic, clinical, and comorbidity data were collected. Plasma levels of IL-6, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17A were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array. Subvariant data were obtained from GISAID records and grouped into early (BA.1-lineage) and late (BA.4/BA.5-lineage) Omicron clusters. Statistical analysis included non-parametric and parametric tests, correlation matrices, and multivariate comparisons. Results: Pharyngitis, nasal discharge, cough, and headache were the most common symptoms among infected individuals. Despite no significant variation in symptom distribution across subvariants, infected patients showed higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-2 compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected controls (p < 0.05). IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in early Omicron infections. No associations were observed between cytokine levels and comorbidities. A significant correlation was found between reporting fewer symptoms and having received three vaccine doses. Conclusions: Infection with Omicron subvariants elicits a strong yet balanced cytokine response. Despite genetic divergence between lineages, immune and clinical patterns remain conserved, with vaccination appearing to mitigate the symptom burden.">

Recently, North American elk have been identified as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a potential threat to humans and other mammals. In this work, we characterized the peripheral transcriptomic response to experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in calves and adult elk at different time points. Results Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified at 2-, 5-, and 14-days post inoculation (pi) for both age groups. Adult elk presented the greatest number of differentially expressed (DE) genes at all time points, including many genes associated with viral response, immune activation, antibody production, as well as genes associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and coronavirus GO terms and KEGG pathways. Calves presented DE genes associated with viral responses at 5 days pi as well as neurodegenerative-associated genes at 14 days pi. Both adults and calves showed predicted activation of the ISGF3 and IFN type I pathways at day 2 pi and, globally, increased activity related to the coronavirus pathway disease at 5 and 14 days pi.

The mechanisms underlying why only a subset of children develop this hyperinflammatory response remain unclear. Methods We performed an in-depth proteomic analysis of plasma samples from children before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those who developed MIS-C. Proteomic profiling was conducted using high-throughput technologies, and findings were validated using publicly available datasets. Results Healthy children showed minimal changes in the circulating proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of ongoing inflammation. In contrast, children with MIS-C exhibited significant activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and elevated circulating markers of myocardial and vascular injury. Conclusions Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection alone does not cause sustained proteomic alterations in most children. However, MIS-C is associated with a distinct inflammatory and vascular injury signature. Several candidate diagnostic biomarkers for MIS-C were identified and validated in silico, offering promising avenues for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="The emergence of human coronaviruses has led to three epidemics or pandemics in the last two decades, collectively causing millions of deaths and thus highlighting a long-term need to identify new antiviral drug targets and develop antiviral therapeutics. In this study, a compound library was screened to uncover novel potential inhibitors of coronavirus replication. Three lead compounds, designated #16-14, #16-23, and #16-24, which were Ixazomib and its analogs, were identified based on their potent antiviral activity and minimal cytotoxicity. These compounds were found to inhibit the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7, a target whose subcellular localization and expression are altered in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected Huh7 cells. Yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation further revealed that LMP7 interacts with the viral proteins Nsp13 and Nsp16. In addition, Nsp13 and Nsp16 disrupted the expression of LMP7 in response to pathogen attacks. Functional studies showed that LMP7 knockout in BEAS-2B-ACE2 cells resulted in enhanced replication of attenuated SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the role of this subunit in restricting viral replication. Taken together, these findings position LMP7 as a novel therapeutic target and highlight Ixazomib and its analogs as potential antiviral agents against current and future coronavirus threats.">

        <tr id="As an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits remarkable contagiousness and has emerged as a critical global public health concern. In critically ill patients, virus-induced cytokine storms and resulting multi-organ failure represent significant therapeutic challenges. In our clinical observations, we identified that this hyperinflammatory state was correlated with reduced mRNA expression of both Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-Induced Protein 8-like Protein 2 (TIPE2)—an immune negative modulator—and the ferroptosis marker gene Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of these patients. Given the emerging evidence that macrophage polarization and dysfunction play pivotal roles in COVID-19 progression, we established a THP-1-derived macrophage model stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to mimic the host immune response. Our results demonstrated that TIPE2 modulates S protein-induced macrophage polarization and ferroptosis, specifically by suppressing M1 polarization associated with inflammation and encouraging M2 polarization linked to anti-inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that TIPE2 mediates critical immunomodulatory effects during the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating pathological inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients gravely affected.

In this study, we asked whether SARS-CoV-2 (NY Iota strain) infection of astrocytes would result in cell-autonomous changes in Wnt/β-catenin pathway components. We report that induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived human astrocytes (iAs) are susceptible to sustained infection with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Real-time PCR revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of iAs decreased transcripts for Wnt3a, Wnt10b, and the downstream pathway effectors β-catenin and TCF3. Wnt7b was increased, as was the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10. No changes were noted in Wnt3, Wnt7a, TCF1, TCF4, or LEF1. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection differentially influences Wnt/β-catenin pathway components in astrocytes. These data could have implications for the mechanistic basis of COVID-19 and Long COVID.">

        <tr id="Significance Aging is a leading risk factor in influenza-related deaths. Additionally, the global population is aging at an unprecedented rate in human history, posing major issues for healthcare and the economy. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of severe influenza affecting older patients. Here, we found that highly elevated Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) expression with age drives extensive pulmonary mitophagy to attenuate type I interferon (IFN) response, leading to promotion of influenza virus replication and severe disease outcome. ApoD can therefore be a target for therapeutic intervention to protect against severe influenza virus infection in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="Vaccines played a crucial role in the COVID-19 pandemic, but their long-term biological effects and efficacy in vulnerable populations remain under intensive investigation. This study assessed clinical outcomes, comorbidities, and systemic biomarker and proteomic profiles in 366 multimorbid patients, stratified into four groups based on SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination status (COV+ vac+, COV+ vac−, COV− vac+, COV− vac−). Clinical and laboratory data, including comorbidities and relevant biomarkers, were collected. Proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry was performed to identify molecular changes associated with infection and vaccination. Statistical analyses examined associations between clinical status, biomarkers, and patient outcomes. As most participants received mRNA-based vaccines, the results primarily reflect responses to spike protein-expressing platforms. Biomarkers of cardiac and renal stress—namely proBNP and carbamide—were elevated in vaccinated individuals. Five deaths occurred in the COV+ vac+ group and two in the COV+ vac− group, most of which were attributed to exacerbations of pre-existing chronic diseases rather than to COVID-19 pneumonia. Protection against breakthrough infections waned over time, particularly beyond 200 days post-vaccination. Mass spectrometry identified proteins such as actin, fibrinogen chains, and SAA2 as potential diagnostic targets. Although the cross-sectional observational design limits the ability to draw causal inferences, the observed waning immunity and potential systemic alterations in vaccinated multimorbid patients highlight the importance of longitudinal follow-up to guide tailored immunization strategies and post-vaccination monitoring in high-risk groups.">

        <tr id="Neonatal pneumonia, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is frequently caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS). The mechanisms underlying protective immunity to this pathogen in the neonatal lung remain incompletely understood. Using a clinically relevant neonatal mouse model of GBS pneumonia, we investigated the immune mechanisms influencing disease severity. We demonstrate that neutrophils are effectively recruited to the lungs of infected neonates, but their phenotype differs with disease severity. In pups with moderate disease, we observe significant infiltration of SiglecFhi neutrophils, a phenotype associated with enhanced phagocytic capacity and bacterial clearance. In contrast, pups with severe disease failed to develop SiglecFhi neutrophils, resulting in reduced bacterial clearance and worsened pathology. We further show that severity is associated with increased expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the lungs. CGRP suppressed neutrophil activation into the SiglecFhi phenotype, thereby limiting their antibacterial function. Our findings show that GBS exploits the neuroimmune axis to evade host immunity through CGRP-mediated suppression of neutrophil activation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are crucial innate immune cells that play important roles during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Ex vivo human precision‐cut lung slices (PCLSs) are well‐suited models to study immune reactions and biochemical changes within host cells as well as to follow functional macrophage phenotype plasticity within complex tissue environment. Raman spectroscopy emerged in recent years as a powerful method for label‐free cell characterization. Methods Human PCLSs from one donor were infected with either the SARS‐CoV‐2 delta or omicron variant. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized AMs and virus particles. Cytokine levels of interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) and interleukin 18 (IL‐18) were quantified. The lung slice model was optimized for label‐free Raman spectroscopic imaging and for the characterization of single AMs within the three‐dimensional structure of the PCLS model. Results Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the location of AMs and virus particles within the PCLS model. Raman spectroscopic imaging generated false‐colour images, revealing distinct spectroscopic differences between AMs in the uninfected control PCLS model and those in PCLS models infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. These differences included variations in intracellular RNA, carotenoid, triacyl glyceride, and glucose levels, consistent in interpretation with cytokine quantification data. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification model achieved an 83% accuracy in distinguishing cells from infected lung slices from those of the uninfected controls. The LDA loadings pointed to spectral bands that had been previously identified in an in vitro stimulation study of macrophages. Conclusions Raman spectroscopy can characterize the cellular immune response and phenotype plasticity of AMs to infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 within a PCLS model in a label‐free and non‐invasive manner. The ability to distinguish cells from infected PCLSs from cells of the uninfected control PCLS based on intracellular biochemical changes highlights the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a powerful diagnostic tool in immunology and clinical diagnostics.">

This study investigated host autoreactivities in SARS-CoV-2 infections, their association with severe COVID-19, and the neutralizing antibody response. Circulating autoantibodies were detected in convalescent serum samples from unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Clustering, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and neural network modeling were used to explore the relationship between autoantibodies, hospitalization, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The presence of one autoantibody correlated with the detection of multiple others. Anti-IFNα antibodies were associated with elevated levels of anti-ENAs (extractable-nuclear antigen) but not with clinical outcome. COVID-19 hospitalization was significantly associated with the collective expression of autoantibodies targeting three ENAs: SSA/Ro52, Jo-1, and RNP. In contrast, autoantibodies targeting RNP/Sm, PCNA, Scl-70, and PL-12 were strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. In summary, this study has identified self-antigens targeted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and highlights a novel association between the autoantibody response and the antiviral humoral response.">

Those with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 5) were at high risk of severe disease faced a particularly heightened risk of severe illness. Inflammation and associated immune-thrombotic events in CKD stage 5 have attracted increasing attention, yet remain poorly understood. In this prospective cohort study, we examined and compared neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and low-density granulocytes (LDGs) in heathy controls (n = 15), CKD stage 5 patients without COVID-19 (n = 15), patients with COVID-19 (n = 15), and CKD stage 5 patients with COVID-19 (n = 90). Serum citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) and related gene expression (PAD4, ERK1, PKC), NET complexes, platelet factor 4 (PF4), von Willebrand factor (vWF), RANTES, and specific cytokines were quantified. Proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to assess the role of lipopolysaccharide-LDG complexes in NETs detected in COVID-19 plasma. NETs complexes were significantly higher in COVID-19 cases, and more so in patients with CKD stage 5D, and those who died. Disease severity was directly correlated with NETs complex levels (p = 0.016). CitH3 and gene expression levels were not correlated with advanced CKD stage, while levels of components that initiate NETs formation were higher in patients with COVID-19 and in CKD stage 5 patients. In conclusion, NET activation could partially explain the thrombotic manifestations in patients with COVID-19 and in CKD stage 5 patients.">

        <tr id="The non-polio enteroviruses enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) and enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71) are highly prevalent and considered pathogens of increasing health concern. While most enterovirus infections are mild and self-limiting, severe complications ranging from meningitis, encephalitis, to acute flaccid paralysis can occur, especially in children and immunocompromised patients. Despite the global burden of neurological complications caused by EV-D68 and EV-A71, the underlying neuropathogenesis remains poorly understood. In particular, the impact of the infection on neural function has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we compare the replication kinetics, cellular tropism, and electrophysiological effects of EV-D68 and EV-A71 infection in a physiologically relevant human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural co-culture model, consisting of excitatory neurons and astrocytes. Inoculation with contemporary circulating EV-D68 strains and an EV-A71 strain resulted in decreased neural activity in the co-cultures, with EV-D68 A2/2018 inducing the most rapid and robust negative effect on neural co-cultures, followed by EV-D68 B3/2019. EV-D68 strains preferentially infected neurons, whereas EV-A71 infection was detected in both cell types to the same extent. Despite the lack of viral release of infectious virus particles of EV-D68 B3/2019 in the supernatant, the infection could spread in the cultures and reduce neurotransmission. Higher viral load and broader tropism of EV-A71 did not result in enhanced impairment of neural function. Our results demonstrate that neurotropic non-polio enteroviruses lead to disruption of spontaneous neural activity in a virus-specific manner, which does not correlate with their replication efficiency.">

Since 2019, the scientific community has increasingly focused on exploring avenues for pandemic prevention and preparedness to enhance responses to future viral outbreaks. One such area of interest explores the use of additives, such as silicon nitride (Si₃N₄), in masks to enhance the antiviral properties of personal protective equipment. Si₃N₄ powder has been shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 under aqueous conditions, with a similar yet modest reduction in virus when embedded into non-woven fabric. This study aimed to optimize the use of Si₃N₄ as an antiviral agent. We addressed this knowledge gap by comparing the viral inactivation potential of β-Si₃N₄ and α-Si₃N₄ powders against multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Additionally, we tested a refined non-woven fabric embedded with α-Si₃N₄ against SARS-CoV-2 (Lineage A). The results presented here suggest that α-Si₃N₄ was the most effective in reducing the infectious virus through viral RNA degradation, as determined by plaque assay and RT-qPCR. The most promising finding was the significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 after only 10 min of exposure to refined α-Si₃N₄-embedded fabric. Thus, silicon nitride could be an invaluable inorganic additive in personal protective equipment during future viral epidemics and pandemics.">

        <tr id="Long COVID (LC), also known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection (PASC), is a heterogeneous and debilitating chronic disease that currently affects 10 to 20 million people in the U.S. and over 420 million people globally. With no approved treatments, the long-term global health and economic impact of chronic LC remains high and growing. LC affects children, adolescents, and healthy adults and is characterized by over 200 diverse symptoms that persist for months to years after the acute COVID-19 infection is resolved. These symptoms target twelve major organ systems, causing dyspnea, vascular damage, cognitive impairments (“brain fog”), physical and mental fatigue, anxiety, and depression. This heterogeneity of LC symptoms, along with the lack of specific biomarkers and diagnostic tests, presents a significant challenge to the development of LC treatments. While several biological abnormalities have emerged as potential drivers of LC, a causative factor in a large subset of patients with LC, involves reservoirs of virus and/or viral RNA (vRNA) that persist months to years in multiple organs driving chronic inflammation, respiratory, muscular, cognitive, and cardiovascular damages, and provide continuous viral antigenic stimuli that overstimulate and exhaust CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In this review, we (i) shed light on persisting virus and vRNA reservoirs detected, either directly (from biopsy, blood, stool, and autopsy samples) or indirectly through virus-specific B and T cell responses, in patients with LC and their association with the chronic symptomatology of LC; (ii) explore potential mechanisms of inflammation, immune evasion, and immune overstimulation in LC; (iii) review animal models of virus reservoirs in LC; (iv) discuss potential T cell immunotherapeutic strategies to reduce or eliminate persistent virus reservoirs, which would mitigate chronic inflammation and alleviate symptom severity in patients with LC.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) is a highly virulent pathogen responsible for chronic infections such as osteomyelitis. Although its interaction with the host immune system has been widely studied, the specific role of inflammasomes in regulating the infection within macrophages remains unclear. We investigated this question using bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with S. aureus and observed a significant reduction in intracellular bacterial load beginning at 18 hours post-infection (hpi), which continued through 96 hpi. Notably, robust activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—including inflammasome assembly, IL-1β and GSDMD maturation, and pyroptosis—occurred only after 18 hpi. This led us to hypothesize that S. aureus suppresses inflammasome activation during early infection.

        <tr id="Chikungunya fever (CF), caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), is characterized by disabling symptoms such as joint pain that can last for months. Monocytes play a central role in immune modulation and viral replication during infection. This study evaluated the clinical and immunological profiles of patients with laboratory-confirmed CF. Fever and joint pain were the most frequently reported symptoms, whereas edema was more common in women. CHIKV-infect individuals exhibited increased TLR4 expression in non-classical monocytes (CD14+CD16++). Additionally, intermediate (CD14+CD16+) and non-classical (CD14+CD16++) monocytes expressing TLR7 were enriched during the acute phase and in some chronic patients, thereby suggest prolonged TLR7 pathway activation. Levels of soluble CD163 (sCD163)—a marker of monocyte/macrophage activation—were elevated as well, indicating sustained immune activation. Coagulation-related mediators—including Tissue factor (TF) and Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)—also increased, despite the rarity of hemorrhagic events or thrombocytopenia. Patients with arthritis demonstrated higher frequencies of TLR7+ intermediate monocytes and elevated Epidermal growth factor (EGF) levels, whereas those with edema exhibit increased Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Overall, these findings highlighted the differential activation of CD16+ monocytes and suggested that sCD163 is a marker of monocyte/macrophage activation during CHIKV infection.">

        <tr id="Background: PDLIM2, a PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein expressed highest in the lung and immune cells, serves as a unique tumor suppressor and immune modulator, mainly by turning off the activation of the master transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3. While its role in cancer is established, the involvement of PDLIM2 in viral infection remains unclear. Results: Here, we analyzed public gene expression data of blood leukocytes, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and lung tissues from uninfected healthy humans and those infected with the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We found that PDLIM2 expression was repressed by viral infection, and notably, this repression correlated with the severity of infectious diseases. Consistently, the expression level of PDLIM2 was negatively associated with NF-κB and STAT3 activity across a diverse range of cell types, such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, alveolar type 1 and 2 epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. Accordingly, cells with low PDLIM2 expression exhibited aberrant activation of signaling pathways essential for cellular functions and immune responses. Conclusions: These findings highlight PDLIM2 repression as a common mechanism underlying human viral infectious diseases and suggest PDLIM2 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for disease prognosis, prevention, and treatment.">

Comparing B cell responses in the upper respiratory tract following vaccination and infection may offer unique insights into mucosal immunity. Here, we characterized antigen-specific B cells in the tonsils, adenoids, and peripheral blood of children who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. SARS-CoV-2-specific switched memory B cells (BSM) and germinal center B cells were found in the blood and pharyngeal lymphoid tissues after vaccination or infection. However, infection generated a higher proportion of IgA+ BSM and CXCR3+CD21+ BSM, which showed distinct spatial localization, greater clonal expansion and increased propensity for plasma cell differentiation compared to their CXCR3− counterparts, accompanied by persistent activation of innate and T follicular helper cells in the tissues. Our data provide evidence for tissue-specific B cell memory after either SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection, but with distinct characteristics that can influence the quality, durability, and localization of immunity.">

However, the specific mechanisms by which TLR7 activation shapes SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses, particularly via IRF-IFN pathways, remain incompletely elucidated. This review synthesizes current findings on how intrinsic TLR7-driven IFN signaling influences viral clearance, modulates adaptive immunity, and contributes to autoantibody production in COVID-19. A deeper understanding of these processes is essential for developing targeted therapeutic interventions and improved vaccines aimed at mitigating severe COVID-19 and preventing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).">

        <tr id="Understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cancer patients remains a critical priority given their immunocompromised status. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated humoral and cellular immunity across three time points—baseline, post-second dose, and post-booster—in 23 breast cancer patients undergoing active treatment. IgG antibody levels showed a significant increase following vaccination, with a 300-fold rise after the second dose and a 2200-fold increase post-booster, indicating a strong humoral response. CD19+ B cells also increased significantly, supporting B cell-mediated activation. Although overall T cell frequencies remained stable, we observed a shift toward memory phenotypes, with decreased naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased central and peripheral memory subsets after the booster. Notably, CD8+ TEMRA cells expanded significantly, suggesting cytotoxic memory formation. Correlation analyses linked peripheral memory CD4+ T cells with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, while CD8+ TEMRA cells showed an inverse association. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response was evaluated using APC-labeled MHC I Dextramer reagents. After the booster, 55.5% of patients developed detectable antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, whereas 44.5% did not. Importantly, one patient who failed to develop antigen-specific CD8+ T cells experienced a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the absence of this response may increase susceptibility despite high IgG levels. These findings indicate that antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and antibody levels may act as complementary but not directly correlated arms of immunity. Microbiota profiling via sPLS-DA suggested weak but distinct microbial signatures associated with immune responsiveness, particularly enrichment of taxa such as Alistipes and Romoutsia among high-antibody responders. These findings emphasize that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is immunogenic and well tolerated in breast cancer patients under therapy and highlight the need to further explore microbiota–immune interactions to optimize vaccination strategies in oncology.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 7 million deaths, but its legacy extends beyond mortality. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces immune alterations that persist post-recovery, manifesting not only in long COVID (LC) but also in healthy individuals. Cytokines serve as critical orchestrators of these processes. The goal of this study is to investigate post-pandemic immune remodeling through cytokine assessment in both patients with LC and healthy donor, and to compare the post-pandemic population with pre-pandemic controls to find changes in the immune responses and cytokine profiles. A panel of 47 immune mediators (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) was measured with the MAGPIX multiplex analysis. LC was characterized by an increase in IL-7, IL-8, IL-17F, IL-18, EGF, FGF-2, PDGF-AA, sCD40L, and MCP-3 and a decrease in IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, IL-27, and FLT-3L. Comparing post-pandemic recovered individuals with pre-pandemic healthy cohort, we saw an upregulation of IL-13 and MCP-3 and a downregulation of MDC, M-CSF, IL-12, and IL-17F. While LC is characterized by persistent immune imbalance—particularly in cytokine networks—our data emphasize the critical need to study healthy donors in both pre- and post-pandemic eras when analyzing and interpreting these changes.">

Pathological examination and serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were assessed. Messenger ribonucleic acid-sequence was used to analyze the transcriptomic changes in tissues. Multiple inflammatory cytokines in tissues and inflammatory cells in the blood were detected on the fifth day post-infection. Our results showed that H1N1 infection caused significant liver pathology and elevated serum AST/ALT levels. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in liver gene expression profiles following H1N1 infection, particularly in genes associated with inflammatory responses, including those involved in monocyte adhesion/activation and neutrophil/macrophage infiltration. Marked increases in inflammatory mediators were observed in lungs, serum, and liver, accompanied by systemic changes in circulating inflammatory cells, indicating H1N1 triggered a robust systemic inflammatory response. These findings suggest that H1N1-induced liver damage may be associated with the systemic inflammatory response induced by H1N1 and changes in liver gene regulation.">

        <tr id="Background: Currently available immunological tests for SARS-CoV-2 assess only antibody responses. Despite the growing evidence that T cells play a crucial role in protection, especially against emerging viral variants, no routine test is available to determine T cell immunity. The prognostic value of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for determining whether individuals are immune and protected against disease remains uncertain. This is in part due to the following: (a) specificity and limitations such as the sensitivity of antibody tests, and (b) the lack of correlation between antibody titers (quantity) and the antiviral function of antibodies (quality). Approximately a quarter of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with symptoms fail to show seroconversion in serological assays. Methods: The current report describes the development and application of a whole-blood-based assay to detect previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Whole blood is stimulated with SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides identified during assay development and stimulation-induced cytokines quantified using a multiplex testing platform. The resulting cytokine profiles are generated using computational tools to identify previous exposure to the virus. Results: The application of the assay revealed a lack of self-awareness of individuals’ COVID-19 infection history and demonstrated the value of this new assay to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure history and immunity in populations. Conclusions: Positive responses in this assay can facilitate the identification of underlying causes of unexplained symptoms and provide clinically actionable insights for healthcare applications, including in the continued conundrum of post-acute sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC or “long COVID”), for which both diagnosis and management remain challenging.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a profound global impact, yet children exhibited distinct clinical and epidemiological patterns compared to adults. Pediatric cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were generally characterized by milder disease, lower hospitalization rates, and few long-term sequelae. However, a subset of children developed severe complications such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), highlighting the heterogeneity in disease presentation. Differences in immune system maturity and comorbidities likely contribute to the age-dependent manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, has been implicated in the emergence of new viral variants with immune escape characteristics due to ongoing viral replication in the presence of selective pressure. While SARS-CoV-2 evolution in persistently infected adults has been well-documented, it is less clear how the virus evolves during persistent infection in the pediatric population. To address this question, we performed viral whole genome sequencing of longitudinal specimens collected from immunocompetent and immunocompromised pediatric COVID-19 patients. Similarly to what has been observed in adult cohorts, mutations associated with enhanced viral fitness and immune escape arose intra-host over time. Intra-host diversity accumulated at similar rates in immunocompetent and immunocompromised children, though more mutations overall were observed in the immunocompromised cohort due to the longer infection time courses. Overall, we identified similar viral evolutionary trends over the course of infection despite clinical differences in pediatric COVID-19 manifestation and severity. This similarity suggests that persistent infection in children may be an additional, but not unique, source of ongoing viral diversification.">

Our previous study showed a 22% median increase in homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in obese individuals at 12 months post-infection compared to acute infection. This study aimed to investigate the association between various subsets of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8 + T cells and insulin resistance in convalescent COVID-19 patients over a one-year post-infection follow-up period. A nested case control study of 47 COVID-19 patients was followed for 12 months post-infection and categorized into three groups based on obesity and changes in HOMA-IR at one year: non-obese without increased HOMA-IR (NO), obese without increased HOMA-IR (O), and obese with increased HOMA-IR (O-IR). Increased HOMA-IR was defined as a HOMA-IR ratio (12-month to 1-month convalescence phase) > 1.21. To study antigen-specific responses, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s were isolated and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide antigens for 24 h. Intracellular IFN-γ expression, as well as exhaustion and senescence markers, in various CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. The abundance of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells was lower in the O-IR group compared to individuals without increased HOMA-IR during the 9th to 12th months of follow-up (p < 0.05). Conversely, the O-IR group exhibited a mild but significantly higher IFN-γ-expressing CD8+ T cells from the 3rd to the 9th month of the convalescence phase (p < 0.05). A reduced proportion of functional (PD-1−CD57−) SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed in O-IR group. Furthermore, the reduced proportion of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells observed within 12 months of convalescence were have significant weak negative correlation with HOMA-IR ratio as well as HOMA-IR value. Our study demonstrates that obese individuals with increased HOMA-IR exhibited a reduced proportion of IFN-γ–expressing functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells one year after COVID-19. This reduction, along with the decreased frequencies of both functional CD4⁺ within 12 months of convalescence, suggests a potential association between impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell function and the development of insulin resistance following COVID-19. These findings warrant further investigation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-11714-3.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), remains a major global health threat due to prolonged treatment and drug-resistant strains. Host-directed therapy (HDT), which modulates host-pathogen interactions, offers potential to shorten treatment and limit resistance. This study investigates the effects of Scutellarin (SCU), a flavonoid from Scutellaria baicalensis, on Mtb-infected macrophages within the HDT framework. Methods: Anti-pyroptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of SCU were assessed in Mtb-infected THP-1 and J774A.1 macrophages, and in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by oxygen consumption rate(OCR), membrane potential, and superoxide levels; glycolytic activity was measured by proton efflux rate (GlycoPER). Expression of inflammasome-related markers was analyzed by Western blot, qPCR, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. The role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) was examined via siRNA knockdown. Results: SCU inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, reduced IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, and attenuating pyroptosis. It restored mitochondrial integrity by regulating p-DRP1, MFN2, and Cytochrome C expression, and suppressed HIF-1α-mediated glycolytic reprogramming. Silencing of HIF-1α confirmed its role in SCU’s mechanism. In vivo, SCU reduced pulmonary inflammation and cytokine release in LPS-induced ALI. Conclusion: SCU alleviates Mtb-induced pyroptosis and inflammation in macrophages by inhibiting the HIF-1α-mediated Warburg effect.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal meningitis is a fungal infection in patients with compromised CD4 T cell function. CD4 T cells provide killing signals to macrophages, principally IFNγ, to limit intracellular fungal replication. However, CD4 T cells may also drive inflammatory tissue damage. Yet, it is not fully understood how fungal-specific CD4 T cells infiltrate the brain and how they influence functional phenotypes of CNS-resident myeloid cells. In the current work, we develop a mouse model to track fungal-specific CD4 T cells and determine their influence on microglia. We found IFNγ+ fungal-specific CD4 T cells have limited TCR signalling and characterise a population of inflammatory microglia that upregulate MHCII and IFNγ-regulated genes during infection. Inflammatory microglia have poor fungicidal capacity and significantly expand during infection, a process that depends on CD4 T cell infiltration. Taken together, these data identify the early inflammatory consequences of fungal-specific CD4 T cell infiltration and identify proliferating microglia as important drivers of brain inflammation during infection.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has converged with the HIV epidemic. Although immunocompromised patients show an elevated risk of death due to COVID-19 compared to HIV infection, the impact remains contradictory. One reason could be the use of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Patients with HIV receiving ARV, such as tenofovir (TDF), have fewer symptoms of COVID-19. In mice, bleomycin (BLM) induces acute lung injury, resulting in an acute inflammatory response similar to the cytokine storm and lung damage observed in COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the preventive role of TDF administration prior to BLM administration. A total of 64 eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, France), both male and female, were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n = 8 per sex per group): (i) oral TDF administered in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by oropharyngeal aspiration (OA) of saline on day 7 (TDF); (ii) oral TDF in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (TDF-BLM); (iii) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of saline on day 7 (SAL); and (iv) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (BLM). Animals were euthanized 72 h after OA (day 10), and serum and lung tissues were collected for analysis. TDF-BLM lungs showed significantly reduced bronchioalveolar lavage fluid total cell counts, specifically reduced macrophages and neutrophils counts, but an increased presence of minority lymphocytes. TDF downregulated BLM-induced levels of Il1β, Il6, TNFα, and Tgfβ mRNA. Preventive treatment with TDF counteracted BLM-induced alveolar and bronchiolar cell damage. Male mice showed more severe symptoms after BLM administration for most parameters, and the preventive action of TDF was similar in both sexes. Preventive TDF administration partially counteracted BLM-induced acute lung injury. These findings support epidemiological observations suggesting a potential benefit of TDF as a prophylactic therapy against COVID-19, at least in HIV-infected patients.">

        <tr id="A 48-year-old patient underwent lung transplantation because of severe COVID-19, which aggravated his underlying interstitial lung disease, despite the presence of detectable SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, the graft is re-infected early in the post-procedural phase, leading to viral persistence for more than five months. By analyzing viral evolution and effector immune response within the transplanted organ, we observe three main findings. First, virus evolution differs in the transplanted organ compared to that in the upper respiratory tract and is affected by monoclonal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and molnupiravir. Second, we show the potential clinical relevance of T cell HLA restriction that may facilitate viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract compared to the ongoing viral replication in the HLA mismatch organ. Third, close monitoring and modulation of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy enables viral clearance in a lung transplantation setting despite incomplete SARS-CoV-2 clearance prior to transplantation.">

        <tr id="ntroduction. Recent studies have convincingly demonstrated the ability of the SARS-CоV-2 coronavirus pathogen to exacerbate the severity of cardiovascular diseases through the formation of cardiorespiratory pathology, partly due to endothelial injury. Purpose. To determine the impact of cardiovascular disease on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection in patients residing in southern Iraq. Materials and methods. An analysis of 120 blood samples from patients residing was conducted to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection in patients with cardiovascular disease manifestations and in patients with no confirmed cardiovascular pathology. A high-tech research method, the quantitative PCR (qPCR), was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. Results. The study found 95 positive and 25 negative samples for SARS-CoV-2. The positive blood samples contained RdRp, E, and N genes, and the cycle threshold (CT) depended on their identification. The highest number of positive samples was detected in autumn and in the first month of winter, mainly in patients aged 19–27, 64–72, and 73–81. A higher prevalence of viral infection was observed among women and patients with ventricular septal defects. Conclusion. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is influenced by patients’ age and the presence of clinical manifestations of cardiovascular pathology. The data obtained serve as a basis for planning further studies aimed at analyzing the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify the strains identified in this study.
 Введение. Исследованиями последних лет показана способность возбудителя коронавирусной инфекции SARS-CoV-2 усугублять тяжесть течения сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний вследствие формирования кардиореспираторной патологии, отчасти за счет поражения эндотелия. Цель. Определить влияние сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний на частоту встречаемости коронавирусной инфекции SARS-CoV-2 у пациентов, проживающих на юге Ирака, в зависимости от их возраста и пола. Материалы и методы. Осуществлен анализ 120 образцов крови пациентов, проживающих в провинции Ти-Кар на юге Ирака, на предмет выявления наличия коронавирусной инфекции SARS-CoV-2 у пациентов с проявлениями сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний и у пациентов с отсутствием констатированной сердечно-сосудистой патологии. Для выявления SARS-CoV-2 использован высокотехнологичный метод исследования – количественной ПЦР (qPCR). Результаты. По результатам исследования выявлено 95 положительных (в отношении вируса SARS-CoV-2) образцов, 25 образцов были отрицательными. В положительных образцах крови обнаружены гены RdRp, E и N, а порог цикла (CT) зависел от их идентификации. Наибольшее количество положительных проб выявлено в осенний период и первый месяц зимнего периода времени, преимущественно у пациентов в возрасте 19–27, 64–72 и 73–81 года. Большее носительство вирусной инфекции наблюдалось среди женщин и пациентов с дефектами межжелудочковой перегородки. Заключение. На инфицированность SARS-CoV-2 влияет возраст пациентов и наличие у них клинических проявлений сердечно-сосудистой патологии. Полученные данные служат основой для планирования выполнения дальнейших исследований, направленных на анализ всего генома SARS-CoV-2 для выявления его штаммов, идентифицированных в данном исследовании.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, spread rapidly across the globe in 2020, with most countries experiencing two distinct waves of infection. In Brazil, the second wave was marked by the emergence of the P.1 (Gamma) variant, which disproportionately affected younger individuals and was associated with increased mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological profile and post mortem histopathological lung findings, correlate them with laboratory results, and compare the first and second waves of COVID-19. To investigate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), we performed immunohistochemistry for citrullinated histone H3 (cit-H3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Our cohort included patients who died in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a single center in southern Brazil. The study included 42 patients, 24 from the first wave and 18 from the second, who died between March 2020 and August 2021. Laboratory data included complete blood counts and D-dimer levels. Histopathological analyses were conducted using H&E-stained slides and reviewed independently by two blinded pathologists. MPO and cit-H3 immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate NETs markers. All cases exhibited varying degrees of inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), with frequent microvascular thrombi. Neutrophilic infiltration was significantly higher in the second wave. Additionally, cases with intense neutrophilic infiltration showed a stronger association with thrombosis. NETs were identified in 10 cases. No significant correlation was found between histopathological findings, NETs, and laboratory blood count results. The histopathological findings were consistent with those reported globally. The second wave of COVID-19 showed higher neutrophilic infiltrate in the lung tissue. Neutrophils play a key role in the inflammatory response and NET formation might indicate an increased risk of mortality. Further studies can consider NET-targeted therapies as potential strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a notable resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) in children, with a concerning rise in the severity of cases. Although changes in post-pandemic respiratory infection patterns have been documented, the reasons behind the increased severity of MPP, especially concerning shifts in the respiratory microbiota, are not well understood. This study aims to explore how pandemic-associated disruptions in respiratory microbiota contribute to MPP severity. Through analysis of multiple independent cohorts, we found that the depletion of protective respiratory microbiota exacerbates MPP severity by reducing colonization resistance against M. pneumoniae. We identified two antagonistic microbiota modules with distinct metabolic features and community structures that regulate pathogen colonization and disease severity. Using a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, we simulated M. pneumoniae infection dynamics across different microbiota states. Additionally, a machine-learning model based on eight key microbes effectively distinguished between cases and controls and predicted infection severity, offering insights into post-pandemic respiratory infections. This study underscores the essential role of the respiratory microbiota in influencing the severity of M. pneumoniae infections. Our findings offer a framework for managing respiratory infections in the post-pandemic era, highlighting the significance of understanding microbial community dynamics in determining disease outcomes. These insights could guide the development of therapeutic strategies focused on restoring or enhancing the protective microbiota, which may offer an effective strategy for the management of MPP and other respiratory infections.">

        <tr id="Background Breakthrough infections are defined as SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring ≥ 14 days after completing the primary COVID-19 vaccination series and remain a public health challenge, particularly in regions where immune-evasive variants are circulating. However, data on their virological and clinical profiles in low-resource settings are limited. Methods This retrospective study was conducted from July to December 2022 in Accra, Ghana, among individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for the nucleocapsid (N), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), and envelope (E) genes, categorised as < 25, 25–30, or > 30. Variant identification targeted Alpha, Delta, and Omicron mutations using mutation-specific RT-PCR. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between vaccination status and demographic, clinical, and virological factors. Results Of the 268 samples analysed, 81 tested positive; 43.20% [n = 35] were vaccinated individuals. Median Ct-values for the N [27.13, IQR: 21.59–31.96] and E [24.57, IQR: 19.43–29.43] genes were significantly higher among vaccinated cases, indicating lower viral loads. Breakthrough infections were strongly associated with the Omicron variant [aOR = 4.38, p = 0.034]. Diarrhoea [aOR = 9.67, p = 0.022], sore throat [aOR = 8.99, p = 0.038], headache [aOR = 10.156, p = 0.039] and chills [aOR = 3.316, p = 0.046] were mostly associated with breakthrough infections. Ct-values of 25–30 [aOR = 11.33, p = 0.012] and > 30 [aOR = 4.01, p = 0.047] were significantly associated with breakthrough infection compared to Ct < 25 in breakthrough infections. Conclusion Vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection had lower viral loads and were more likely to be infected with the Omicron variant. These findings reinforce the role of vaccination in reducing viral load and support the adoption of practical surveillance strategies, such as Ct value-based surveillance and variant screening in low middle-income countries facing similar constraints in genomic capacity and vaccine deployment.

These pathological processes have the potential to dysregulate critical cellular pathways, thereby promoting cancer development in vulnerable populations. A thorough understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the development of gastrointestinal cancer is essential for optimizing patient care and establishing comprehensive, long-term monitoring protocols.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a 1.7-fold higher arrhythmia risk with rates of cardiac complications ranging from 2% non-ICU patients to 59% in non-survivors. Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is a frequent complication of acute and long COVID-19. The high expression of ACE2 in the heart suggested that infectious virus may underlie cardiac complications. However, we recently reported in human cardiac tissue from fatal COVID-19 cases perivascular spike protein, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, vascular damage, and cardiac remodeling without evidence for direct infection of cardiac cells by SARS-CoV2. Mislocalization of intercalated disc (ID) components, connexin-43 (Cx43) gap junctions and NaV1.5 sodium channels, was also evident in patients’ hearts, recapitulating structural remodeling we previously identified as providing a substrate for atrial arrhythmias following an acute inflammatory insult. Therefore, we hypothesized that the inflammatory response elicited by SARS-CoV2 spike protein is sufficient to provoke atrial arrhythmias. Structural and functional assessments of WT murine hearts were performed five days following a single bolus intravenous injection of the viral spike protein. In vivo ECGs demonstrated increased atrial arrhythmia burden in spike-injected mice vs. control. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed elevated expression of inflammatory markers and evidence of vascular damage in these mice. Additionally, we observed disruption of ID ultrastructure and mislocalization of Cx43 and NaV1.5 in the atria of spike protein-injected mice. Our results suggest that vascular-leak inducing inflammatory insult from viral spike protein, and not direct infection by SARS-CoV2 results in the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in fatal COVID-19.

        <tr id="Background Growing evidence indicates that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gammaherpesvirus, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The presence of EBV-infected cells in the central nervous system (CNS) of MS patients, but not in neurologically healthy individuals, suggests that viral persistence in the CNS may drive MS. However, why there is such a long interval between initial infection and the development of disease is unknown. Methods To model the effects of EBV infection on the brain, we intracerebrally infected mice with murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV68), a virus genetically related to EBV that causes transient pathology strikingly similar to that seen in humans after acute EBV infection. One month following MHV68 infection, we administered myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide to evaluate the effects of prior MHV68 infection on the response to an additional inflammatory stimulus of the CNS. Virus persistence, microglial activation and immune cell infiltration were evaluated over time using flow cytometry. Results Intracerebral MHV68 infection induced mild brain demyelination and ataxia, a common symptom of MS, that both quickly resolved. However, administration of MOG peptide one month later led to more severe brain demyelination and more sustained ataxia, suggesting that prior MHV68 infection sensitized the mice to a newly introduced immune stimulus. Further investigation revealed that following CNS infection, MHV68 persisted in microglia, where it induced a primed phenotype marked by elevated MHC-II expression and heightened immune reactivity for at least six months. Primed microglia displayed increases in the labile iron pool, and iron chelation reduced microglial priming. Early antiviral treatment during MHV68 infection completely prevented subsequent MOG-induced demyelinating disease. Conclusions These findings support a two-step mechanism by which CNS infection with a gammaherpesvirus closely related to EBV sensitizes the host to a second unrelated immune stimulus that triggers MS-like disease manifestations. Chronic priming of microglia resulting from the initial infection contributes to this process, and prevention of such priming with early antiviral treatment also prevents neuropathology following the second stimulus. EBV infection may similarly sensitize humans to a second stimulus and, if so, treatment of acute EBV infection may avert subsequent MS development.

        <tr id="Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted investigation into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in lung cancer patients. Understanding this interplay is crucial for optimizing cancer immunotherapy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on lung cancer patients, characterizing changes in peripheral immune cells and plasma cytokines (including IL-10 and IL-12p70) before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between ICI-treated patients with and without COVID-19. Cytokine dynamics were further analyzed in a non-infected cohort. Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a prolonged systemic cytokine storm, with elevated IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels and reduced monocyte proportions lasting up to 10 weeks post-recovery. Despite this immune perturbation, COVID-19 did not impair long-term PFS; instead, a transient improvement in disease control was observed in infected patients. In non-infected patients, sustained or increased IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels during ICI therapy were associated with longer PFS (p < 0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection transiently alters the immune landscape in lung cancer patients without compromising ICI efficacy. The sustained elevation of IL-10 and IL-12p70 may contribute to short-term clinical benefits. Monitoring cytokine dynamics could serve as a prognostic tool for predicting ICI response.">

        <tr id="Background Toscana virus (TOSV), a sandfly-borne phlebovirus, is a frequent cause of viral meningitis and meningoencephalitis in Mediterranean countries during summer months. Clinical outcomes vary from self-limited disease to prolonged persistent infection lasting over 3 months, but the mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. In this study, we compared the pathobiological features of two clinical TOSV strains, SI-1812 (associated with self-limited disease) and INMI (associated with persistent infection), using human neural models. Methods Three human neural systems, DBTRG.05MG glioblastoma cells, embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, and human brain organoids (hBOs), were infected with the two TOSV strains. Viral replication, cytopathic effect, innate immune response, and viral protein expression were assessed. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing was performed to identify strain-specific differences. Results The INMI strain showed reduced replication and cytopathic effect compared to SI-1812, supporting persistent infection in hBOs for up to 21 days. SI-1812 infection triggered a strong interferon-β response even at early stages of infection and low viral titers, whereas INMI induced a modest innate immune response in the early stages of infection, likely supporting its persistence in hBOs. The timing of viral NSs protein expression differred between the two viral strains suggesting distinct mechanisms in RIG-I activation and inflammatory response modulation. Conclusions Distinct host-pathogen interactions underlie the divergent clinical courses of TOSV strains. The findings provide insights into mechanisms of viral persistence in the human brain and may guide future therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel member of the Coronaviridae family. The viral genome encodes both structural proteins, such as spike, membrane, hemagglutinin, and envelope, as well as non-structural proteins that include auxiliary proteins and replicase essential for viral replication. While immunization campaigns have mitigated the spread of the virus, therapeutic interventions remain critical for managing outbreaks and preventing long-term health consequences. Despite extensive global research into the genome, structure, entry process, and replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, key aspects such as the roles of membrane lipids in viral entry, packaging, and release, as well as the metabolic alterations in infected cells, remain poorly understood. Epigenetics, the study of heritable phenotypic changes driven by genetic and non-genetic factors, plays a pivotal role in shaping host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone methylation and acetylation, DNA and RNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation, significantly influence gene expression in infected host cells. These reversible changes orchestrate the host’s antiviral responses and potentially alter susceptibility to COVID-19. This review delves into the immuno-epigenetic modifications occurring in hosts infected with SARS-CoV-2, providing insights into how these changes trigger viral replication and infection processes. By examining the current state of research on the immune-epigenetic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we highlight the mechanisms by which these modifications affect the host-viral interplay. Furthermore, we propose potential therapeutic targets within the immune-epigenetic pathways that could enhance ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms will not only provide a deeper perspective on the virus’s pathogenic strategies but also offer innovative approaches to improve therapeutic interventions. By addressing the gaps in knowledge surrounding immune-epigenetic factors, this review aims to contribute to the development of novel strategies for preventing and managing coronavirus infections and its variants.">

        <tr id="Subclinical parasitemia constitutes the predominant proportion of Plasmodium spp. infections in hyperendemic regions of the world. Elevated levels of serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) are observed in both acute symptomatic and chronic subclinical Plasmodium spp. infections. The role of IL-10 in acute infection has been extensively studied; however, the role of sustained elevated levels of IL-10 in chronic subclinical plasmodial infections remains to be determined. We investigated the role of IL-10 in a long-term subclinical and patent Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi-AS (Pc) infection using mice lacking humoral immunity (µMT-/- mice). Pc-infected µMT-/- mice exhibit a long-term (99 days) chronic infection, with microscopic levels of parasitemia and without any outward signs of disease. We found that chronically infected mice have slightly elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon-γ (IFNγ), and high levels of IL-10 in the circulation. The source of IL-10 was CD4+ T cells. We found that elevated IL-10 levels were mechanistically linked to subclinical Plasmodium infection by blocking IL-10 signaling. Anti-IL-10R resulted in a marked, albeit transient, reduction of the parasitemia that was accompanied by a robust pro-inflammatory response and death of chronically infected µMT-/- mice. A similar outcome was observed in infected µMT-/- mice after CD4+ T cell depletion with anti-CD4 antibody. CD4-depleted infected µMT-/- mice exhibited reduced IL-10 and rapid weight loss, succumbing to infection by day 6 after CD4 neutralization. Our results showed that IL-10 from CD4+ T cells limits immune-mediated pathology in chronic subclinical Pc infection in µMT-/- mice by protecting against excessive inflammatory responses to blood-stage parasites.">

        <tr id="Cell cultures are widely used to study infectious respiratory diseases and to test therapeutics; however, they do not faithfully recapitulate the architecture and complexity of the human respiratory tract. Lung organoids have emerged as an alternative model that partially overcomes this key disadvantage. Lung organoids can be cultured in various formats that offer potential for studying highly pathogenic viruses. However, the effects of these different formats on virus infection remain unexplored, leaving their relative value unclear. In this study, we generated primary lung organoids from human donor cells and used them to derive monolayers and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with the goal of comparing the replication kinetics of two circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection studies revealed that organoid-derived monolayers displayed limited infection, and the innate immune response was impaired against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not against virus-like double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or poly(I:C). Meanwhile, organoids and organoid-derived ALI cultures retained viral permissivity, with ALI cultures displaying diverse antiviral immune responses against both coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV demonstrated differential replication kinetics in organoid and organoid-derived ALI cultures. Therefore, primary organoid-derived cells in two-dimensional monolayer or three-dimensional ALI formats influence virus infection and host antiviral responses. Our study informs the selection of culture conditions for organoid-based respiratory disease research and therapeutic testing.


IMPORTANCE
The COVID-19 pandemic heralded the upsurge in human-derived lung organoid-based studies due to their cellular heterogeneity that partly emulates the cellular complexity of the respiratory tract. A major disadvantage of organoid models resides in their apical-in conformation that "hides" cells and proteins that are typically exposed to the air-liquid interface (ALI) in the airways and are targets of viruses. Here, we generated monolayers and ALI cultures to facilitate cell exposure to highly relevant pathogens and compared them to parental organoids. Organoids at the ALI captured infection and immune responses better than organoids and organoid-derived monolayer cultures. Organoids at the ALI are a viable approach to improve identification and characterization of virus infection, host responses, and therapeutic testing.">

        <tr id="Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus capable of causing neurological and immunological symptoms in humans, yet its effects on neural/immune systems remain insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to examine SINV replication, UV-C light inactivation, apoptosis induction, and immune gene modulation in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Following viral adaptation and infectious dose determination, SINV replication and inactivation were assessed using RT-qPCR and dsRNA immunofluorescence. Apoptotic markers (caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2) were analyzed by immunofluorescence and immune genes expression kinetics (TLR3/7, RIGI, MDA5, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, IL-10, IFNβ and β-catenin) were measured at defined time points post-infection by RT-qPCR. SH-SY5Y cells supported productive SINV infection, with viral RNA detectable as early as 3 hpi and marked cytopathic effects by 24 hpi. A custom-built UV-C chamber achieved complete viral inactivation following 3 × 30 s exposures. We observed SINV time-course replication and UV-C inactivation with conspicuous morphological alterations in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, SINV triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis and robust transcriptional upregulation of innate immune genes, peaking between 12–16 hpi and declining by 30 hpi. These findings elucidate the temporal dynamics of SINV replication, cell death mechanisms, and immune activation in a neuronal context, contributing to a better understanding of SINV neuropathogenesis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Immune induction under B‐cell depletion is complex and far from being fully understood. Methods We investigated clinical and immunological responses after dual homologous mRNA vaccination with BNT162b2 and after booster vaccination or infection in 14 B‐cell depleted patients with inflammatory central nervous system disease in comparison to 28 healthy controls. Spike‐specific IgG were determined using ELISA and neutralizing activity by surrogate assay. Reactive T cells were flow‐cytometrically analyzed after spike‐specific and polyclonal stimulation. Reactogenicity was self‐reported using a questionnaire. Results Vaccination was well tolerated, with slightly more systemic events reported by patients. Spike‐specific antibodies were induced in all controls, but only 43% of patients with significantly lower IgG levels and reduced neutralizing capacity (p < 0.0001). In contrast, spike‐reactive T cells were induced in both groups with similar CD4 and higher CD8 T‐cell levels in patients. Functional characterization of spike‐reactive T cells revealed equally high CTLA‐4 expression in both groups, but higher proportions of polyfunctional, triple‐cytokine expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells in patients especially after the third immunization. Three patients experienced mild breakthrough infections after second vaccination. Conclusions Despite limited ability of B‐cell depleted patients to mount a humoral immune response after multiple doses of SARS‐CoV‐2 mRNA vaccination, the vaccine‐induced T‐cell response is robust, which may have implications for protection against severe disease.">

        <tr id="Ending of COVID-19 pandemic does not exclude subsequent breakthrough infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutations increased with emerging omicron strain and exceeds those of the influenza virus. It remains unclear what IgG antibody levels are able to protect against new mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains, and how long the immune protection will last. The objective of this study was to monitor the maintenance of humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens over 4 years after the infection. Thirty-two adult reconvalescents after COVID-19 were annually examined for humoral and cellular immunity markers to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Humoral immunity was assessed by ELISA; cellular immunity was evaluated by expression of CD107a on CD8hi lymphocytes after recognition of S protein antigens. A four-year observation of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 (SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan strain) and were in contact with a novel, freely circulating mutant VoCs showed that, 1 year later, all subjects retained the IgG antibodies to S protein, mainly the IgG1 subclass, but the antibody avidity index barely exceeded 50%. After a breakthrough infection caused by the omicron strain, the level of IgG antibodies to S protein increased significantly, along with sufficient increase of antibody avidity. The IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 antibodies to S protein occured in the spectrum of subclasses. The level of specific IgA decreased 1 year after the disease against their level after the primary disease. However, it was significantly increased to 4-5 PR after breakthrough infections. Cellular immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was detected in all subjects at 1 year after the primary disease. After repeated infection with the omicron strain, it increased significantly and remained at this level for the next year. By 4 years, it decreased to the level that was a year after the disease. Hence, humoral and cellular immunity to S protein does not fade away, but continues to persist, maturate, being maintained at a sufficient level. Upon exposure to a new VoC, it allows to endure such a meeting either asymptomatically, or as a mild clinical infection. In view of frequent mutations in the S protein, the role of T-cell responses in anti-infectious protection seems to increase significantly. When developing new vaccines, one should rely on development of cellular immunity.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2029 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which enters the human body via the respiratory route and can infect nasal and bronchial epithelial cells, goblet cells, hair cells, pneumocytes, etc. COVID-19 caused the worst pandemic in centuries. SARS-CoV-2, once in the airway tree, penetrates the host cells and causes a strong inflammatory reaction by a rapid response of the innate immune system, in particular by activation of macrophages and dendritic cells that recognize the virus component proteins as non-self. Cells of the immune system secrete type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines, initiating an antiviral state in neighboring cells and in the intercellular connective matrix, recruiting new immune mediators and new cells to the site of infection. This rapid response is crucial for limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we aimed at highlighting some microscopic aspects of the acute inflammatory reaction in the lung for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis of the histological pieces suggested that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction begins with the accumulation of immune cells in the interalveolar septa in response to viral insult, congestion of pulmonary vessels with increased blood volume in pulmonary vessels, followed by the presence of alveolar exudate, which reduces the area of hematosis and triggers respiratory symptoms. The inflammatory reaction was totally inhomogeneous, varying widely from patient to patient and even within the same patient, probably depending on the immune status, age or comorbidities. It presented two phases, a predominantly exudative phase (EP) and a predominantly proliferative phase (PP), intricately intertwined; sometimes, on the same histopathological piece, we identified both areas of incipient inflammatory reaction (EP) and a very intense reaction in the PP, suggesting that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction developed rapidly. The inflammatory infiltrate had a complex composition: neutrophilic leukocytes, macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The most abundant inflammatory cells were macrophages, both in the EP and PP. The use of anti-interleukin (IL) antibodies showed that ILs are mainly produced by cells of the monocyte–macrophage system, but also by conjunctival cells (fibroblasts).">

We recently showed that HIV-1 promotes the ubiquitination of the amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), termed C99, to counteract its inhibitory effects on infection, but how and why C99 suppresses HIV-1 replication remains unclear. Here, we show that APP and Gag processing intersect and compete for two key components of the cellular sorting machinery, TSG101 and VPS4A. This in turn underlies the negative interplay between HIV-1 Gag and APP processing, whereby the need to replicate in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) increases amyloidogenic processing of APP and C99 in infected microglia.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review examines the role of heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) in COVID-19, highlighting its impact on immune modulation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Hsp60, a chaperone protein essential for protein folding and protection against cell stress, has been linked to COVID-19 pathogenesis through its interactions with the immune system and potential involvement in post-infectious autoimmune processes. One of the key aspects discussed is the phenomenon of molecular mimicry, wherein Hsp60 exhibits epitope similarity with a number of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, a circumstance that may potentially culminate in the induction of autoimmune responses. This mimicry has the potential to contribute to the development of autoimmune conditions, including Guillain–Barré syndrome and autoimmune thyroiditis, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The document discusses Hsp60’s role in endothelial damage and thromboembolic complications, suggesting it could serve as a biomarker for disease severity and a therapeutic target. It raises concerns about vaccine safety due to Hsp60’s structural similarity to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which may trigger autoimmune responses. The potential for Hsp60 to generate anti-tumor immunity is explored, indicating that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 might also target tumor cells with similar epitopes. Further research is necessary to understand Hsp60’s role in disease fully and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with immune dysfunction, but how disease-intrinsic mechanisms in treatment-naive patients influence the coordination of adaptive responses to novel antigens remains unclear. Here, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell immunity in 38 treatment-naive CLL patients and 13 healthy controls (HCs) following vaccination. Despite significantly reduced total immunoglobulin levels compared to HCs, 94.7% of CLL patients developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, and 89.5% mounted IgA responses, with serum titers comparable to those of HCs. Virus-specific T cell responses, measured by IFN-γ release following antigen stimulation, were detected in 78.9% of patients. CLL patients had significantly more circulating CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells than HCs. These expansions correlated with B cell abundance, which, in untreated CLL, predominantly reflects malignant B cells. Notably, Tfh cell frequencies and absolute counts were highest in patients lacking a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, indicating a decoupling between Tfh expansion and functional antiviral immunity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that while SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses are largely preserved in treatment-naive CLL patients, disease-driven alterations in T cell composition may compromise the coordination and quality of antigen-specific T cell-mediated immunity.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a prominent pathogen that impacts swine and presents a zoonotic threat to humans; it is a cause of bacterial meningitis, a severe condition linked to neurological impairment and elevated mortality rates. For SS2 to access the central nervous system, it must traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this process remain incompletely elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that the RTX family exoprotein A (RfeA), which is secreted by SS2, can be internalized by human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) via a caveolae/lipid raft-dependent pathway. RfeA subsequently induces pyroptosis through the NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway, a process attributed to the increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). The interaction between the N-terminus of RfeA and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) leads to mtROS production, which can be suppressed by a VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitor. RfeA-induced pyroptosis results in disruption of the BBB in both the hBMEC monolayer model and the mouse infection model, thereby promoting bacterial infection of the brain. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which SS2 induces pyroptosis to breach the BBB, suggesting a potential target for the prevention and treatment of SS2 infection.

We report five patients diagnosed with breakthrough MIS-C despite COVID-19 immunisation, all within a limited time period at the beginning of the Omicron wave, to assess whether breakthrough MIS-C cases share the same TCR Vβ21.3 skewing seen in non-vaccinated MIS-C cases. We retrospectively reviewed five MIS-C patients hospitalised between December 2021 and April 2022 despite previous immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2, an mRNA vaccine against S-protein). Immunophenotyping, including TCR Vβ subset distribution, was performed in four patients.Patients (100% male, 12.2–17.2 years) had a natural breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection following prior immunisation (between August 2021 and February 2022). Recent infection was proven by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and/or IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein. Blood samples of four patients were available. All presented with Vβ21.3+ T cell expansion, similar to MIS-C patients and in contrast to vaccinated historical KD patients (n=10). The two patients with the earliest sampling post-illness displayed frequencies of Vβ21.3+ T cells exceeding the reference mean value+10×SD. These Vβ21.3+ T cells showed increased surface expression of activation (HLA-DR, CD38) and exhaustion (PD-1, TIM-3) markers.In conclusion, breakthrough MIS-C patients presented with features consistent with unvaccinated MIS-C patients, including the hallmark Vβ21.3+ T cell expansion, indicating that prior immunisation with an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan strain did not fully protect against MIS-C at the wave of a novel emerging variant early 2022.

        <tr id="Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and limited therapeutic options. Conventional preclinical models, such as the bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis (BILF) model in immunocompetent mice, fail to replicate the complexity of the human immune environment and are thus unsuitable for evaluating human-specific antibody and cell therapies. To overcome this limitation, we developed two humanized mouse models with functional human immune components: one engrafted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the other with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Pulmonary fibrosis was induced using BLM in both humanized models. In the PBMC-humanized model, human T cells accounted for 79.9% ± 9.7% of CD45+ cells; however, this model was limited by high incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In contrast, the HSC-humanized model demonstrated stable multilineage engraftment (T cells: 20.1% ± 28.3%; B cells: 56.8% ± 25.4%), absence of GvHD, and consistent fibrotic pathology. Both models exhibited increased inflammatory infiltration, fibroblast activation, and collagen deposition following BLM induction. Nintedanib treatment significantly ameliorated fibrotic changes in both models. These findings establish the HSC-humanized BILF model as a clinically relevant platform for investigating human immune responses in IPF and for preclinical evaluation of human-targeted therapies.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which play a vital role in triggering innate immune responses such as the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs). While modest PRR activation helps to defend against SARS-CoV-2, excessive or sustained activation can cause harmful inflammation and contribute to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Altered expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are among the most important members of the PRR family members, particularly TLRs 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9, has been strongly linked to COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), collectively known as RLRs (RIG-I-like receptors), act as sensors that detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The expression of these receptors, as well as that of different DNA sensors, varies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Changes in PRR expression, particularly that of TLRs, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), and the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), have also been shown to play a role in the development and persistence of long COVID (LC). However, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved strategies to evade PRR recognition and subsequent signaling pathway activation, contributing to the IFN response dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Nevertheless, PRR agonists and antagonists remain promising therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review aims to describe the PRRs involved in recognizing SARS-CoV-2, explore their expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and examine their role in determining the severity of both COVID-19 and long-term manifestations of the disease. It also describes the strategies developed by SARS-CoV-2 to evade PRR recognition and activation. Moreover, given the considerable interest in modulating PRR activity as a novel immunotherapy approach, this review will provide a description of PRR agonists and antagonists that have been investigated as antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to explore the complex interplay between PRRs and SARS-CoV-2 in depth, considering its implications for prognostic biomarkers, targeted therapeutic strategies and the mechanistic understanding of long LC. Additionally, it outlines future perspectives that could help to address knowledge gaps in PRR-mediated responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

It is known that the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is expressed also in the gut, where SARS-CoV-2 could induce vascular damage and immune system dysregulation, similarly to what has been widely described in the lung1. This case report concerns a middle-aged man admitted to the Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy) and tested negative to the nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks after recovering from the infection. Due to thrombotic and hemorragic gut conditions, accompanied by severe ulceration, the patient underwent resection of a segment of ileum. Immunohistochemical analyses showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared to the non-ulcerated one2. Moreover, expression and co-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibronectin (FN) were analyzed. VEGF expression was increased in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared with control and non-ulcerated ileum. FN staining was progressively increasing in non-ulcerated and ulcerated ileum. By electron microscopy the microvilli alteration of brush border and of intercellular junctions were detected in the ulcerated area but not in other areas of patient’s ileum or in the control sample. The salient aspect of this study is that although the patient was declared negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the respiratory level, SPIKE and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins were still present in the ileum, concentrated in the ulcerated area and parallelled by an increased expression of vascular markers. The ultrastructural analysis gave insights on the morpho-functional effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection on the gut epithelium, indicating that the damage is not limited to vascular structures.">

        <tr id="Background Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a cellular mechanism that degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs), preventing the production of truncated, potentially harmful proteins. While its role in viral infections is increasingly recognized, the relationship between NMD-linked mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity remains poorly understood. Objective To investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nonsense mutations predicted to trigger NMD and assess their association with clinical disease severity and viral genomic. Methods We conducted whole-genome sequencing on samples from 129 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A panel of 21 nonsense mutations predicted to activate the NMD pathway was identified and analyzed. Statistical correlations with clinical severity were assessed, including multivariate analysis. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and interdependency analysis of mutation combinations were also performed. Results Five NMD-associated mutations (Variants 5, 6, 7, 9, and 15) showed significant associations with mild disease. These mutations, located in key SARS-CoV-2 genes, include Variant 5 (g.C5575G, T, synonymous substitution in ORF1ab), Variant 6 (g.T5653G, substitution in ORF1ab), Variant 7 (g.G6094GGACAGACTTT/GCCTACACGACGCTAATC, insertion in spike protein), Variant 9 (g.G6446GAATGA, insertion in spike protein), and Variant 15 (g.T10968TATATTGA, insertion in N protein). In the host-adjusted multivariable model, the presence of at least one NMD-inducing mutation was an independent protective factor (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.16–0.72, p = 0.005). However, after adjusting for SARS-CoV-2 lineage, this association was attenuated (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.03–13.84, p = 0.793). In the lineage-only model, Omicron infection showed higher odds of severe disease compared to Delta (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 0.77–4.77, p = 0.164). ROC analysis indicated limited predictive value for individual variants (AUC = 0.37–0.48), but specific combinations, such as Variants 5 and 7, markedly reduced severe case incidence (92.9–4.8%, p = 0.0001). Conclusion NMD-inducing nonsense mutations were associated with reduced COVID-19 severity in host-adjusted analyses, but this effect diminished after accounting for viral lineage, suggesting that variant distribution, particularly Omicron may influence these associations. Integrating viral genomic background with host and clinical data may enhance risk prediction and inform antiviral strategies.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Cytokine storm can result from uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokines released in SARS-CoV-2 infection that cause damage to several organs. Il-6 is one of the major mediators of cytokine storm. IFN-α2 has been reported to have anti-viral potential and the pre-infection levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been suggested to drive the fate of the disease. There is a paucity of information on how anti-viral cytokines at the onset of infection affect the disease progression. This study aims to profile IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-α2 expression levels for 44 days post-diagnosis and their effects on recovery.


METHODS
Peripheral venous blood was collected from 38 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants who came for diagnosis at the Center for Research on Emerging and Reemerging Diseases. IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-α2 levels were measured using a Luminex panel.


RESULTS
Males had higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load than females, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). Age-related variation was also observed, with individuals aged 40-60 showing significantly higher viral load than those over 60 (p=0.045). Cytokines analysis revealed that males had significantly higher levels of IFNα-2, IL-2, and IL-6 (p=0.0031, p=0.009, and p=0.022 respectively) than females upon diagnosis, with cytokines levels decreasing over time in males but increasing in females. Cytokine levels trended higher in symptomatic individuals, although differences were not significant.


CONCLUSION
These findings highlight the influence of sex, clinical status, and viral load on cytokine dynamics in COVID-19, with potential implications for understanding disease severity and immune response.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 variants have demonstrated distinct epidemiological patterns and clinical presentations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding variant-specific differences at the respiratory epithelium is crucial for understanding their pathogenesis. Here, we utilized human nasal organoid air–liquid interface (HNO-ALI) cell cultures to compare the viral replication kinetics, innate immune response, and epithelial damage of six different strains of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.2, WA, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron). All variants replicated efficiently in HNO-ALIs, but with distinct replication kinetic patterns. The Delta variant exhibited delayed replication kinetics, achieving a steady state at 6 days post-infection compared to 3 days for other variants. Cytokine analysis revealed robust pro-inflammatory and chemoattractant responses (IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, CXCL9, and CXCL11) in WA1, Alpha, Beta, and Omicron infections, while Delta significantly dampened the innate immune response, with no significant induction of IL-6, IP-10, CXCL9, or CXCL11. Immunofluorescence and H&E analysis showed that all variants caused significant ciliary damage, though WA1 and Delta demonstrated less destruction at early time points (3 days post-infection). Together, these data show that, in our HNO-ALI model, the Delta variant employs a distinct “stealth” strategy characterized by delayed replication kinetics and epithelial cell innate immune evasion when compared to other variants of SARS-CoV-2, potentially explaining a mechanism that the Delta variant can use for its enhanced transmissibility and virulence observed clinically. Our findings demonstrate that variant-specific differences at the respiratory epithelium could explain some of the distinct clinical presentations and highlight the utility of the HNO-ALI system for the rapid assessment of emerging variants.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer death, and better biomarkers and therapeutic targets are needed. We investigated the characteristics of fibrinolysis—an essential process that balances blood clot breakdown—and found that they divide HCC into biological subtypes with different tumor microenvironments and outcomes. Among these genes, hemopexin (HPX), a secreted protein that scavenges free heme, consistently showed a tumor-suppressive pattern in HCC. We built and externally validated a six-gene prognostic signature including HPX that stratifies patients by risk. Functional assays in multiple HCC cell lines and mouse models showed that increasing HPX levels reduced tumor growth and promoted programmed cell death through mitochondrial pathways linked to tumor necrosis factor-α. These results suggest that HPX may have value for risk assessment and could inform future strategies to modulate the tumor microenvironment in HCC.">

        <tr id="Fever, a universal host defense in infection and inflammation, paradoxically contributes to neurological complications in malaria. While febrile temperatures enhance the expression of parasite virulence proteins that mediate vascular adhesion and disease severity, its effects in the endothelium remain elusive. Here we present a 3D fever-on-a-chip model that recapitulates human brain and lung microvessels under febrile conditions. Short febrile episodes at 40 °C, common in treated cerebral malaria patients, rapidly enhanced iRBC and immune cell binding under flow. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that this phenotype was driven by endothelial glycocalyx shedding, which exposed endothelial receptors EPCR and ICAM-1. Preserving glycocalyx integrity with a broad MMP inhibitor prevented the temperature-induced rise in cytoadhesion. These findings identify fever as a host-specific amplifier of vascular pathology in malaria and highlight endothelial-protective or antipyretic interventions as important strategies to mitigate febrile microvascular pathology.">

During various infections, systemic inflammation significantly impairs host health. However, the regulation of inflammatory responses in birds, particularly in cognitively advanced parrots, remains poorly understood. Here, we examine parrot systemic inflammation in response to virus-mimicking stimulation. In budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a novel model for neuroinflammation research, we induced sterile inflammation with synthetic poly(I:C) RNA and analysed dose-, time- and tissue-dependent gene expression patterns of key markers, including TLR3, NLRP3, CASP1, IL1B and IL6, during acute immune response. We report a significant relationship between cytokine expression (IL1B, IL6) in the intestine (local response) and brain (systemic response) that has not yet been described after viral stimulation in parrots. Peripheral IL6 expression was upregulated at 3–6 h after stimulation with poly(I:C). In the brain, multiple genes (TLR3, IL1B and IL6) showed activation early during the immune response. These findings highlight the susceptibility of parrots to neuroinflammation following viral infections, having specific relevance for basic research in neurobiology, immunology and behavioural science, and also veterinary research in psittacine birds. Our study provides a foundation for future comparative research on avian neuro-immune crosstalk and neuroinflammation-related behavioural disorders.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity is the first line of defense against infections, including the detection and response to SARS-CoV-2. Cells of the innate system are usually activated within hours after pathogen exposure and do not generate conventional immunological memory. In this review, the current knowledge of the innate immune cells and of pattern-recognition receptors in sensing and responding to SARS-CoV-2 to mount a protective response has been shortly reviewed. Subsequently, the evasion strategies of the virus, as the inhibition of IFN-I/III production and autophagic response, counteracting the innate cell activity (including NK cells), have been briefly outlined. In the course of the infection, these strategies are also capable of rendering dysfunctional most innate cells, thus deeply interfering with the onset and maintenance of adaptive immunity. Possible mechanism(s) for the maintenance of dysfunctional innate immune response are also discussed. In this context, the importance of a rapid and robust activation of innate immunity through toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 as a key paradigm central to host defense against COVID-19 pathogenesis is also illustrated. We also discuss how the viral excess plus inflammatory signals upregulating TLR4 on innate cells may initiate a vicious loop which maintains and improves hyperinflammation, leading to the most critical outcomes. Targeting the TLR4 or its signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy, offering the dual benefits of viral suppression and decreasing inflammation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Sepsis, caused by an unbalanced host response to infection, remains a global health burden. The dysregulation between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is a primary driver of immune imbalance. As a central player in adaptive immunity, CD4+ T cells are crucial for maintaining this balance during sepsis by differentiating into various effector T cell subsets. Thus, elucidating the underlying mechanisms within the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance in CD4+ T cell subsets during sepsis is of great value. We first identified the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) as a significantly upregulated gene in CD4+ T cells from sepsis patients by conducting a comprehensive transcriptome meta-analysis. The expression of PIM1 was significantly elevated on CD4+ T cells from sepsis patients and was correlated with both SOFA and APACHE II scores. Moreover, we found that PIM1 promoted the differentiation of CD4+IFN-γ+ Th1 and CD4+IL-17A+ Th17 subsets while inhibiting the differentiation of CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs. Additionally, upon inhibiting PIM1 kinase activity in CD4+ T cells, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the cholesterol metabolism gene, ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), exhibited significant upregulation. More importantly, we found that the intracellular cholesterol content was decreased in CD4+ T cells after inhibiting the PIM1 kinase activity or knocking down PIM1. The portion of CD4+IFN-γ+ Th1 and CD4+IL-17A+ Th17 cells was recovered, and the CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs decreased after cholesterol supplementation to CD4+ T cells. These findings indicated that PIM1 may regulate the balance of Th1, Th17, and Treg subsets in a cholesterol-dependent manner in sepsis. IMPORTANCE This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance of CD4+ T cell subsets during sepsis. Our study provides evidence that PIM1 serves as a crucial regulator of sepsis-induced inflammation and elucidates that PIM1 participates in regulating the imbalance of Th1, Th17, and Treg subsets, further promoting inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance in sepsis. Additionally, the cholesterol metabolism, potentially mediated by ABCG1, is implicated in PIM1’s regulatory effect on the Th1, Th17, and Treg imbalance. Our study provides novel insights into the inflammatory imbalance during sepsis, which could facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the immune-inflammatory cascade in this condition.">

        <tr id="Pneumococcal infection of the leptomeninges triggers a strong inflammatory response, contributing to tissue damage and adverse outcome in meningitis. While border-associated macrophages (BAM) are thought to initiate immune responses against pathogens, their exact role in pneumococcal meningitis (PM) - especially at later stages - remains unclear. This study examined the impact of BAM depletion on disease progression. Mice received intracisternal injections of clodronate liposomes (CL) to deplete BAM, followed three days later by intracisternal infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. At 18 h post-infection, CL-treated mice exhibited clinical signs similar to controls treated with phosphate-buffered saline liposomes (PBSL). However, CL-treated mice had lower cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte counts, increased expression of brain immune mediators, and elevated plasma levels of neuronal damage (NEFL) and astrocyte activation (S100B) markers. Over a 42-h observation period - during which ceftriaxone therapy was started 18 h post-infection - CL-treated mice showed significantly worse outcomes: 9 of 12 reached termination criteria versus 1 of 9 PBSL-treated mice. This correlated with more severe neuropathology, higher bacterial loads, and persistent inflammation. Notably, infection with a pneumolysin-deficient mutant conferred strong protection against disease aggravation caused by macrophage depletion, whereas caspase-1 inhibition - despite its known immunosuppressive effects in experimental PM - did not. These findings underscore a critical immunoregulatory role for BAM in PM, particularly in resolving rather than initiating inflammation. Their absence exacerbates disease severity, mainly due to increased bacterial proliferation and elevated levels of bacterial toxins.

The authors used an autopsy platform allowing morphological and biochemical/molecular biological investigations in postmortem mirror blocks prepared from the brain and peripheral organs of 13 COVID and 23 non- COVID-infected patients. Microglia are resident macrophages of the brain, representing a ﬁ rst defense wall in the case of any type of bacterial or viral infection. 2 They possess G protein-coupled purinergic P2Y12 receptors (Rs) that sense ADP, arising from the enzymatic degradation of ATP that ﬂ ows out from glial/ neuronal cells after damage, caused by infections or metabolic disturbances. P2Y12Rs are localized at the membrane of the cytoplasmic processes of microglia; increased levels of locally generated ADP attract the active elongation of these processes to approach the sites of injury and later the migration of ameboid microglia to these sites. 3 Immuno ﬂ uorescence was used for quanti ﬁ cation of the levels of P2Y12Rs in the gyrus rectus of the frontal cortex and the medulla oblongata; a lower expression of this receptor was reported in COVID-af ﬂ icted microglia.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) undergoes primary acute lytic replication in mucosal epithelial cells and then spreads to establish latent infection in peripheral neurons including sensory and autonomic neurons. Latent HSV-1 reactivates to cause recurrent cold sores but can also cause more severe disease including keratitis and encephalitis. Animal models have been used extensively to study HSV-1 latent infection, while human sensory neuronal systems have been difficult to establish or make scalable. To address neuron-intrinsic mechanisms of HSV-1 latent infection, we developed a protocol to rapidly differentiate human-inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into sensory neurons. The differentiated neurons are excitable and express functional ion channels. We established conditions for latent infection with HSV-1 in these cells that show i) no infectious virus, ii) reduced lytic gene expression, iii) efficient latency-associated transcript expression, and iv) viral heterochromatin. Latent HSV-1 can be reactivated by previously known stimuli including forskolin and PI3Ki. Therefore, this scalable human iPSC-derived sensory neuron system is a promising model to explore mechanisms of HSV-1 latent infection in human neurons. IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex viruses are prevalent human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality in neonates and adults. They undergo acute infection in the mucosae and spread to peripheral neurons including sensory and autonomic neurons, where they establish lifelong latent infection. Reactivation from latency leads to recurrent infection and disease, including central nervous system infection that can be life-threatening. Experimental studies of HSV latency have mostly been conducted in animals, which may differ from the human situation. In this study, we establish a system for differentiation of human-inducible pluripotent stem cells into sensory neurons and for latent infection and reactivation by herpes simplex virus 1. This system will enable studies of the mechanism of HSV latent infection in human sensory neurons and therapeutic approaches to curtail it.">

        <tr id="With the unprecedented surge of severe COVID-19 cases in early 2020, researchers and medical professionals worked actively to identify effective viral infection treatments based on a scientific understanding of viruses. Over the past few years, an enormous amount of research has investigated the viral infection and replication processes following the first SARS-CoV-2 case. With this knowledge, many drugs have been explicitly created to inhibit viral replication or decrease the severity of the immune response. Additionally, scientists have utilized decades of research and techniques to expedite SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. SARS-CoV-2, a positive-strand RNA virus, belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgroup of Betacoronaviruses. Its emergence is not unique; previous outbreaks like SARS and MERS have shaped our understanding of coronavirus-related diseases. Molecular clock analysis suggests that the ancestor of all current coronaviruses existed over 10,000 years ago, with subsequent evolution occurring around 3300–2400 BC. Researchers have explored synthetic and natural treatments alongside other antiviral therapies, corticosteroids, and immunotherapies. Additionally, using artificial intelligence and nano-based technologies enriched SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and management.

        <tr id="Acute lower respiratory infections are the primary cause of global mortality in post-neonatal children. Most respiratory viruses primarily involve upper airway infection and inflammation, yet nasal responses are poorly characterized. Using a mouse model of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), we found viral burden was higher in nasal airways and exhibited delayed clearance. Despite high burden, there was low nasal expression of type I and III interferon (IFN). Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) from HMPV-infected mice showed lower nasal interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and nasal enrichment of genes negatively regulating IFN. scRNA-seq of COVID-19 patients confirmed lower ISG expression in upper airways. HMPV infection downregulated nasal expression of interferon regulatory factor-3, suggesting a mechanism for limited response. To rescue the quiescent environment, we administered type I or III IFN to upper airways early post-infection, leading to lower nasal HMPV titer and virus-specific CD8+ T-cell upregulation. Intranasal immunization adjuvanted with type I or III IFN improved immune response, reduced clinical disease, and enhanced viral clearance in HMPV and influenza infection. IFN adjuvant increased recruitment of dendritic cells, resident-memory T-cells, and neutralizing antibodies. These findings reveal locally suppressed IFN production contributes to a quiescent nasal immune landscape that delays viral clearance and impairs mucosal vaccine responses.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Immunoinhibitory molecules, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), contribute to T-cell exhaustion in chronic infections. In a sheep model of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, PD-L1 expression was correlated with BLV proviral load, and TIM-3 expression was upregulated in multiple T-cell subsets. Moreover, TIM-3 blockade, alone or combined with PD-L1 inhibition, enhanced T-cell activation and cytokine production, while PD-L1 blockade alone had limited effects. These findings demonstrate that TIM-3 plays a role in T-cell dysfunction in sheep and support the use of sheep as a model for evaluating immunotherapies targeting immunoinhibitory molecules in BLV infection and other chronic infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Tens of thousands of severe COVID-19 cases are hospitalized weekly in the U.S., often driven by an imbalance between antiviral responses and inflammatory signaling, leading to uncontrolled cytokine secretion. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is a known immune antagonist, but its role in macrophage-driven cytokine storms is unclear. We demonstrate that N functions in a pathway-specific manner, specifically amplifying nuclear factor κB-related transcripts upon Toll-like receptor 7/8 stimulation. Moreover, we show that this is a conserved feature of pathogenic coronaviruses, with the delta variant N being the most pro-inflammatory. Our interaction networks suggest the delta variant N drives inflammation through interactions with several stress granule-related proteins. Profiling of secreted cytokines revealed that supernatants from the delta variant N-expressing macrophages disrupt brain and heart endothelial barriers, implicating N in COVID-19-associated cognitive and cardiac complications. Our findings highlight N-mediated immune imbalance as a driver of severe COVID-19 and identify N as a promising therapeutic target to mitigate hyperinflammation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Survivors of COVID-19 frequently report psychiatric and cognitive sequelae. The origin of such sequelae has not been determined, as it has been a challenge to resolve whether these symptoms have a viral origin or are related to the contextual stressors associated with the pandemic. In the current study, we used a mouse model of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) to evaluate the neurobiological nature of the sequelae without the interference of the contextual effects on behavior following SARS-CoV-2 infection.


RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in behavioral deficits related to cognition but not anxiety- or depression-like behavior. The cognitive deficits were affected by the severity of the acute disease. Cytokine and chemokine levels as well as kynurenine pathway metabolites were significantly altered in the brains of infected mice. Both cytokine/chemokine levels and kynurenine pathway metabolites correlated with the severity of the acute disease. Microbiome taxonomic profiling revealed significant differences between groups, suggesting that specific bacterial species may be associated with the development of PASC.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to cognitive deficits in PASC, influenced by the severity of the acute disease. In contrast, PASC anxiety- and depression-like behavior was not related to the viral infection itself. This could indicate that PASC anxiety and depression is more linked to contextual stressors related to the pandemic, rather than the viral infection per se. Additionally, our results points to a role of cytokines and in particular metabolites of the kynurenine pathway in PASC, suggesting their potential as biomarkers and targets for pharmacological treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Persistent symptoms and complications reported by many patients for more than four weeks after contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome. These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability. Methods In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level of p < 0.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software. Results Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="In response to an infection, the host T cell compartment develops immunological memory to ensure rapid responses upon re-infection with the same pathogen. However, these memory responses can also modulate immune reactions to unrelated pathogens through bystander activation. Herein, T cells are activated in an antigen-independent manner, often triggered by innate cytokines or Toll-like receptor ligands. To uncover new strategies for modulating immune responses, it is essential to deepen our understanding of this alternative mechanism of T cell activation, particularly in humans. Therefore, we studied the response of human CD8+ T cells to innate bystander stimuli in vitro. Thereby, we measured the induction of activation markers and proliferation using flow cytometry, and depleted or blocked several potential modulatory components to identify mediators of bystander CD8+ T-cell responses. Our study demonstrates that CD8+ T cells can be activated as bystander cells in response to innate stimuli present during a viral infection, including IL-15, IFN-α, and TLR7/8 and 9 agonists (R848 and CpG). Depletion experiments demonstrated that these bystander responses are dependent on monocytes and CD4+ T cells. In addition, we revealed that the bystander responses to the innate stimuli are highly reliant on IL-2 signaling. Altogether, our study underscores the pivotal role of IL-2 in mediating bystander responses of CD8+ T cells to innate stimuli, revealing a novel mechanism of immune response modulation during viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background Pulmonary infections, ranging from mild respiratory issues to severe multiorgan failure, pose a major global health threat. The immune response in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and COVID-19 influences disease severity and outcomes, but molecular pathogenesis differs across pathogens. Comparisons of plasma cytokine profiles between CAP and COVID-19 are limited. Analyzing these profiles with machine learning and bioinformatics could reveal subtle patterns and improve our understanding of immune responses in both conditions. Methods We conducted a novel case–control study to profile cytokine levels in patients with CAP and COVID-19. Age- and sex-matched cohorts included 39 patients with CAP, 39 with COVID-19, and 20 healthy controls. We measured 384 plasma cytokine levels using proximity extension assays and analyzed differences between cohorts with conventional statistical methods, bioinformatics and machine learning. Results Median ages of the cohorts were comparable (P = 0.797). COVID-19 patients exhibited a higher prevalence of hematologic disease (P = 0.047), increased corticosteroid use (P = 0.040), and reduced antibiotic use (P = 0.012). Clinical outcomes, including mortality, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury, were similar between groups. Both cohorts showed comparable absolute circulating cytokine profiles but distinct profiles relative to healthy controls. Machine learning identified a model of twelve cytokines that distinguished CAP from COVID-19 with a classification accuracy of 0.71 (SD 0.20). Gene ontology and enrichment analysis revealed differences in cytosolic and nuclear functions, intracellular signaling, stress responses, and cell cycle processes between patient cohorts and healthy controls. Enriched GO pathways showed that CAP pathways were positively associated with leukocyte counts and ARDS development, while COVID-19 pathways were negatively associated with ARDS and positively with platelet counts. Conclusions This case–control study provides insights into cytokine profiles related to CAP and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Although absolute circulating cytokine levels showed no significant differences between the groups, machine learning identified a model of twelve proteins that effectively distinguished the cohorts. Gene ontology and enrichment analyses also revealed distinct dysregulated pathways with differing associations with clinical variables in each cohort. These findings underscore the complexity and variability of cytokine responses in pulmonary infections.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to far-reaching consequences. The changes caused in COVID-19 patients may persist for more than 6-12 months after acute phase of the disease promoting post-COVID disorders of immune system. Patients who have had acute COVID-19 in both mild and severe forms suffer from various manifestations of post-COVID syndrome. However, the severity of these manifestations is quite variable. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of lung damage extent in acute period of COVID-19 on the severity of clinical manifestations in post-COVID syndrome as exemplified by immune-mediated syndromes, i.e., autoimmune disorders, proliferative conditions, and allergopathology. 131 patients who had who had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were examined. Anamnestic data from outpatient cards of patients were used for the study. Using the ELISA diagnostics method, IgA, IgM, IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2, complement components C1q, C3a, C5a were determined. The studies revealed a connection between the severity of post-COVID syndrome and the severity of the acute COVID-19 course. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able of activating complement, and this activation persists for a long time (more than six months). This finding explains presence of clinical manifestations of post-COVID syndrome in individuals who have had a mild acute form of COVID-19 without CT-detected lung damage without phenotypes of immune system damage that we have previously identified (congenital – decreased expression of CD46 on T lymphocytes and decreased expression of CD46 on NK cells, and acquired – decreased level of T-cytotoxic lymphocytes and impaired level of B-cells CD45+CD3-CD19+CD5+CD27+). The data obtained indicate that the examination of post-COVID patients should be carried out not only by their clinical characteristics, but also by assessing markers of their immune system in order to make a correct diagnosis and prescribe etiological and pathogenetic therapy, including immune therapy. Conclusions: 1. Autoimmune, proliferative and allergic diseases are directly related to disorders of the immune system. The severity of autoimmune disorders in the post-COVID period is more associated with basic corticosteroid therapy (GCS) both for the treatment of autoimmune processes and for the treatment of COVID-19 (except of treating autoimmune thyroiditis). GCS treatment used in acute period of infection reduced the number of recurrenct disorders. The situation is the opposite in rheumatoid arthritis: the use of GCS in the acute period of infection in patients already on basic corticosteroid therapy subsequently leads to an increase in the number of relapses in post-COVID patients. 2. In post-COVID patients, we revealed a trend towards an increase in the most clinically severe allergopathology: firstly, in all groups (52%) in the post-COVID period, exacerbations of such pathologies as Quincke’s edema, urticaria, anaphylaxis, vasculitis, alveolitis, and bronchiolitis became more frequent. These findings suggest that the worse condition of these patients in the post-COVID period was influenced by the past SARS-CoV-2 infection Allergic skin lesions were in second place in terms of the frequency of exacerbations (about 28%). 3. There is a tendency towards an increased frequency of proliferative diseases exacerbations in patients with more severe forms of acute COVID-19 infection. It should also be noted that the percentage of such patients is quite high, from 31.6% to 48%. 4. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect the complement activation system, thus explaining clinical manifestations of post-COVID syndrome in the persons who had a mild form of COVID-19 without evidence of lung damage immune system affection. Our data indicate that the examination of post-COVID patients should be carried out not only by assessing their clinical characteristics, but also by examining the state of the immune system in such patients in order to make a correct diagnosis and administer etiological and pathogenetic therapy, including immune therapy.">

        <tr id="The complications and lingering effects of COVID-19 have caused a global health crisis, prompting intense investigations into the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease. The majority of symptoms associated with this infectious disease are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, and recent studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can impair host mitochondrial function. This study aims to investigate mutations in the MT-CYB and MT-ATP6 genes of mtDNA in COVID-19 patients and their association with disease outcomes. Out of 110 individuals enrolled, 30 were diagnosed with COVID-19, while the remaining 80 were healthy. Following DNA isolation from the blood samples, the MT-CYB and MT-ATP6 genes were amplified through PCR, purified, and sequenced using Sanger sequencing. In the MT-CYB gene, 9 distinct mutations were found. Among these, novel mutation m.14942A > C was more prevalent in COVID-19-positive individuals than COVID-19 negative controls (p = 0.012 < 0.05) and exhibited a significant correlation with the disease as OR (95% CI) = 19.75 (2.264–172.246). According to in-silico analyses, this mutation is deemed deleterious and decreases the stability of the CYB protein. In case of the MT-ATP6 gene, among the identified 8 mutations, the m.8744T > G mutation was higher in COVID-19-positive individuals than healthy controls (p = 0.009 < 0.05) and showed a significant correlation with the disease: OR (95% CI) = 24.04 (2.81–205.62). According to in-silico analyses, this mutation is found to be pathogenic and reduces the stability of the ATP6 protein. In conclusion, one novel mtDNA mutation was identified in this study, and some of the mutations identified in the MT-CYB as well as MT-ATP6 genes, including the novel mutation, are relatively common in the COVID-19 patient group. Moreover, the findings demonstrated that these mutations may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Pyroptosis is a mode of inflammatory cell death, characterized by cell membrane rupture and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Pyroptosis is a critical part of the innate immune response and acts as a defense mechanism against different types of pathogens, including viruses. Several respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, and SARS-CoV-2, have been shown to trigger pyroptosis through distinct mechanisms. While pyroptosis is beneficial to the host by controlling virus replication and eliminating infected cells, the exaggerated induction of pyroptosis can be harmful and cause significant tissue damage, such as that to the lung tissue during infection with respiratory viruses. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and the role pyroptosis plays during respiratory virus infections could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to reduce the morbidity caused by these infections.

        <tr id="Background Patients with hemato-oncological malignancies may respond insufficiently to vaccination, especially in terms of antibody titer. The antibody response depends on the type of malignancy as well as the type and timing of treatment. We intended to evaluate this using real-world data from patients of our regional hospital. This study also considers the role of immune status, including T-cell activation markers, in predicting vaccination success. Methods Seventeen patients of our hospital having a hematological malignancy were included in this study, including myeloma, lymphoma, as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL). All patients were vaccinated against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using Tozinameran following current recommendations. Circulating antibodies directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by a commercial immune assay. Immune status was determined from peripheral blood by flow cytometry. Both parameters were followed in fifteen patients who provided sufficient follow-up data for up to one year. Patients were categorized as responders or non-responders, and differences in diagnosis, treatment, and immune status were analyzed. Results Antibody response depended on both diagnosis and treatment. Active treatment directed against B-cells, such as anti-Cluster of Differentiation 20 (CD20) therapy, was associated with weak seroconversion. For CD38-as well as proteasome-directed therapies, the data suggest that responders as well as non-responders exist. Notably, low peripheral B-cell numbers and high CD3+HLADR+cell counts correlated with weak seroconversion upon vaccination. Conclusions We suggest that peripheral immune status can be applied as a predictive biomarker for seroconversion upon vaccinations.">

In this context, we aim to analyze the plasma proteomic and metabolomic profiles of unvaccinated nonagenarian patients who had severe manifestations of COVID-19 and either recovered or died and compare them with noninfected control subjects. Compared with healthy individuals, nonsurviving patients showed a reduced abundance of specific lipid-related proteins and metabolites, including APOH, APOC1, LCAT, 7-α-25-dihydroxycholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and phosphatidylethanolamine, which may serve as indicative markers of severity. Acute phase response, complement activation, and sphingolipids and phospholipids remain altered in recovered patients, indicating possible persistent effects of COVID-19.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT A fundamental property of viruses is their burst size—the amount of progeny produced during one round of infection. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread pathogen, causing significant morbidity in the human population worldwide. Despite decades of investigation into the biology of HSV-1, its burst size at the single-cell level has not been rigorously assessed. Here, we characterized HSV-1 progeny production by individual human keratinocytes, the physiological target of HSV-1 infection. Using a fluorescently-tagged virus, high-throughput single-cell sorting, and miniaturized plaque assay, we have quantified the progeny released from over a thousand individual cells throughout infection, at two multiplicities of infection. We found that individual keratinocytes harbor a very small number of infectious viruses inside them, which necessitated physical separation of cells to account for both secreted and cell-associated progeny. The total progeny produced by individual cells spans three orders of magnitude, and this variability is observed at both high and low multiplicities of infection, with a small sub-population of super-producer cells responsible for the majority of produced progeny by the entire population. We further found that super-production is not a genetic trait of the virus, as amplification of viruses produced by low and high producer cells results in similar burst sizes. Our findings both shed light on the fundamental process of progeny production during HSV-1 infection and provide a novel target for antiviral development, aimed at blocking super-producer cells. IMPORTANCE Viruses are defined by their ability to take over host cells and turn them into factories that produce new progeny. Recent advances in Biology allowed us to study viral infections at the single-cell level, illuminating the vast heterogeneity presented by genetically identical cells during viral infection. Despite these advances, for many viruses, we still lack even basic characterization of progeny production at the single-cell level, due to the highly demanding technical challenges associated with measuring it. Here, we present the first quantification of progeny production by individual human keratinocytes infected by herpes simplex virus 1, revealing most individual cells produce a low level of new progeny, while a few rare cells produce significantly more.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 has caused more than 7 million deaths worldwide, and according to the World Health Organization, it continues to result in more than 1000 reported deaths per month at the time of this writing. It is crucial to understand the immune response to COVID-19 since the virus continues to persist. Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in the immune defense against viral infections, including COVID-19. While it is well documented that infected patients have a reduction in lymphocytes and NK cells, gaps in knowledge exist regarding the function of NK cells. To study the function of NK cells in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, peripheral blood was obtained from patients admitted to the medical (non-ICU) wards at a large tertiary hospital. We demonstrated a decrease in the mature cytotoxic subset of NK cells within the peripheral blood of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We also observed a notable reduction in the cytotoxic function of NK cells against tumor targets. We examined the mechanisms leading to NK cell killing. We found reductions in the intracellular levels of effector molecules, the degranulation of cytotoxic granules, and the extracellular concentrations of released effector molecules. We identified dysfunctional intracellular granule trafficking required to position the granules for degranulation, which would be consistent with the reduced release of effector molecules. We found clusters of inhibitory receptors were upregulated in subsets of NK cells, in keeping with inhibition of cytotoxicity. Additionally, males with COVID-19 showed NK cell defects compared to healthy males, while no significant differences were observed in females. Our findings highlight defects in cytolytic effector molecules, granule trafficking and release, and increased expression of inhibitory receptors on NK cells in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, in addition to a sex difference in cytolytic function, which contributes to defective NK cell function in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Abstract The pathology of severe COVID-19 is due to a hyperinflammatory immune response persisting after viral clearance. To understand how the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is regulated to avoid severe COVID-19, we tested relevant immunoregulatory cytokines. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-4 were neutralized upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (CMA3p20), a model of mild disease; lung inflammation was quantified by histology and flow cytometry at early and late time points. Mild weight loss and lung inflammation including consolidation and alveolar thickening were evident 3 d postinfection (dpi), and inflammation persisted to 7 dpi. Coinciding with early monocytic infiltrates, CCL2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were transiently produced 3 dpi, while IL-12 and CCL5 persisted to 7 dpi, modeling viral and inflammatory phases of disease. Neutralization of TGF-β, but not IL-10 or IL-4, significantly increased lung inflammatory monocytes and elevated serum but not lung IL-6. Neutralization of IL-4 prolonged weight loss and increased early perivascular infiltration without changing viral titer. Anti-IL-4 reduced expression of Arg1, a gene associated with alternative activation of macrophages. Neutralizing TGF-β and IL-4 had differential effects on pathology after virus control. Lung perivascular infiltration was reduced 7 dpi by neutralization of IL-4 or TGF-β, and periairway inflammation was affected by anti-TGF-β, while alveolar infiltrates were not affected by either. Anti-IL-4 prolonged IL-12 to 7 dpi along with reduced IL-10 in lungs. Overall, the immunoregulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-4 dampen initial inflammation in this mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that promotion of immunoregulation could help patients in early stages of disease.">

        <tr id="The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an acute, highly contagious, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) gammacoronavirus mainly transmitted to chickens through the intranasal route. Positive-sense ssRNA viruses primarily act on mRNA and enhance the replication of viral copies. We identified the nasal entry site of the IBV-QX strain and provided insights into the minimal viral replication in systemic organs. Here is an overview of its entry mechanisms and tropism in systemic organ tissues. It enters the host cells via spike proteins, which bind to highly expressed receptors in respiratory, renal, and gastric epithelial cells. Viral RNA primarily replicates in the host cell environment, where it is directly translated into viral proteins. The precise replication of the IBV-QX strain in gastric epithelial cells was previously unknown. Different IBV strains have varying tropism. For the first time, we revealed the key players involved in the microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway by transfecting gastric cells with the IBV-QX strain. Our findings suggest that the QX strain may bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors by circulating throughout the lymphatic system at the very least and influence the translation of argonaute2 (AGO2), Dicer, exportin5 (XPO5), and Drosha proteins. Taken together, QX viral proteins disrupt host miRNA biogenesis, leading to dysregulated immune and cellular responses that enhance viral replication and systemic spread, thereby enabling cross-organ tropism and multi-system pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="As the pediatric COVID-19 landscape evolves, it is essential to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes children to allergic disorders. This narrative review synthesizes current epidemiological and immunological evidence linking pediatric COVID-19 with new-onset atopy. Epidemiological data remain heterogeneous: large Korean and multinational cohorts report increased risks of asthma and allergic rhinitis following COVID-19, whereas U.S. cohorts show neutral or protective associations, highlighting geographic and methodological variability. Mechanistic insights provide biological plausibility: epithelial injury and the release of alarmin cytokines (IL-33, IL-25, TSLP) promote Th2 polarization and ILC2 expansion, while epigenetic “scars” (e.g., LMAN2 methylation changes) and hematopoietic stem cell reprogramming may sustain long-term Th2 bias. Cytokine memory involving IL-7 and IL-15 contributes to altered T- and B-cell homeostasis, whereas disrupted regulatory T-cell function may reduce tolerance thresholds. Paradoxical trade-offs exist, such as ACE2 downregulation in allergic airways, which may lower viral entry but simultaneously amplify type-2 inflammation. Together, these processes suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection could foster a pro-allergic milieu in susceptible children. Although current evidence is inconclusive, integrating epidemiological surveillance with mechanistic studies is crucial for predicting and alleviating post-COVID allergic outcomes. Longitudinal pediatric cohorts and interventions targeting epithelial alarmins or microbiome restoration may hold promise for prevention.">

Identifying sensitive and specific biomarkers, along with elucidating immune-mediated mechanisms, is essential for improving the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. To predict key molecular markers of COVID-19 using an established multi-omics framework combined with machine learning models.We conducted an integrated analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA sequencing, and proteomics data to identify critical biomarkers associated with COVID-19. The multi-omics approach enabled the characterization of gene expression dynamics and alterations in immune cell subsets in COVID-19 patients. Machine learning techniques and molecular docking analyses were employed to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets within the disease’s pathophysiological network.Principal component analysis effectively grouped samples based on clinical characteristics. Using random forest and SVM-RFE models, we identified clinical indicators capable of accurately distinguishing COVID-19 patients. Transcriptomic analysis, including scRNA-seq, highlighted the pivotal role of CD8+ T cells, and WGCNA identified related module genes. Proteomic analysis, integrated with machine learning, revealed 36 DEPs. Further investigation identified several genes associated with monocyte proportions. Correlation analysis showed that BTD, CFL1, PIGR, and SERPINA3 were strongly linked to CD8+ T cell abundance in COVID-19 patients. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that these genes could effectively distinguish between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals. Concordant findings from both transcriptomic and proteomic levels support BTD, CFL1, PIGR, and SERPINA3 as potential auxiliary diagnostic markers. Finally, AlphaFold-based molecular docking analysis suggested these biomarkers may also serve as candidate therapeutic targets.Preliminary findings indicate that BTD, CFL1, PIGR, and SERPINA3 are vital molecular biomarkers related of CD8+ T cell, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms and long-term prevention of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Extensive research has demonstrated the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on maternal-fetal outcomes. However, few studies have examined the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during organogenesis on human embryo implantation and subsequent development. Additionally, the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on the endometrial microenvironment, which is critical for embryo implantation, remains poorly understood. This study seeks to address these gaps in knowledge. Methods and findings We prospectively enrolled 971 participants undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) during the final two months of 2022, coinciding with the nationwide COVID19 outbreak following the end of China’s Zero-Covid policy. Patients undergoing FET during this period were at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during organogenesis. Based on self-reported symptoms and nucleic acid testing, 520 individuals were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 451 were uninfected. Consistent with existing literature, our study reinforced that SARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacted pregnancy outcomes, as evidenced by reduced clinical pregnancy (52.69% vs. 76.50%, RR = 60.506, [95%CI, 0.259 ~ 0.452]) and live birth rates (46.54% vs. 60.09%, RR = 17.865, [95%CI, 0.448 ~ 0.746]), alongside an increase in obstetric complications (35.89% vs. 27.37%, RR = 4.380, [95%CI, 1.055 ~ 2.223]). Seven fetal congenital heart defects (CHDs) were observed in the infected group versus one in uninfected population. Bioinformatic analysis of endometrial mRNA profiles showed SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly downregulated key endometrial receptivity molecules, increased natural killer cell and mast cell infiltration, and disrupted the balance of cytokine and chemokine. Moreover, our findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulated the transcriptional activity of endometrial SLC6A, a serotonin transporter, and ErbB-2, a mediator of serotonin-regulated differentiation in cardiac development. This disruption in serotonin signaling may underlie the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during organogenesis negatively impacts embryo implantation and development, primarily through mechanisms involving compromised endometrial receptivity and disruption of the local immune microenvironment.">

Here, we recruited 40 healthy controls, 64 PICC patients, 65 PISC patients, and 20 recovered individuals with postinfectious subacute cough (R‐PISC). As cough and airway inflammation resolved in R‐PISC subjects, sputum lymphocytes dropped substantially. Both PICC and PISC patients had an increase in blood activated interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ)+ T‐lymphocytes, which were decreased in R‐PISC subjects. Elevated cough sensitivity, higher proportions of activated IFN‐γ+ T‐lymphocytes, and CD8+/CD4+ T‐lymphocyte ratios, as well as elevated concentrations of uric acid, IFN‐γ, tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), IFN‐α, IFN‐β, and interleukin‐10 in sputa, were observed in PICC and PISC patients but normalized in R‐PISC subjects. Correlation analyses and logistic regression models identified activated IFN‐γ+ T‐lymphocytes and these cytokines in sputa as biomarkers for predicting cough risk. PICC patients exhibited greater cough severity, elevated activated IFN‐γ+ T‐lymphocytes, and TNF‐α concentrations in sputa compared to PISC patients.

A sensory neuronal model, derived from human dental pulp stem cells and differentiated into peripheral neuronal equivalents (PNEs), was used to examine RV’s effects on airway sensory nerves.

Methods PNEs or primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) were infected with the RV-A16 strain. Viral replication was confirmed by viral titration assays, immunofluorescence (IF) for the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication intermediate and western blotting (WB). RNA sequencing was used to determine transcriptomic changes in PNEs, and inflammatory responses were assessed by inflammatory microarray. Calcium mobilisation assays were used to investigate the effect of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) on PNE transient receptor potential (TRP) A1 channel responses. Results Viral titrations, WB and IF confirm RV-A16 entry and replication in PNEs and PBECs. Gene signatures associated with antiviral immune responses, sensory neuropathies and N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor activity were upregulated in RV infected PNEs. Several cytokines were increased from PNEs and PBECs following RV infection, most notably IL-1β. Treatment of PNEs with IL-1β resulted in heightened TRPA1 channel sensitivity. Conclusion We report the suitability of an airway neuronal model for the study of the direct effects of RV infection on nerves. RV-induced release of IL-1β from airway epithelium heightens neuronal TRPA1 responses suggesting a mechanism for virus-induced cough hypersensitivity.

        <tr id="Background: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality during seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. Human infection with IAV can lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and numerous clinical and basic research studies have established an association between IAV and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). However, the treatment of IAV-induced PF fibrosis has not been studied and discussed. Methods: An IAV-induced PF mouse model was established. Herbacetin (HBT) was identified as the most effective compound in the in vitro study of seven components of Rhodiola rosea L. (R. rosea L.). The effect of HBT on IAV-induced lung injury and PF was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The binding between HBT and neuraminidase (NA) protein was investigated by biological layer interferometry (BLI) and cell thermal shift assay (CETSA). Results: Following IAV infection, the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway is activated, leading to the upregulation of fibrosis-related proteins that promote fibrosis. HBT exhibited a significant ability to reduce influenza virus-induced lung injury and fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HBT binds to the NA protein of the influenza virus, reducing viral infection and the activation of the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, thereby mitigating the formation of lung injury and PF. Conclusions: HBT represents a promising therapeutic agent for modulating influenza virus-induced lung injury and PF, marking a significant step toward the development of effective treatments for influenza-induced PF.">

In mice, T cells have been shown to be imperative in disease progression and lethality, whereas in humans, an early and robust T cell responses has been associated with survival. Here, we assessed the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells on disease progression and severity of Lassa virus infection in a non-human primate model. Using an antibody-mediated T cell depletion strategy prior to and post-inoculation, we were able to examine Lassa virus infection in the absence of specific T cell responses. In animals depleted for either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, Lassa virus infection remained uniformly lethal, with only a slight delay in disease progression observed in the CD4-depleted group when compared to non-depleted controls. Milder pulmonary pathology was noticed in the absence of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Overall, our findings suggest that T cells have a limited impact on the development of Lassa fever in non-human primates.">

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a life-threatening syndrome involving dysfunction of multiple immune cell types.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to comprehensively depict the dynamic trajectory of immune responses throughout the disease course of HBV-related ACLF (HBV-ACLF).


DESIGN
Single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell proteomics were performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 45 samples from 17 patients who were hospitalised (progressive/stable/recovering course of HBV-ACLF, 6/5/6) and 15 control subjects (liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and healthy controls, 5/5/5). Functional and mechanistic experiments were validated in vivo and in vitro.


RESULTS
Single-cell multiomics analysis revealed specific changes in the peripheral immune response in ACLF. VCAN+CD14+-monocytes with activated interferon-stimulated genes and enhanced inflammatory functions, stimulated by HBV relapse and expanded in ACLF-1, fuelling early inflammatory storm. The subsequent apoptotic hepatocytes predominantly induce hyperinflammatory C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2)+-neutrophils and CD163+-monocytes, enriching in patients with progressive ACLF and serving as significant markers of disease deterioration. Cytotoxic T-cells were functionally impaired and significantly decreased in progressive patients. CXCR2+-neutrophils exhibited immunosuppressive activity and induced the exhaustion of cytotoxic T-cells. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 significantly reduced neutrophils infiltration, restored cytotoxic T-cells and showed therapeutic effect in ACLF mice. Six immune cellular modules (CMs) were identified for patient stratification, with CM2 and CM6 showing strong predictive value for disease outcomes, and CM3 indicating a potential early therapeutic window.


CONCLUSION
Our longitudinal multiomics study revealed the dynamic evolution of the immune response in HBV-ACLF and characterised diverse immune patterns for the future precise management and therapeutic intervention.">

This condition involves complex interactions between the virus, resident cells of the central nervous system and leukocytes recruited to the brain. We reviewed the mechanisms underlying leukocyte recruitment during flavivirus-induced encephalitis with a focus on the role of various chemoattractants and adhesion molecules. We discuss how these molecules orchestrate the migration of peripheral leukocytes into the brain parenchyma and how neurotropic flaviviruses induce this process. Moreover, we discuss evidence of leukocytes both controlling viral propagation and contributing to neuropathology, which poses a challenge for therapy development.

        <tr id="Background Elite controllers can spontaneously control HIV-1 infection without antiretroviral treatment but remain at risk of developing non-AIDS-related conditions. The adaptive immune system is key in mediating spontaneous viral control; however, the innate immune response remains understudied. We assessed the quality of the innate immune responses by evaluating the phenotype and function of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in South African adults living with HIV (PWH). Methodology A total of 73 black South Africans were included in this study. Of these, 55 were living with HIV and included 16 individuals with spontaneous viral control (PWHEC), 20 HIV progressors (PWHPROG), and 19 individuals suppressed on ART (PWHART). Eighteen individuals without HIV infection (PWOHHIV-) served as the control group. Monocyte subsets, T cell and monocyte activation and the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) by monocytes, myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells were analyzed using multicolour flow cytometry following stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR)4 (LPS), TLR7/8 (CL097), and TLR9 (CpG-ODN2216) ligands. Plasma biomarkers, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and D-dimer were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Our findings show a reduced expression of CD86 on monocytes of PWHEC (p=0.04) compared to PWOHHIV-. A reduced frequency of the classical monocyte (CD14+CD16) subset in PWHEC (p=0.02) and PWHPROG (p=0.05) compared to PWOHHIV-. TNF-α and IL-1β production was lower in monocytes and mDCs of PWHEC compared to PWOHHIV- post-stimulation with TLR4, and TLR7/8 (all p<0.05). Increased sCD14 levels in PWHEC compared to PWOHHIV- (p=0.01) indicate persistent immune activation, whereas increased D-dimer levels in PWHPROG compared to PWHART (p=0.01) and PWHEC (p=0.04) suggest higher inflammation in PWHPROG. Conclusion PWHEC exhibits similar immune responses as other PWH including PWHPROG, their innate immune profiles are characterized by lower levels of monocyte activation, reduced levels of classical monocytes, reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and elevated biomarkers associated with unfavourable disease outcomes. These findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring and potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate chronic inflammation in PWHEC. Furthermore, it expands our understanding of complex innate immune cell responses in PWHEC.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in facilitating the sexual transmission of HIV, functioning as a delivery system responsible for trafficking the virus from exposed barrier sites to their key target cells, CD4 T cells. Although the role of DCs in HIV transmission is well established, the recent advent of high-parameter, single-cell detection technologies, coupled with improved cell isolation techniques, has led to the rapid reclassification of the DC landscape, particularly within human barrier tissues. The identification of new subsets introduces the challenge of incorporating previously understood transmission principles with new, cell-specific, functional nuances to identify the key DCs responsible for facilitating HIV infection. This review explores the history of research linking DCs with HIV transmission as well as our understanding of how HIV manipulates DC biology to achieve this purpose. Furthermore, it provides an up-to-date understanding of the antigen-presenting cell landscape within human anogenital tissues and how each subset contributes to sexual transmission. Uncovering the cells and biological processes responsible for the sexual transmission of HIV is a fundamental step in the pursuit of an HIV vaccine and better prophylaxis to block infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract BACKGROUND. Cerebrovascular and neurological diseases are frequent co-morbidities among people with HIV. Our laboratory has described that brain pericytes (BP) can harbor HIV infection and function as a reservoir of viral latent infection in the Central Nervous System. Given that the interaction between pericytes and endothelial cells in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are necessary for proper formation, development, stabilization, and maintenance of the BBB, we investigated whether active and/or latent HIV-1 infection can differently modulate inflammatory response in BPs, with a focus on RNA sensor and type I interferon (IFN) pathways. METHODS. Primary cultures of human brain vascular pericytes were infected with 60 ng/ml of p24 HIV (NL4-3 strain). Three and 7 days post-infection (dpi), which were previously shown to correspond to active and latent infection, respectively, protein and total RNA were extracted from infected and uninfected control cultures. Expression or protein content of RNA sensors and downstream activators and members of type I IFN response and IFN response genes were determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting, respectively. RESULTS. At 3 dpi, HIV gag transcripts were detected at high levels in infected cultures, which dropped significantly at 7 dpi. RIG-1 protein levels were significantly increased at 7 dpi (2.3-fold), whereas MDA5 was decreased by 0.5-fold. Similarly, STING (Stimulator of IFN genes) mRNA and protein levels were increased at 7 dpi, accompanied by increased expression of MAVS and of TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1, 1.7-fold), and phosphorylation of IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3). The IFN-α/β receptor type I (IFNAR1) and STAT1 transcripts were selectively increased at 7 dpi. Expression of interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats-1 (IFIT1) was transiently increased at 3 dpi and reduced at 7 dpi. No changes in the cGAS, TRAF3, IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and Interferon-induced GTP-binding protein Mx1 were observed at the mRNA levels in infected cultures, as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS. HIV-1 differentially modulates IFN responses in BPs, which can affect BBB integrity in chronic infections. Interestingly, latently infected BPs can contribute to long-term neuroinflammatory stimuli in the CNS.">

However, development of a live-attenuated vaccine using the TC-83 strain has been hampered by substantial reactogenicity and the potential for neuroinvasion. In this study, we demonstrate that V4020, a new TC-83-based investigational VEEV vaccine with redundant safety features preventing neuroinvasion and reversion, exhibited no neuroinvasion potential in a murine model. Following subcutaneous or intramuscular administration, a subset of mice that received the TC-83 vaccine succumbed to central nervous system infection, with replicating virus detected in the CNS, demonstrating a low, yet detectable neuroinvasion potential of the TC-83 vaccine in vivo. Sequencing analysis of the TC-83 virus recovered from the brains identified a pseudoreversion of E2 R120I, as E2 R120 is known to confer attenuation for TC-83. In contrast, V4020 showed no evidence of virus in the CNS, highlighting one of the V4020 features, a new synonymous codon to minimize reversion to the wild-type residue. Overall, our study establishes V4020 as a rationally designed, safe vaccine candidate for VEEV with significantly reduced neuroinvasion risk.">

These cells employ unique antigen recognition mechanisms to trigger rapid immune responses. γδ T cells facilitate early pathogen elimination and immune regulation, whereas MAIT cells detect microbial metabolites and modulate the systemic inflammation. NKT cells balance immune homeostasis through dual pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This review classifies these subsets and examines their sepsis-related functions alongside immunotherapies targeting them, such as cytokine manipulation, immunomodulators, and checkpoint inhibitors. Elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying sepsis could advance therapies that restore immune equilibrium and potentially improve clinical outcomes.

        <tr id="Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification and characterization of intracellular proteins with antiviral activity (known as restriction factors) is a key first step towards the future development of novel host-directed antiviral therapies. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity of 14 different interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) proteins against SARS-CoV-2. Overexpression of human guanylate binding protein (GBP) 1 resulted in potent inhibition of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, as well as against Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 variants of concern (VOCs). Moreover, knockdown or knockout of endogenous human GBP1 resulted in enhanced titers of SARS-CoV-2. While hGBP1 can restrict some viruses via actin remodeling, our data indicate that this is not the mechanism here. Moreover, we show that unlike GBP2 and GBP5, which impair spike protein processing, GBP1 did not reduce infectivity of spike-pseudotyped viruses following titration on Caco-2 cells. Multiple human GBPs have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro; however, we report no significant differences in virus titers recovered from the upper or lower airways of SARS-CoV-2-infected wild-type mice compared to from mice lacking the chromosome 3 cluster of mouse GBPs (GBP1/2/3/5/7). Together, our studies describe the ability of human GBP1 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, highlighting this host protein as a potential target for the development of host-directed antiviral therapies against this virus.IMPORTANCEViruses like SARS-CoV-2 can cause widespread illness and death. While currently licensed antiviral drugs are critical tools, drug resistance can develop. Our immune system produces intracellular proteins called "restriction factors" that can limit virus replication within cells. These proteins are promising targets for developing new antiviral therapies. In this study, we identified one such protein, human GBP1, which inhibited a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro, including Delta and Omicron. Interestingly, GBP1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 through a different mechanism to that of other human GBPs as it did not interfere with prosessing of the viral spike protein. Of interest, a cluster of mouse GBPs, including GBP1, did not demontrate significant antiviral activity in a mouse model of infection. Overall, our findings suggest that human GBP1 could be a valuable target for host-directed antiviral strategies and highlight the limitations of using mouse models to study certain aspects of human innate immunity.">

        <tr id="Persistent RNA virus infections (PI) are often characterized by extended viral shedding and maintained cycles of inflammation. The innate immune Complement (C′) pathways can recognize acute infected (AI) cells and result in their lysis, but the relative sensitivity of PI cells to C′-directed killing is incompletely understood. Here, we extended our previous studies on the interactions of C′ with parainfluenza virus AI and PI A549 cells to two additional respiratory tract cell lines. AI Hep2 and H1975 cells infected with Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) were found to be highly sensitive to C′ lysis. By contrast, PIV5 PI cells were highly resistant to killing by C″. Surface deposition of membrane attack complex (MAC) and C3 was also greatly reduced on the surface of PI cells compared to AI cells. PI cells had lower levels of surface viral glycoprotein expression compared to AI cells. Treatment of AI cells with ribavirin (RBV) showed a dose-dependent decrease in both viral glycoprotein expression and sensitivity to C′-mediated lysis. When surface viral glycoprotein levels were reduced in AI cells to those in PI cells, AI cells became similarly resistant to C′. While sialic acid levels on PI cell surfaces matched that of naïve cells, enzymatic removal of this sialic acid did not increase sensitivity to C′-mediated lysis. Despite their varying profiles of C′ activation and deposition, these studies indicate downregulation of viral gene expression as a common mechanism of C′ resistance across various parainfluenza virus PI cell lines.">

        <tr id="Background The complement system is an important defense mechanism against pathogens, including viruses. In COVID-19, evidence suggests that hyperactivation of the complement system can lead to tissue damage and provoke dysregulation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in vascular damage observed in severe COVID-19. There is still little evidence regarding the role of plasma levels of these molecules in the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods The study included individuals 18 years of age or older with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, admitted to two referral hospitals in the Northeast Region of Brazil between August 2020 and July 2021. Plasma samples were collected within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were followed up until discharge, and complications during hospitalization were duly recorded. Plasma levels of the following complement proteins were determined by Luminex: C2, C3, C3b/iC3b, C4, C4b, C5, C5a, MBL, C1q, factor I, factor D, factor B, and factor H. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to correct the results according to possible confounding factors. Results The study included 267 patients (134 critical and 133 severe), with mean ages of 54 and 52 years, respectively. Plasma levels of C2, C5a, factor B, and factor D were significantly higher in patients who required intensive care unit admission, required ventilatory support, developed sepsis, developed cardiorespiratory arrest, or developed acute kidney failure. On the other hand, C4b level was lower in patients who developed complications. Complement proteins were significantly associated with laboratory parameters related to coagulation and kidney function. Conclusion These findings show that the complement system is associated with COVID-19 complications and laboratory parameters of coagulation and kidney function. These results suggest that these molecules may be potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in the clinical progression of COVID-19.

Stimulation index (SI) based on the percentages of CD4+ T lymphocytes with effector memory phenotype CD45RA−CD27− (TEM) was quantified by flow cytometry.Patients with IEI overall, as well as the two main groups of PAD [i.e., common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and isotype or functional antibody deficiencies (IOFD)], showed frequencies of responder individuals and median SI against SARS-CoV-2 comparable to HCHC. However, those IEI and CVID subgroups positive for anti-CMV T-cell immunity showed a significantly reduced response (SI) against S-peptides when compared to their IEI and CVID counterparts who were anti-CMV TEM negative. This effect of CMV stratification is independent of age in our patient group.CMV latency negatively impacted the CD4+ TEM population’s functionality regarding COVID-19 vaccination in patients with CVID. Our results in patients with IEI and previous similar findings in healthy populations highlight the fact that when assessing immune-specific responses, the inclusion of CMV monitoring is suitable, is worthwhile, and may potentially be extended to vaccinations against different pathogens to prevent human disease more accurately.">

        <tr id="Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is increasingly recognized as a modulator of infection severity, yet its impact on the immune response in severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) remains poorly understood. In this prospective cohort study of 108 adults with sCAP, we evaluated the prevalence and prognostic impact of MASLD and performed pathogen-stratified immune profiling of cytokines and semaphorins on hospital days 1 and 5. MASLD was present in 50% of patients and independently associated with early respiratory failure (OR 3.8) and vasopressor-dependent shock (OR 4.0), despite similar sCAP severity at baseline. MASLD patients exhibited distinct immune profiles, including elevated baseline serum levels of SEMA3A, SEMA7A, IL-2, IL-10, IL-17A, CXCL10, and TGF-β1, and reduced SEMA5A. By day 5, the MASLD group exhibited a greater decline in pro-inflammatory mediators compared to non-MASLD patients but failed to upregulate reparative mediators such as SEMA4D and TGF-β1, unlike the non-MASLD group. These kinetics may suggest a maladaptive immune response in MASLD, potentially consistent with early immune exhaustion. Immunokinetic patterns were pathogen-specific, including transient increase in IL-17A and IL-10 in Legionella and Mycoplasma infections, and CXCL10, IL-2, IL-17A, TGF-β1 and IL-10 in influenza. Serum IL-10, CXCL10, SEMA3F, SEMA4D and SEMA7A correlated with organ failure and sCAP complications. These findings underscore the clinical importance of the lung–liver axis and suggest that semaphorins could serve as valuable prognostic biomarkers for identifying high-risk patients.">

        <tr id="Roughly 1 billion people are infected by Influenza A viruses (IAVs) worldwide each year, resulting in approximately half a million deaths. Particularly concerning is the threat of IAV spillover from avian and other animal reservoirs. The recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in US dairy cows highlights this concern. While viruses that enter human populations from such zoonotic transmission typically lack the ability to transmit effectively between humans, they may be only a few mutations from acquiring this capacity. These newly adapted viruses have the potential to be significantly more virulent than seasonal strains. A major contributor to influenza pathology is the over-exuberant immune response to the virus, particularly when the infection is present in distal pulmonary tissues. Maladaptive immune pathway over-activation can drive tissue damage and pathology, often independently of effective viral control. Anti-inflammatories targeting host-initiated pathological processes hold promise, but these avenues require a thorough understanding of virus-triggered lung inflammation before they can be fully exploited. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the cell types that are targeted by IAV, the consequences of IAV infection on the biology of these cells, and their contribution to lung pathology in influenza. We will also discuss how virus-induced hyper-inflammatory responses present new entry-points for therapeutic intervention, showcasing Z-form nucleic acid-binding protein 1 (ZBP1)-initiated necroptosis as an example of one such pathway.">

BACKGROUND

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with an overactive immune response, contributing to disease severity. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays a central role in mediating inflammatory responses during viral infections, including COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES

This computational reanalysis explores the critical involvement of NF-κB signaling, particularly through toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and noncanonical pathways, in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, immune activation, and cytokine storm. We also discuss the crosstalk between NF-κB and other signaling pathways in the context of COVID-19, and summarize current and potential therapeutic strategies targeting NF-κB.

METHODS

An extensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, TLR signaling, NF-κB pathway activation, noncanonical NF-κB signaling, and anti-inflammatory drug interventions were analyzed and synthesized.

RESULTS

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, often facilitated by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease activity. This viral entry triggers downstream immune signaling cascades, especially through TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8. TLR engagement activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. NF-κB signaling exhibits extensive crosstalk with other pathways, including Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome (NLRP3) activation, contributing to cytokine storm and lung injury. Several pharmacological agents, including corticosteroids, Inhibitor of κB Kinase ( IKK) inhibitors, and repurposed drugs like dexamethasone and resveratrol, show potential in mitigating NF-κB-mediated inflammation.

CONCLUSION

NF-κB signaling serves as a pivotal mediator of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and immune dysregulation. Targeting this pathway—particularly its noncanonical branches and TLR-mediated activation—offers promising therapeutic avenues. Understanding NF-κB crosstalk with other immune pathways may yield synergistic drug targets to improve COVID-19 outcomes.">

        <tr id="Significance Understanding factors driving asymptomatic versus severe disease is of key importance if we are to control emerging and re-emerging viral infections. As preexisting CD8+ T-cell responses have been associated with asymptomatic COVID-19 in individuals expressing HLA-B*15:01, comparing to mild disease, we defined cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells responses directed at the HLA-B*15:01/S919 epitope in COVID-19 patients across disease outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to critical illness. We found that severe COVID-19 patients had an enrichment of an alternate T-cell receptor (TCR) motif compared to the key public motif expanded in milder patients. Our study provides evidence on differential nature of TCR clonal repertoire in 22.37% of HLA-B*15:01-positive COVID-19 patients who developed severe/critical disease in our cohorts, comparing to HLA-B*15:01-expressing individuals with mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2, originally described as a respiratory pathogen, has been identified as a multisystem disease with complex and interconnected pathophysiological processes. Methods: The PRISMA framework was used to systematically review the evidence and identify and synthesize it in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases between January 2020 and May 2025. Of the 1410 screened records, 161 peer-reviewed studies involving more than 2 million patients were included in the analysis. The frequency of organ involvement, important biomarkers, and long-term outcomes were derived, and the quality of the studies was assessed using standardized tools. Results: The quantitative synthesis showed that 78%, 32%, 43%, and 28% of hospitalized patients had pulmonary, cardiovascular, 43% neurological, and 28% renal issues, respectively, with 10–35% showing persistent organ dysfunction at 6 months post-infection. The most common were cytokine storm (IL-6 (Interleukin-6) > 100 pg/mL in 72% of severe cases), endothelial dysfunction (biomarkers elevated in 87% of patients), and microvascular thrombosis (D-dimer > 2000 ng/mL in 46% of patients). Most domains were scored as having moderate-to-high confidence in the quality assessment. Conclusions: COVID-19 has long-term, multi-organ sequelae that require integrated multidisciplinary management. Healthcare systems should be ready to participate in long-term monitoring, rehabilitation, and special therapeutic development. The results offer a strong evidence base for clinical practice and post-pandemic health policy.">

Multi-organ proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses reveals upregulation of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory pathways in skin lesions and across multiple organs, especially in immune-related tissues. Abnormal activation of DNA replication and cell cycle signaling pathways, which may contribute to enhanced viral replication, is evident in both MPXV and SIV-MPXV co-infected groups. CDK4/6 may present a potential therapeutic target to suppress MPXV replication.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in late 2019 as the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has triggered a global public health crisis. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is one of the key host factors mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and invasion. The inhibitors against TMPRSS2 emerge as a promising therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 and other potential viral infections. However, the precise mechanism of action for TMPRSS2 inhibitors remains unclear, with studies on structural optimization being notably scarce. In this work, multiple molecular simulation strategies were employed to systematically compare binding details and conformational changes of the representative inhibitors (i.e., camostat and nafamostat) with those of TMPRSS2 at the atomic level, thereby proposing potential inhibitory mechanisms underlying their activity differences. Compared with camostat, nafamostat is more likely to form a stable covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate. Next, a series of derivatives were designed with the same core structure (i.e., 4-guanidino benzoyl). And finally, the novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor with potentially better performance was identified based on the principle of the lowest binding free energy. This work not only elucidates the inhibitory mechanisms of camostat and nafamostat, showing valuable theoretical insights, but also proposes a viable strategy for future molecular design, thereby exhibiting promising application prospects.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Understanding the durability of immunity induced by mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, especially in individuals with chronic health conditions, remains essential for guiding booster strategies. We conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses up to 21 months after a primary two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination followed by a booster, either homologous (BNT162b2) or heterologous (mRNA-1273). Methods: Twenty-eight adults, mostly with chronic conditions, were assessed at approximately 9, 12 and 21 months post-primary vaccination. Serum anti-trimeric Spike IgG levels were quantified, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed at 21 months for Spike-specific memory B-cell and T-cell responses by flow cytometry. Results: Participants were stratified by booster type, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and health status. Anti-Spike IgG persisted in all participants but declined over time. The heterologous mRNA-1273 booster induced higher antibody titers at 9 months, while the homologous BNT162b2 booster led to more sustained antibody levels and higher frequencies of Spike-specific memory B cells at 21 months. Prior infection significantly enhanced antibody titers, particularly in homologous booster recipients. Surprisingly, individuals with chronic health conditions exhibited equal or higher antibody levels compared to healthy participants at all time points. At 21 months, robust Spike-specific class-switched memory B cells and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that BNT162b2 vaccination elicits durable, multi-layered immunity lasting nearly two years, even in individuals with chronic conditions, and support the use of both homologous and heterologous mRNA boosters to sustain protection in diverse populations.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in over 6 million deaths worldwide in fewer than four years and is a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The protein that mediates SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is highly expressed on the membrane of gastrointestinal (GI) cells. Consequently, infection can lead to direct damage to the GI tract and gut dysbiosis, which is associated with an imbalance of microbiota, inflammation, and other systemic infections and diseases. In this review, we will focus on the impact of COVID-19 on the GI system. We will examine the pathophysiology of gut dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients, as well as emphasize the significance of probiotics in addressing this condition. Additionally, we will identify key areas of interest that warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="Acute human alpha-herpesvirus 1 (HSV-1) infection culminates in a latent infection of neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and the central nervous system. Following infection of mucosal epithelial cells, certain neurons survive infection and life-long latency is established. Periodically, stressful stimuli trigger reactivation from latency, which result in virus shedding, transmission to other people, and, occasionally, recurrent disease. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) comprise a feed-forward transcriptional loop that cooperatively transactivate key HSV-1 promoters that drive expression of infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), ICP4, and ICP27. Silencing KLF15 significantly reduces HSV-1 replication in cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells. Consequently, we hypothesized that KLF15 mediates certain aspects of reactivation from latency. To test this hypothesis, we compared HSV-1 replication in KLF15−/− mice versus wild-type (wt) parental C57BL/6 mice. Virus shedding during acute infection was reduced in KLF15−/− mice. Male KLF15−/− mice shed higher titers of virus during late stages of reactivation from latency compared to KLF15−/− females and wt mice regardless of sex. At 15 d after explant-induced reactivation, virus shedding was higher in male KLF15−/− mice relative to wt mice and female KLF15−/− mice. These studies confirm KLF15 expression enhances viral replication during acute infection and reactivation from latency.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the critical need for broad-spectrum antivirals with high resistance barriers. Here, we demonstrate that SB431542, a selective TGF-β receptor I (ALK5) inhibitor, exhibits potent antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through unprecedented multitargeted mechanisms. Through comprehensive in vitro, isothermal titration calorimetry, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupts its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This interaction restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36–48 hours post-infection [hpi]), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-β-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release—processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 751.8 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favorable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-β/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-β-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection, collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for antiviral drugs with high barriers to resistance. This study reveals that SB431542, a drug previously developed to inhibit TGF-β signaling, exhibits remarkable effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 through an unprecedented triple-mechanism approach. Unlike conventional antivirals that target a single viral component, SB431542 simultaneously disrupts viral entry, assembly, and release by binding to the viral ORF3a protein and modulating host cellular processes. Most importantly, SARS-CoV-2 failed to develop resistance against SB431542 even after 50 generations of exposure—a significant advantage over current therapeutics that quickly lose effectiveness due to viral mutations. Our findings also uncover that coronaviruses exploit both lysosomal dysfunction and programmed cell death to spread efficiently, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. This research establishes SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor and demonstrates the value of targeting host-virus interactions to overcome antiviral resistance.">

        <tr id="Background Gastric cancer remains one of the most prevalent and lethal cancers worldwide, with its insidious onset hindering early diagnosis and effective treatment. Despite advances, the overall survival rate for gastric cancer remains low, primarily due to late diagnosis, tumor heterogeneity, and resistance to current therapies. This highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Methods Gastric cancer cell lines were treated with securinine, followed by analysis of cell proliferation, cycle, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) using Western blot and immunofluorescence techniques. Transcriptomic analysis was performed to identify changes in ferroptosis-related iron metabolism pathways. In vivo studies were conducted using xenograft mouse models to assess tumor growth. Results Securinine significantly inhibited proliferation and modulated the cell cycle, arresting cells at the G2/M transition, while also enhancing EMT, which altered cell migration and invasiveness. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that securinine activated ferroptosis-related iron metabolic pathways, upregulating key genes such as HMOX1, FTH1, and FTR. Inhibition of these genes reversed the effects on cell proliferation and EMT, highlighting the role of ferroptosis in the anticancer effects of securinine. In vivo studies demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor growth in xenograft models. Conclusions Securinine shows potential as a novel therapeutic agent for gastric cancer by inducing ferroptosis and modulating key cell death and survival pathways. Its ability to regulate iron metabolism and EMT suggests that it could be a promising candidate for developing new therapeutic strategies against gastric cancer, especially for drug-resistant cases.">

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via ACE2 in upper respiratory tract the virus entries by binding to the spike protein. Uncontrolled activation and enhancement of the immune response leads to massive release of cytokines and chemokines known as cytokine storm (CS).

        <tr id="Background: Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread intracellular protozoan that can cause chronic infection in immunocompetent hosts, leading to subclinical neuroinflammation. Understanding the immunopathogenesis of chronic cerebral toxoplasmosis requires well-characterized animal models. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate infection severity, affected immune cell populations, and cytokine response in both early and late chronic phases of T. gondii infection. Methods: A murine model was developed by infecting C57BL/6 mice with a sub-infective dose (104 tachyzoites) of the ME49 strain. Forty mice were used: 30 infected and 10 controls. Animals were sacrificed on days 30, 60, and 180 after infection. Brains were analyzed using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Histopathological changes, including gliosis, meningitis, vasculitis, and neuronal degeneration, were most prominent on days 30 and 60 and decreased by day 180. Immunohistochemistry revealed dynamic changes in immune cell populations (CD4+, CD8+, CD11b+, CD11c+, CD19+, and FOXP3+) and cytokine expression (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18). A mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory response was observed, shifting toward immunoregulation at day 180, with increased FOXP3+ cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines. PCR confirmed T. gondii DNA in all infected groups. Conclusion: This model shares several immunopathological features with chronic cerebral toxoplasmosis observed in immunocompetent humans, modeling aspects of the infection even in the absence of demonstrable tissue cysts. The immunological shift from pro-inflammatory to regulatory responses highlights the mechanisms of immune modulation and persistence. This study provides a useful platform to explore host-pathogen interactions and CNS immune dynamics in chronic cerebral toxoplasmosis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Women are disproportionately affected by neuropsychiatric symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19. However, whether there are central nervous system-specific changes in gene expression in women with neuropsychiatric Long COVID (NP-Long COVID) remains unknown.


METHODS
Twenty-two women with and ten women without NP-Long COVID were enrolled from New Haven, CT, and the surrounding region and consented to a blood draw and large volume lumbar puncture. Total RNA was extracted from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Polyadenylated RNA was sequenced, and differential expression analyses were performed.


RESULTS
Both CSF and PBMC samples showed differential gene expression associated with Long COVID status. There were CSF-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in people with Long COVID, including in genes related to oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, and P53 response, indicating compartment-specific immune responses. Some pathways were dysregulated in both the CSF and PBMC of Long COVID compared to controls, including those related to androgen response, MTORC1 signaling, and lipid metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
Women with NP-long COVID show compartment-specific, transcriptional profiles in the CSF with evidence of enrichment in cellular stress pathways. These results underscore the importance of examining CSF-specific molecular profiles to better understand post-viral neurological syndromes.">

This paper analyzed the current literature related to long-term manifestations of COVID-19 and aimed to identify the common symptoms reported four weeks or more after the initial onset of the disease. COVID-19 has been shown to have lasting systemic effects on an array of organ systems, such as the lungs, heart, brain, and gastrointestinal systems. Common symptoms include, but are not limited to, fatigue, brain fog, respiratory difficulties, and loss of taste and smell. The impact of COVID-19 on multiple organ systems is thought to be associated with its ability to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors throughout the body and promote cytokine release. This study provides insight into common long-term manifestations of COVID-19. Future studies should look at how long COVID-19 syndrome affects various subpopulations differently.">

        <tr id="Long COVID manifests with heterogeneous clinical outcomes, potentially linked to immune dysfunction. However, the recovery of immune-cell subsets during convalescence remains incompletely understood.In this longitudinal cohort, 279 unvaccinated patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (13 mild, 218 moderate, 48 severe) were enrolled. Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry at admission and at 50 days post-symptom onset (DPSO 50).Total T-cell counts normalized in 90–98% of patients in the moderate and severe groups by DPSO 50. Nevertheless, a subgroup exhibited persistent B-cell lymphopenia (<90 cells/µL) in 7.3% of moderate cases (median 77.1 cells/µL, IQR 51.9–83.8) and 12.5% of seltvere cases (median 54.5 cells/µL, IQR 28.4–79.3). Patients with B-cell deficiency also showed concurrent reductions in total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD4+CD25+CD127low/FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). In moderate cases, CD4+ T cell and Treg counts correlated positively (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), independent of B-cell status, whereas this relationship was absent in severe cases, indicating severity-dependent immune dysregulation.Approximately 7–12% of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 survivors displayed persistent lymphopenia affecting B cells, CD4+ T cells, and Tregs at ~50 days post-symptom onset. These findings highlight distinct recovery trajectories and provide insights into Long COVID pathogenesis that may inform therapeutic strategies.">

In this paper, we present and study three mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations of virus and immune system interactions with different complexities, and also introduce possible treatments. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model. We do global sensitivity analysis and numerical simulations. Finally, we present conclusions including comments about the complexity of mathematical models.">

        <tr id="Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) remain a major cause of global morbidity and mortality, yet accurate pathogen identification and risk stratification continue to pose clinical challenges. Lipidomics—the comprehensive analysis of lipid species within biological systems—has emerged as a promising tool to unravel host–pathogen interactions and reveal novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from nine original studies applying mass spectrometry-based lipidomic profiling in human LRTIs, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Across diverse study designs, sample types, and analytical platforms, consistent alterations in lipid metabolism were observed. Perturbations in phospholipid classes, particularly phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), were frequently associated with disease severity and immune activation. The ratios of PC to LPC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) emerged as markers of inflammatory remodeling. Sphingolipids—including sphingomyelins (SMs) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)—were identified as key modulators of monocyte and neutrophil activation. Fatty acid–derived lipid mediators such as oxylipins (e.g., 12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and acylcarnitines reflected pathogen-specific immune responses and mitochondrial dysfunction. Several lipid-based classifiers demonstrated superior diagnostic and prognostic performance compared to conventional clinical scores, including the CURB-65 and pneumonia severity index. However, significant heterogeneity in experimental design, lipid identification workflows, and reporting standards limits inter-study comparability. While preliminary findings support the integration of lipidomics into infectious disease research, larger multi-omic and longitudinal studies are required. This review provides the first comprehensive synthesis of lipidomic alterations in human LRTIs and highlights their emerging translational relevance.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, cause severe infections of the respiratory system. Cohort studies and clinical observations indicate that patients with severe influenza A virus (IAV) infections are at an increased risk of developing an ischemic stroke event. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To this end, we investigated the consequences of IAV infection on cerebral damage in a mouse model of ischemic stroke.


METHODS
We intranasally inoculated male C57BL6/N mice with the mouse-adapted IAV strain A/Puerto Rico 8/34 or PBS as a vehicle control. At 3, 7, and 10 days post-infection, mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by sacrifice 24 hours after reperfusion for subsequent analysis. The anticoagulant drug acetylsalicylic acid was administered as treatment 1 day before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.


RESULTS
Our research demonstrated a time-dependent deterioration of cerebral ischemia after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, resulting in increased infarct volume and a worsened neurological outcome at the propagation and inflammation phases of infection. Our observations revealed an elevation in procoagulant activity and an increase in thrombosis within the microvasculature after infection and stroke. This effect was attributed to an infection-mediated inflammatory milieu and accelerated neutrophil response. Upon infection, the release of increased neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils had detrimental consequences for transient middle cerebral artery occlusion development. Administration of acetylsalicylic acid or control antiviral therapy prevented the IAV-induced exacerbation of stroke and reduced brain damage by reducing NETosis and coagulation.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that IAV infections enhance the systemic propensity for NETosis and foster a procoagulant state, thereby increasing the risk of cerebral damage and thrombosis following stroke. Targeting a combination of neutrophils and coagulation molecules simultaneously represents a promising treatment approach for clinical stroke.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant global impact on the respiratory system and multiple organ systems, including the nervous system. Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection and its vaccines have been increasingly recognised, ranging from problems with smell and taste to more severe conditions such as encephalitis, stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. This narrative review critically evaluates the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 infection and its vaccines, providing insights into potential pathophysiological mechanisms. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, and data were retrieved from various databases. The prevalence, types, and severity of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients were discussed. The possible mechanisms of neurological injury in COVID-19 were explored, including direct viral invasion, hypoxic brain injury, immune-mediated damage, and cerebrovascular injury. Furthermore, the review addressed the neurological complications associated with COVID-19 vaccination. While severe vaccine-related adverse effects remain rare, understanding their occurrence is essential for risk assessment and public health interventions. In conclusion, COVID-19 can affect the nervous system in various ways, leading to various neurological symptoms. Further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of these manifestations and develop effective preventive and treatment strategies to manage this global health crisis.">

        <tr id="Abstract The obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii is estimated to infect a third of the world’s population. Toxoplasmosis is considered a significant worldwide disease that can lead to morbidity or death in immunocompromised individuals. Host defense against T. gondii has been demonstrated to be dependent on a rapid myeloid cell and lymphocyte response working in concert to quickly eliminate the invading pathogen. Classically, T-bet–dependent group 1 innate lymphocytes (ILC1s), natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+ T cell–derived interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are considered indispensable for host resistance against T. gondii. However, recent discoveries have illustrated that T-bet is not required for NK cell– or CD4+ T cell–derived IFN-γ. Yet, lack of T-bet still results in rapid mortality, pointing to a T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–mediated host defense pathway. This review summarizes the myeloid cell–mediated immune response against T. gondii and provides insights into the lesser known components of the T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–dependent host defense pathway for pathogen clearance.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in global morbidity and high mortality rates worldwide. According to case histories, for a long time after acute COVID-19 infection (six months to 2-3 years), patients may experience a pronounced fatigue, increased tiredness, higher incidence of acute respiratory viral infections per year, increased recurrence of skin diseases, allergies, exacerbation of pulmonary disorders, urinary tract diseases, increased recurrence of chronic viral diseases, e.g., herpesvirus and papillomavirus infections, aggravation of chronic cardiovascular and other somatic diseases of various organs and systems. Patients were examined at early as six months after recovery from acute COVID-19. Such persistent post-infectious consequences are referred to as post-COVID syndrome. When assessing post-COVID syndrome, it is necessary to identify the main clinical syndromes of multiorgan pathology characteristic of post-COVID patients. Endocrine and cardiac manifestations of post-COVID syndrome may be a consequence of direct damage from viral infection, immunological and inflammatory damage, as well as iatrogenic complications. Objective of our study was to assess the impact of acute COVID-19 severity on the course of post-COVID syndrome. The research objectives were as follows: 1. To analyze the severity of clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disorders in post-COVID patients depending on the degree of lung damage in the acute period of COVID-19 (CT0 to CT4). 2. To analyze the severity of clinical manifestations of endocrine disorders, including newly diagnosed pathology, in post-COVID patients depending on the degree of lung damage in acute period of COVID-19. Since we did not found any significant gender-and age-dependent differences, all patients were divided into groups by the degree of lung damage during acute period of COVID-19, according to clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection. This study showed that the clinical picture of post-COVID syndrome is characterized by a pronounced diversity in development of multiple organ pathology, both newly diagnosed, or manifesting by increased frequency of exacerbations of chronic diseases. Conclusions: 1. According to the data obtained, reliable differences were obtained between groups CT0 and CT1-2, as well as CT0 and CT3-4: the frequency of exacerbating cardiovascular disorders in the post-COVID period is significantly higher in groups with lung damage over acute period of COVID-19 compared to the group of patients without lung damage. These data suggest that cardiovascular disorders are directly related to the severity of COVID-19, viral load, and were detected most frequently (68%) in post-COVID patients who initially had a severe coronavirus infection. 2. According to our results, the frequency of glucose metabolism disorders, including those detected for the first time, proved to be significantly increased in the post-COVID patients with lung damage during acute infection. Meanwhile, no significant differences were found for thyroid disorders, except of autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). These disorders may be associated with usage of corticosteroid therapy in acute period of coronavirus infection, or with impairment of regulatory mechanisms of the endocrine and immune systems induced by SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus again confirming our assumptions concerning development of multiple organ pathology in post-COVID patients.">

This study examines the effects of maternal COVID-19 vaccination on physical development, behavior, and neurogenesis in mouse offspring. After inoculation with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero Cell) at gestational day 14.5, antibodies were detected in the serum of dams and pups. At one month of age, offspring of vaccinated dams—but not controls—showed enhanced working memory, increased neural proliferation, neuroblast formation, stem cell activity, and more mature neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG). Luminex assay showed elevated hippocampal IFN-γ and CX3CL1, both linked to neurogenesis and memory. Conditional knockout experiments identified microglial IFNγR1 and CX3CR1 as key mediators of neuronal development through regulating microglial activation and chemotaxis. These findings suggest maternal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination transiently enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and working memory in offspring, without causing neurodevelopmental risk.">

After a decade of declining mortality rates from cancer in the US, from 2020, registered age-standardized cancer-related deaths and mortality increased for all cancers. Cancer cell ‘dormancy’ results from an equilibrium between tumor cell division and apoptosis, and provides an explanation for relapse and metastasis that can occur months, years, or decades after treatment. In July 2025, findings from a study in mice infected with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 showed the rapid loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast carcinoma cells in the lung, and expansion of metastatic carcinoma cells within weeks. Animal model findings support findings in cancer survivors that SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung metastasis and cancer-related mortality. This Editorial aims to highlight findings from real-world population studies on the association between COVID-19 and cancer and new experimental findings for how SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and possibly other respiratory viruses may ‘awaken’ dormant cancer cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral replication in most people living with HIV‐1 (PLWH). However, PLWH remain at risk of viral rebound. HIV‐1 infection modifies the content of extracellular vesicles (EVs). The changes in microRNA content in EVs are biomarkers of immune activation and viral replication in PLWH. Moreover, viral molecules are enclosed in EVs produced from infected cells. Our objective was to assess the value of EV‐associated HIV‐1 RNA as a biomarker of immune activation and viral replication in PLWH. Plasma samples were obtained from a cohort of 53 PLWH with a detectable viremia. Large and small EVs were respectively purified by plasma centrifugation at 17 000g and by precipitation with ExoQuick. HIV‐1 RNA and microRNAs were quantified in the EV subtypes by RT‐qPCR. HIV‐1 RNA content was higher in large EVs of ART‐naive PLWH. Small EVs HIV‐1 RNA was equivalent in ART‐naive and ART‐treated PLWH and positively correlated with the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio. In ART‐naive PLWH, HIV‐1 RNA content of large EVs correlated with small EV‐associated miR‐29a, miR‐146a, and miR‐155, biomarkers of viral replication and immune activation. A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that HIV‐1 RNA in large EVs discriminated PLWH with a high CD8 T cell count. HIV‐1 RNA in large EVs was associated with viral replication and immune activation biomarkers. Inversely, HIV‐1 RNA in small EVs was related to immune restoration. Overall, these results suggest that HIV‐1 RNA quantification in purified EVs could be a useful parameter to monitor HIV‐1 infection.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a major global public health challenge, with pathogens such as influenza viruses, novel coronaviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus exerting serious threats to human health. These infections often progress to severe disease in children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immunity. Due to their anatomical exposure and relatively weak mucosal defenses, the upper respiratory tract—including the nasal cavity and throat—serves as a primary portal of entry for these pathogens. Such infections can lead to otolaryngological conditions such as anosmia and otitis media, and may further exacerbate illness in susceptible populations. After viral invasion, the host perceives pathogens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), rapidly activating the expression and signaling pathways of type I and type III interferons (IFN). This plays a core role in antiviral defense. Notably, viral infection profoundly reshapes the host cell’s metabolic network, involving widespread alterations in carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. During this process, key metabolic products are released or generated. These are the products of metabolic reprogramming and important immune regulatory molecules that can directly or indirectly modulate the host’s antiviral immune response, particularly the interferon pathway. These findings reveal that viral invasion, host metabolic reprogramming, and interferon-mediated antiviral immunity form a tightly intertwined, and dynamically interact a regulatory network of”virus-metabolism-IFN”. This profoundly elucidates the underlying regulatory logic of the metabolic microenvironment in antiviral immunity. Understanding this mechanism offers new perspectives for diagnosis and treatment: targeting metabolic nodes or utilizing metabolic modulators, as well as combined strategies with IFN, and may become novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of upper respiratory viral diseases. This review focuses on the core role of IFN-mediated innate immunity in viral defense and its interactive regulation with metabolic reprogramming. It reviews the progress of studies on how metabolic products regulate the IFN pathway and antiviral responses through various mechanisms, and explores the potential clinical application prospects of metabolic regulation in local immune defense and the prevention and treatment of viral infections.">

        <tr id="People living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (PLWH) may develop HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) despite the use of antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, more studies are needed to identify novel therapies, which require a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying HIV neurotoxicity. The HIV envelope protein gp120 causes neuronal degeneration similar to that observed in HAND. One mechanism contributing to gp120-mediated neurotoxicity may involve its ability to inhibit protein processing in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To provide data in support to this hypothesis, we have used a variety of experimental approaches to investigate the effect of gp120 on ER dynamics. We first analyzed the levels of ER stress-associated proteins, such as immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) and phosphorylated Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 alpha (p-IRE1α) by western blot, as well as ER morphology by electron microscopy in gp120 transgenic (tg) mice. We found that the hippocampus of gp120tg mice exhibits an increase of BiP levels and p-IRE1α, as well as altered ER morphology when compared to wild type mice. We confirmed that gp120 alters ER morphology in neurons by using rat cortical neurons in culture. The effect of gp120 was chemokine-co-receptor dependent because AMD3100, a CXCR4 receptor antagonist, abolished the effect of gp120 on BiP immunoreactivity. Moreover, using Gluc-ASARTDL, a reporter protein for monitoring ER calcium, and live Ca2+ imaging, we show that gp120 induces ER Ca2+ depletion in neurons. Overall, our data suggest that gp120 promotes ER stress in neurons.">

COVID-19, or the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, affects glucose metabolism to a great extent. Recent studies have reported that hyperglycemia and glucose control disorders among patients with COVID-19 can increase the severity of infection, mainly in individuals with prior chronic non-fatal conditions including diabetes. The aim of this study is to assess some glucose biomarkers as Random Blood Sugar and Fructosamine levels that might be useful in COVID-19 patients during acute phase of infection and recovery. This study included 150 participants: 100 COVID-19 patients (50 males, 50 females) and 50 controls in Baghdad from November 2021 to June 2022. Blood samples were collected during the acute (1-3 weeks) and recovery phases (4-6 weeks) of infection. Random Blood Sugar, Glycated Hemoglobin, and Fructosamine levels were measured using a fully automated biochemical analyzer (INTEGRA-400 plus by Roche). The significant sex differences in glucose biomarkers in acute and recovery phases of COVID-19 patients were shown by this study. In the acute phase, Random blood sugar (RBS) levels were significantly more elevated in males to 382.98 ± 160.37 mg/dl compared with females 207.96 ± 65.38 mg/dl while similar trends were seen in HbA1c and fructosamine level respectively.) During recovery phase high glucose levels persist in males as well which clearly indicate the stronger effect of COVID-19 on glucose metabolism might be more in males. These results highlight the need to follow the glucose profiles in individuals with COIVID-19, and especially in men. The study reveals that COVID-19 patients often experience compromised glucose regulation, particularly in males. Compared to females, males have higher blood RBS, HbA1c, and fructosamine levels, making them more susceptible to high blood glucose levels. Post-recovery, glucose profiles remain elevated, especially in males, making them more susceptible to diabetes and other metabolic complications. Fructosamine is more useful as a follow-up indicator.

        <tr id="The cytokines interleukin (IL)-22 and IL-17 are secreted by innate and adaptive immune cells to drive “type III” responses that protect against extracellular pathogens, promote mucosal barrier integrity, and foster microbiota homeostasis. However, dysregulation of IL-22 and/or IL-17 contributes to autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, and malignancy. Thus, a deeper understanding of mechanisms regulating type III cytokine production could provide new therapeutic targets for a spectrum of immune-mediated diseases. Toward this goal, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screen to identify factors that regulate IL-22/IL-17 expression in a murine type III innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) model, MNK3, following stimulation with IL-23 and IL-1b. In addition to previously known regulators of type III cytokines, including IL-23 receptor components IL23R and IL12RB1, the screen identified a large set of new factors that either potentiate or attenuate expression of IL-22 and/or IL-17. A subset of these novel factors was chosen for validation, from which two were selected for further study. The nuclear protein, SON, which binds both DNA and RNA, impaired expression of IL12RB1 at the levels of de novo transcription and RNA processing. The second, MAP4K1 (HPK1), is a serine/threonine kinase that is required for IL-22 but not IL-17 expression. Depletion of MAP4K1 in MNK3 also enhanced expression of the type I cytokine, IFNg, which was co-expressed with IL-17, a phenotype reminiscent of pathogenic Th17 cells. Together, results from the CRISPRi screen broaden our understanding of the factors involved in type III immune responses and offer new targets for modulating IL-22/17 expression.">

        <tr id="Background Glucocorticoid (GC) signaling plays a crucial role in immune regulation during critical illness, but cell-specific responses remain poorly understood. While previous studies have predominantly examined glucocorticoid receptor (GCR)-α and GCR-β, the roles of alternative isoforms (GCR-γ, GCR-P) and the downstream effectors GC-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) and dual-specific phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) across different immune cell populations in critical illness remain unexplored. Methods In this prospective, observational study, we enrolled 43 critically ill patients and 25 healthy controls. Longitudinal blood samples were collected at ICU admission (24–48 h) and days 4 (4d), 8 (8d), and 14 (14d). We quantified the mRNA expression of four GCR variants (GCR-α, GCR-β, GCR-γ, and GCR-P) and GC downstream targets (GILZ and DUSP1) in isolated polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) via RT‒PCR. Serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10) were measured concurrently. Statistical analyses included mixed-effects modeling to assess temporal and cell-specific patterns. Results PMNs exhibited sustained downregulation of GCR-α, GCR-β, and GCR-γ, with preserved GILZ expression, while GCR-P remained stable. In PBMCs, GCR-α, GCR-β, GCR-γ, and GILZ levels showed no significant changes compared to controls, yet GCR-P was upregulated. DUSP1 was downregulated in PMNs and elevated in PBMCs. Negative correlations emerged between IL-6 and both GILZ and DUSP1. All expression patterns remained stable across time points in the subset of patients who completed the 2-week study despite dynamic ACTH changes and persistently elevated cortisol. Conclusions PMNs show reduced GCR-α/β/γ with preserved GILZ, while PBMCs maintain GCR-α/β/γ but upregulate GCR-P and DUSP1. These findings highlight divergent GC responsiveness between innate and adaptive immune cells, with implications for cortisol’s role in immune regulation during critical illness and may reflect cell-specific effects driven by changes in glucocorticoid receptor signaling.">

        <tr id="Abstract The central nervous system (CNS) serves as a sanctuary for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which is facilitated by HIV's ability to breach the blood–brain barrier (BBB). BBB dysfunction occurs in the earliest stages of an HIV‐1 infection. The immune‐privileged CNS reduces harmful inflammatory responses, detrimental to the neuronal environment. BBB disruption, however, contributes to comorbidities in HIV, like cerebrovascular disease and neurocognitive problems. A 2‐dimensional in vitro BBB model was employed to assess the effect of HL2/3 cell paracrine factors on select physiological parameters: cell proliferation, viability, toxicity, suppression, and morphology. BBB integrity was assessed using transendothelial electrical resistance measurements. The study utilized immortalized mouse brain endothelial cell monocultures and co‐cultures with the HL2/3 cell line, emulating an in vivo HIV‐1 effect on the BBB. A concentration‐dependent decline in cellular proliferation rates and viability was observed upon exposure to HL2/3 paracrine factors. Moreover, an elevation in cellular suppression, cell death, and cell toxicity was observed. Permeability studies confirmed decreased impermeability after exposure to HIV‐1 viral proteins in select in vitro BBB model systems. The impact of HIV viral proteins on brain capillary endothelium is critical to elucidate pathogen‐induced cerebrovascular disease progression and vascular cognitive impairment in patients.">

        <tr id="Introduction Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, has emerged as a major public health concern following the COVID-19 pandemic. Although initially perceived as a respiratory illness, growing biomedical evidence confirms that COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems. This study aimed to explore the clinical manifestations, risk factors, and long-term outcomes associated with long COVID and to identify patients at highest risk. The research also contributes to the ongoing discourse on establishing a unified definition of long COVID. Methods A secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, community-based study was conducted using data from 168 households, representing a weighted total of 14,769 households in Third Ward, Houston, Texas. Data were collected via interviewer-administered surveys and included variables on demographics, pre-existing comorbidities, COVID-19 symptom severity, and post-acute symptom persistence. Symptom variables were recoded as binary indicators, and weighted logistic regression models were applied to identify associations between acute phase characteristics and the development of long COVID. Results Risk factors significantly associated with long COVID included symptom severity during acute infection (OR = 29.58, 95% CI [1.38, 632.53]), heart disease (OR = 6.00, 95% CI [1.15, 31.28]), asthma (OR = 3.49, 95% CI [1.05, 11.59]), and poor physical health (OR = 4.20, 95% CI [1.12, 15.75]). Acute symptoms predictive of long COVID included anxiety (OR = 22.94, 95% CI [2.01, 262.31]), chest pain (OR = 7.15, 95% CI [1.13, 45.23]), constipation (OR = 16.81, 95% CI [1.33, 213.23]), heart palpitations (OR = 6.59, 95% CI [1.08, 40.18]), and shortness of breath (OR = 4.97, 95% CI [1.16, 21.36]). No statistically significant associations were found between long COVID and race, education, or income. Conclusion The findings underscore the multisystemic nature of long COVID, characterized by a diverse range of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive impairment, shortness of breath, and neuropsychiatric issues such as depression. While clinical factors are critical in understanding long COVID, the results also suggest that addressing associated health outcomes requires broader consideration of social determinants of health.">

        <tr id="During the acute-phase of COVID-19, elevated levels of several acute-phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), mannose-binding lectin (MBL), pentraxin 3 (PTX-3), serum amyloid A (SAA) and surfactant protein D (SP-D), are associated with severe to fatal clinical outcomes. Typically, these markers return to baseline within days after resolution of the acute infection.In this study, we assessed the plasma levels of these proteins in a well-defined cohort of 141 COVID-19 convalescent patients 10 weeks after infection and compared them to 98 non-infected controls. In addition, we performed genetic analyses in a subgroup of patients and related the findings with structural equation modelling to disease severity. In contrast to other acute-phase proteins, PTX-3 levels were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 convalescent patients than in the control group. Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited PTX-3 levels above 5000 pg/ml even 10 months post-infection, compared to those with mild disease. To explore potential genetic influences, a genetic analysis was performed on all severely affected patients (n=36) and on an age- and sex-matched subset of mild COVID-19 patients (n=38). Results revealed a significantly higher frequency (p<0.0001) of the homozygous wildtype genotype of the PTX-3 SNP rs971145291 in severe (15 out of 36) versus mild (1 out of 38) COVID-19 patients. Using structural equation modelling, the association of this PTX-3 genotype and disease severity was shown to be mediated by elevated PTX-3 levels, with no contribution from other analyzed (clinical) confounders. In summary, severe COVID-19 patients show high PTX-3 serum levels which may be influenced by genetic predisposition, specifically the absence of the rs971145291 SNP variant. PTX-3 may thus serve both as a biomarker for tissue damage and/or long-term immune activation and eventually post-COVID-19 complications.">

        <tr id="Immune dysregulation is one of the main causes of severe coronavirus infection COVID-19. The immune response in COVID-19 is characterized by the activation of innate immune cells and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukins-1, -6, -8), neutrophils, C-reactive protein and ferritin. Organ dysfunction, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, is associated with cytokine storm. Another important sign of immune dysregulation is lymphopenia, one of the key predictor of the development of severe COVID-19 and poor outcome. One of the main causes of lymphopenia in patients with severe COVID-19 is apoptosis of lymphocytes. The increased proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the induction of lymphocytes apoptosis and lymphopenia. The clinical role of lymphocytes apoptosis in COVID-19 is associated with the immunosupression and the opportunistic and secondary infectious diseases. The immunosupression in severe COVID-19 is confirmed by the results of morphological studies demonstrating the depletion of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue. Next important cause of lymphopenia is lymphocyte sequestration in the lungs. Postmortem studies of the lungs of patients died from COVID-19 show the lymphocytic infiltration. Additionally, lymphopenia may result from impaired lymphopoiesis due to virus-induced damage to lymphocyte precursors in the bone marrow and thymus. In COVID-19 patients, there is a significant reduction in the production of T-cells in the thymus. The decreased thymic function may exacerbate lymphopenia in patients during the acute phase of COVID-19 and prolong the time required for the recovery of circulating T-cell counts.">

        <tr id="Abstract Nowadays, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), featuring clinical manifestation of fever with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and multiple organ function impairment, has been paid more and more attention. It has become the pandemic for a few years and a quantity of people died of it. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection may lead to the development of SFTS, which is characterized by decreased counts of lymphocyte subsets, especially T cells, B cells and natural killer cells, and disruptive release of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. However, the deeper mechanism of this disease remains unidentified. To excavate the mechanisms of lymphopenia in SFTSV infection and to introduce the potential therapeutics, this paper focuses on lymphopenia as well as reviews the mechanisms and effects of lymphopenia caused by SFTSV infection, mainly through making analogies with other similar viruses to explain the details of programmed cell death. Other factors such as IL-6,IL-10, TNF-α and some vital immunocytes also play significant roles in eliciting lymphopenia. Eventually, the probable clinical implications have been discussed, mentioning that lymphopenia induced by multiple pathways in SFTSV infection may be associated with the severity of viral disease and opportunistic infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract The role of type I interferon (IFN) in mediating tumor immunosurveillance, in situ vaccination, and response to other cancer immunotherapies is well established. The biologic and species-specific differences between type I IFN family members have not been sufficiently addressed. Recombinant IFN-α2 has been approved for the treatment of chronic viral infections (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus) and some forms of cancer. IFN-β was approved to treat patients with multiple sclerosis but failed in the treatment of chronic viral infections or cancer. These distinct therapeutic applications most likely reflect distinct biologic roles of the individual IFNs that unfortunately remain poorly understood. IFN-β can be secreted by essentially all nucleated cells activated through most pattern recognition receptors (PRR). By contrast, IFN-α is predominantly secreted by the P1 subset of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which mediate viral defense and successful cancer immunotherapy following their activation by toll-like receptor (TLR)7 or TLR9 agonists. The biologic effects of TLR7 and TLR9 agonists depend critically on their structure and their ability to be processed by endosomal nucleases into fragments capable of binding two distinct agonist binding sites. The clinical activity of TLR7 and TLR9 agonists in cancer immunotherapy is associated with their induction of IFN-α secretion and P1 pDC differentiation. CD8+ T cells likely evolved for the primary purpose of killing viral/retroviral-infected cells. Immune cells detect viral/retroviral infected cells using TLR7 and TLR8 to distinguish viral GU-nucleotide-rich RNA from self-RNA modified with pseudouridine, and TLR9 to distinguish viral unmethylated CpG DNA from self-DNA modified with 5-methylcytosine. Recent studies have defined antagonist pockets in TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 that bind degradation products of endogenous modified RNA and DNA to inhibit responses to host nucleic acids. These findings point to a role for TLR7/8/9 acting cooperatively to enable innate immunity to distinguish retroviral particles from apoptotic blebs, with important implications for optimising in situ vaccination and other cancer immunotherapy strategies, and treating systemic autoimmune diseases mediated by the inappropriate activation of TLR7/8/9 by apoptotic debris.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the cause of the global pandemic of 2019–2023. Despite the fact that COVID-19 primarily affects the lung tissue, cardiovascular complications are not uncommon both at the height of the disease, and in the post-COVID period. The presence of previous cardiovascular diseases and advanced age of the patient are proven risk factors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. 
AIM: Based on the analysis of the current literature sources, to determine the role of mast cell proteases in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. 
Excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by mast cells in the new coronavirus infection conditions the initiation of a severe systemic inflammatory response that affects not only the lung tissue, but also the myocardium. One most significant mechanism of the development of cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19 is endothelial dysfunction of the microcirculatory system with the formation of ischemic areas with subsequent local apoptosis of cardiac myocytes. 
CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 develop primarily due to the damaging effect of proinflammatory cytokines, the production of which is stimulated by proteases of activated mast cells. Because of small amount of published data, additional investigation is required.">

        <tr id="Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus affecting 10–20 million people worldwide. While many carriers remain asymptomatic, HTLV-1 infection can trigger intense inflammatory responses which are defined by the sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Central to this process is the HTLV-1 encoded Tax oncoprotein, a viral regulator that drives uncontrolled inflammation by hijacking multiple cellular signaling pathways, such as the RelA/NF-κB signal transduction pathway. CD4 T-cells are the primary targets of Tax-mediated transformation, undergoing uncontrolled proliferation and significantly contributing to chronic immune activation seen in HTLV-1-associated diseases. However, highly activated CD4 T-cells are not alone in fueling this inflammatory “wildfire.” Other immune cells, including CD8 T-cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, also play critical roles in exacerbating the inflammatory milieu. These cells, in conjunction with CD4 T-cells, release a barrage of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α/β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-α/β, and IFN-γ) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α/β, RANTES, MCP-3, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), all of which are perpetuating the cycle of immune activation and tissue damage. This hyper stimulated immune response contributes to HTLV-1 replication/dissemination and can lead to the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM-TSP). Despite existing treatments aimed at controlling viral replication, the persistent inflammation in HTLV-1-infected individuals even in asymptomatic carriers (ACs) remains a major challenge, suggesting that targeting these pro-inflammatory responses may be another mandatory therapeutic strategy. In this context, this short-review focuses on the key immune responses that drive HTLV-1-associated inflammation and explores how these high pro-inflammatory responses contribute to the development of HTLV-1-related complications, including HAM-TSP, ATLL, and other associated inflammatory diseases during chronic viral infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Sepsis remains a major clinical challenge, often resulting in long‐term physiological and immunological disturbances. This study employed high‐throughput single‐cell Raman spectroscopy to analyze the biochemical profiles of peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with non‐COVID‐19 and COVID‐19‐associated sepsis. Leukocytes were assessed at multiple timepoints, including the acute phase (Days 3 and 7 after sepsis onset) and late recovery phase (6 and 12 months after sepsis onset). Raman spectroscopic profiles of leukocytes showed clear separation between healthy controls and sepsis patients during the acute phase with high balanced accuracy (BAcc: 95%–98%). Spectral differences between acute and recovery phases (BAcc: 84%–97%) and between recovery‐phase leukocytes and those from healthy controls (BAcc: 81%–90%) were also observed, indicating long‐lasting molecular alterations. Furthermore, distinct profiles were identified between non‐COVID‐19 and COVID‐19‐associated sepsis during the acute phase (BAcc: 65%–71%) and in the late‐recovery phase (BAcc: 71%–83%). These findings demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy enables label‐free, high‐throughput profiling of leukocyte biochemistry across the sepsis trajectory. This suggests that Raman spectroscopy is a promising tool for high‐throughput screening, offering insights into the biomolecular changes in sepsis and providing a diagnostic platform to differentiate between sepsis etiologies, a significant advancement in the field of sepsis diagnostics.">

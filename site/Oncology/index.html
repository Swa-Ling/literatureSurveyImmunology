        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Human microglial heterogeneity has been largely described using transcriptomic data. Here, we introduce a microglial proteomic data resource and a Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing panel enhanced with antibodies targeting 17 microglial cell surface proteins (mCITE-Seq). We evaluated mCITE-Seq on HMC3 microglia-like cells, induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG), and freshly isolated primary human microglia. We identified novel protein microglial markers such as CD51 and relate expression of 101 cell surface proteins to transcriptional programs. This results in the identification and validation of three protein marker combinations with which to purify microglia enriched with each of 23 transcriptional programs; for example, CD49D, HLA-DR and CD32 enrich for GPNMBhigh (“disease associated”) microglia. Further, we identify and validate proteins - SIRPA, PDPN and CD162 – that differentiate microglia from infiltrating macrophages. The mCITE-Seq panel enables the transition from RNA-based classification and facilitates the functional characterization and harmonization of model systems.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T-cells are essential for controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet their antigen-specific resolution in relation to disease severity, functional dynamics during acute infection, and long-term memory formation remain incompletely understood. Using comprehensive longitudinal profiling of 553 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic antigens across globally prevalent HLAs, we identified antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses that were either critical for early viral clearance or associated with severe disease outcomes. During acute infection, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a broader and more robust CD8+ T-cell response than those with mild disease. Notably, we identified HLA-A1-restricted immunodominant antigen-specific T-cells strongly associated with severe disease. These T-cells were present at extremely high frequencies but showed significantly reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules at both the transcriptomic (PRF1, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY) and protein levels (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2), as revealed by multidimensional single-cell and cytokine profiling. In contrast, patients with mild disease had T-cells that recognized a more restricted set of antigens, showed only partial overlap with those in severe cases, and showed enhanced cytotoxicity, along with enrichment in gene sets associated with cytotoxic function, hypoxia, and glycolysis. Furthermore, the long-term memory CD8+ T-cells were maintained for a limited subset of immunodominant antigens, with their persistence correlating with their initial frequency during infection. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following infection expanded the long-term T-cell repertoire by enhancing pre-existing responses and generating de novo responses, regardless of prior disease severity. These findings resolve the antigen-specific kinetics and durability of CD8+ T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide key insights into their functional landscape. This knowledge could inform future vaccine strategies and therapeutic interventions to enhance protective immunity against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 has claimed more than 7 million lives worldwide and has been associated with prolonged inflammation, immune dysregulation and persistence of symptoms following severe infection. Understanding the T cell mediated immune response and factors impacting development and continuity of SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T cells is pivotal for developing better therapeutic and monitoring strategies for those most at risk from COVID-19. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of memory T cells in a convalescent cohort (n=20), three months post Omicron infection. Utilising flow cytometry to investigate CD4+CD45RO+ and CD8+CD45RO+ memory T cell IL-2 expression following Omicron (B.1.1.529/BA.1) peptide pool stimulation, alongside T cell receptor repertoire profiling and RNA-Seq analysis, we have identified several immunological features associated with hospitalised status. We observed that while there was no significant difference in median CD4+CD45RO+ IL-2+ and CD8+ CD45RO+ IL-2+ memory T cell count between subgroups, the hospitalised subgroup expressed significantly more IL-2 per cell following Omicron peptide pool exposure in the CD8+CD45RO+ population (p <0.03) and trended towards significance in CD4+CD45RO+ cells (p <0.06). T cell receptor repertoire analysis found that the non-hospitalised subgroup had a much higher number of circulating clonotypes, targeting a wider range of predominantly MHC-I epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Several immunodominant epitopes, conserved between both subgroups, were observed, however hospitalised individuals were less likely to express putative HLA alleles responsible for pMHC presentation which may impact TCR affinity. We observed a bias towards shorter CDR3 segments in TCRβ repertoire analysis within the hospitalised subgroup, alongside lower rates of repertoire overlap in CDR3 sequences compared to the non-hospitalised subgroup. We found a significant proportion of TCRs targeted epitopes along the SARS-CoV-2 genome including non-structural proteins, responsible for viral replication and immune evasion. These findings highlight how the continuity of T cell based protective immunity is impacted by both the viral replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 upon intracellular and innate immune responses, and HLA-type upon TCR affinity and clonotype formation. Our novel Epitope Target Analysis Pipeline (Epi-TAP) could prove beneficial in development of new therapeutic strategies through rapid identification of shared immunodominant epitopes across non-hospitalised and hospitalised subgroups.">

        <tr id="Background : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains a public health challenge worldwide. The gastrointestinal tract has emerged as an important site of infection and has been implicated as a reservoir for long-term infection, particularly for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. However, whether vaccine-induced systemic antibodies can prevent intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Compared to Vero cells commonly used to assess SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, the intestinal epithelium has a functional interferon response and expresses higher levels of ACE2, enzymes, and antibody-binding Fc receptors that may impact SARS-CoV-2 immune elimination. Methods : We evaluated the potential of antibodies from both naturally infected and vaccinated human subjects to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of the intestinal epithelium. Serum samples were collected from human volunteers who had undergone natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 (n=5) or who had received the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (n=13). Banked sera collected in 2016 served as negative controls (n=2). SARS-CoV-2 (WA01, Delta or Omicron) was pre-treated with sera and then used to infect iPSC-derived human intestinal organoids (HIO) or Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was quantified by plaque assay, PCR, or immunofluorescence (IF) after 48-96 h. Results: Both HIOs and Caco-2 cells supported robust infection with SARS-CoV-2. In HIOs, pretreatment of SARS-CoV-2 with a high titer post-vaccine serum completely blocked replication of WA01. Similarly, sera from both naturally infected donors collected in 2020 and sera from individuals who had received a BNT162b2 vaccine significantly inhibited replication of the WA01 strain in Caco-2 cells. In contrast, none of the sera significantly inhibited infection with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. For Omicron, only sera from individuals who had received an Omicron-based vaccine significantly inhibited infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the plaque assay. Across all virus types, sera from individuals who had received Omicron-based BNT162b2 boosters were the most effective at reducing infection in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that vaccine-induced antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective in the gut. Our study also supports previous reports indicating that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines need to be adapted to circulating virus strains to convey full protection from infection.">

        <tr id="Even though vaccines protected many from infection, not all were protected, and vaccinated individuals displayed a wide range of clinical outcomes, from complete protection against infection to multiple breakthrough infections. This study aimed to identify baseline differences following identical ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1/BNT162b2 in infection-free and breakthrough-infected individuals to find molecular signatures linked to enhanced SARS-CoV-2 protection. Samples from a previous longitudinal study were analyzed, classifying subjects as ‘Protected’ or ‘Infected’ based on infection status over two years. SARS-CoV-2–specific immunological assays and single-cell RNA sequencing evaluated baseline differences. Although humoral response measurements showed no significant difference, enhanced cellular responses via enzyme-linked immunospot assays were observed in the Protected group. Differentially expressed genes and pathway analysis of T/NK subsets showed the Infected group had reduced inflammation and interferon responses. The Infected group also displayed downregulated interaction with CD4+ T cells. B subset analysis revealed more memory B cells in the Infected group, accompanied by downregulation of immune regulatory genes and upregulation of the small ubiquitin-related modifier pathway. Our findings revealed differential molecular signatures in the baseline immune subsets of vaccinated individuals with prolonged protection and breakthrough infection. Reduced immune regulation and altered cell interactions may contribute to breakthrough infection, providing insights for future vaccine development and targeted protective strategies.">

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak revealed the susceptibility of elderly patients to respiratory virus infections, showing cell senescence or subclinical persistent inflammatory profiles and favoring the development of severe pneumonia. Methods In our study, we evaluated the potential influence of lung aging on the efficiency of replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as determining the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of the distal lung tissue. Results Using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from donors of different ages, we found that pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 IAV replicated in the lung parenchyma with high efficacy. In contrast to these IAV strains, SARS-CoV-2 Early isolate and Delta variant of concern (VOC) replicated less efficiently in PCLS. Interestingly, both viruses showed reduced replication in PCLS from older compared to younger donors, suggesting that aged lung tissue represents a suboptimal environment for viral replication. Regardless of the age-dependent viral loads, PCLS responded to H5N1 IAV infection by an induction of IL-6 and IP10/CXCL10, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and to H1N1 IAV infection by induction of IP10/CXCL10 mRNA. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 IAV infection were not causing detectable cell death, H5N1 IAV infection led to more cytotoxicity and induced significant early interferon responses. Conclusions In summary, our findings suggest that aged lung tissue might not favor viral dissemination, pointing to a determinant role of dysregulated immune mechanisms in the development of severe disease.

        <tr id="Background Dengue encephalitis, a severe neurological complication of dengue virus infection, is increasingly recognized for its rising incidence and significant public health burden. Despite its growing prevalence, the underlying mechanisms and effective therapeutic strategies remain poorly understood. Methods Cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis was determined by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Viral load of dengue virus and the level of cytokines expression was detected by RT-qPCR. The target cells of dengue virus were verified by immunofluorescence. The cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cell was determined by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion, adoptive transfer and CCK-8-based cell viability assay. Axonal and synaptic reduction induced by dengue virus infection was demonstrated by RT-qPCR, Western blot, transmission electron microscope and immunofluorescence. Finally, motor and sensory functions of mice were detected by open field test and hot plate test, respectively. Results In this study, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing on brain tissues from a dengue-infected murine model to construct a comprehensive cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis. Our findings identify neurons, particularly inhibitory GABAergic subtypes, as the primary targets of dengue virus. Additionally, immune cell infiltration was observed, contributing to significant neurological damage. Comprehensive analyses of cell-cell communication, combined with CD8+ T cell depletion and transfer restoration experiments, have elucidated the critical role of CD8+ T cells in triggering encephalitis through their interaction with neurons. These cells infiltrate the brain from peripheral circulation, interact with neurons, and induce damage of synapse and axon, accompanied by neurological dysfunction. Conclusion We defined cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis in mouse model and identified the primary target neuron of dengue virus. In addition, we demonstrated the significant cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cell, which leads to apoptosis of neuron and neurological dysfunction of mice. Our study provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding dengue encephalitis through advanced sequencing technologies. The insights gained serve as a foundation for future investigations into its pathogenesis and the development of targeted therapeutic approaches.

        <tr id="Viral encephalitis, resulting from neurotropic viral infections, leads to severe neurological impairment, inflammation, and exhibits high mortality rates with poor prognosis. Currently, there is a lack of effective targeted treatments for this disease, which poses a significant public health concern. SARM1 has been identified as the pivotal mediator of axonal degeneration and inflammation across various neuropathies, activated by an elevation in the NMN/NAD+ ratio. However, comprehensive in vivo investigations into the role of SARM1-mediated pathogenesis in viral encephalitis are still lacking. In this study, we established mouse models of viral encephalitis using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and rabies virus (RABV) as representative pathogens. Our findings demonstrate that neurotropic virus infections elicit robust axonal degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, and profound neuropathological damage in cortical neurons via the activation of SARM1. In mouse models of viral encephalitis, deletion or inhibition of SARM1 effectively preserved axonal morphology and maintained mitochondrial homeostasis, while also attenuating the infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes in the cortex. Consequently, these interventions ameliorated neuropathological damage and enhanced survival outcomes in mice. Our findings suggest that SARM1-mediated axonal degeneration and brain inflammation exacerbate the pathological progression of viral encephalitis. Therapies targeting SARM1 emerge as viable and promising strategies for protecting neuronal function in the context of neurotropic viral infections.

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses are the most common cause of infectious encephalitis and highly target neurons for infection. Our understanding of the intrinsic capacity of neuronal innate immune responses to mediate protective antiviral responses remains incomplete. Here, we evaluated the role of intercellular crosstalk in mediating intrinsic neuronal immunity and its contribution to limiting viral infection. We found that in the absence of viral antagonism, neurons transcriptionally induce robust interferon signaling and can effectively signal to uninfected bystander neurons. Yet, in two-dimensional cultures, this dynamic response did not restrict viral spread. Interestingly, this differed in the context of viral infection in three-dimensional forebrain organoids with complex neuronal subtypes and cellular organization, where we observed protective capacity. We showed antiviral crosstalk between infected neurons and bystander neural progenitors is mediated by type I interferon signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we then uncovered regions containing bystander neural progenitors that expressed distinct antiviral genes, revealing critical underpinnings of protective antiviral responses among neuronal subtypes. These findings underscore the importance of interneuronal communication in protective antiviral immunity in the brain and implicate key contributions to protective antiviral signaling.

        <tr id="Common neurological symptoms of COVID-19, such as anosmia, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction, depend on interactions between the peripheral and central nervous systems. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections. Highlights iPSC technology was employed to generate peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a valuable platform for studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on peripheral sensory neurons. Our findings demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant exerted both direct and indirect effects on peripheral sensory neurons. Virus exposure upregulated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in peripherin-positive neurons. Additionally, exposure to the virus or its S1 spike protein increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression and trafficking, leading to axonal degeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that BA.5 exposure enhanced cAMP signaling pathway, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels that led to the significantly damage on synapses and axon guidance. The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited TRPV1 activation and mitigated axonal damage, offering neuroprotective effects for sensory neurons exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

Among healthy children and adolescents, younger age is associated with higher URT expression of innate and adaptive immune pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces broad upregulation of URT innate and adaptive immune responses among children and adolescents. Peripheral blood responses among SARS-CoV-2-infected children and adolescents are dominated by interferon pathways, while upregulation of myeloid activation, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways is observed only in adults.

        <tr id="Microglia make important contributions to central nervous system (CNS) development, but the breadth of their distinct developmental functions remain poorly understood. The mouse retina has been a key model system for understanding fundamental mechanisms controlling assembly of the CNS. To gain insight into where and how microglia might influence retinal development, here we identified molecularly unique myeloid cell populations that are selectively present during development, and characterized their anatomical locations. Development-specific transcriptional states were identified using single-cell (sc) and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) across multiple timepoints. Transcriptional states were validated in vivo by histological staining for key RNA and/or protein markers. Several of these development-specific myeloid populations have been described before in brain scRNA-seq atlases but not validated in vivo, while others are unique to our retinal dataset. We identify two closely-related microglial populations, labeled by the Spp1 and Hmox1 genes, that are distinguished mainly by activity of the NRF2 transcription factor. Both types are present selectively within the developing retinal nerve fiber layer where they engulf neurons and astrocytes undergoing developmental cell death. Hmox1+ microglia were also localized selectively at the wavefront of developing vasculature during retinal angiogenesis, suggesting that developmental events associated with angiogenesis modulate NRF2 activity and thereby induce microglia to switch between the Spp1+ and Hmox1+ states. Overall, our results identify transcriptional profiles that define specific populations of retinal microglia, opening the way to future investigations of how these programs support microglial functions during development.">

        <tr id="With the continuous emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, long-lasting and broadly reactive cellular and humoral immunity is critical for durable protection from COVID-19. We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in relation to antibodies, infection outcome and disease severity and assessed its durability in a longitudinal cohort over a three-year time course. We identified pre-existing T cells reactive to the seasonal coronavirus (CoV) OC43 that cross-react with the conserved SARS-CoV-2 spike S813-829 peptide. These cross-reactive T cells increased in frequency following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and correlated with enhanced spike-specific T cell responses and significantly reduced viral loads. Furthermore, our data revealed that CoV-cross-reactive T cells were maintained as part of the long-lasting memory response, contributing to increased T cell frequencies against omicron variants. These findings suggest a functional role of CoV-cross-reactive T cells that extends beyond the initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, contributing to enhanced immunity against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion2 and systemic hyperinflammation3. The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Long COVID represents a significant global health challenge with an unclear etiology. Alongside accumulating evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, a symptomatic overlap exists between long COVID and mitochondrial disorders. However, the genetic underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID have not been previously explored. We employed whole genome sequencing to analyze 13 patients with severe long COVID to identify genetic defects related to mitochondrial function. We performed extracellular bioenergetics flux analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and proteomics to evaluate cellular bioenergetics and compared the results to those of healthy controls. Our investigation identified 10 variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 83 variants of unknown significance affecting a wide range of mitochondria‐associated biological functions. Bioenergetics flux analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed an altered ATP production rate in four long COVID patients compared to healthy controls. This study presents initial evidence of a potential underlying genetic predisposition to mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID while demonstrating altered cellular energy capacity in a subset of these patients. These findings open avenues for further research into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and pathology in patients suffering from long COVID and may pave the way for targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the leading inflammatory and non-traumatic cause of disability in young adults, with late-onset MS emerging in middle-aged patients often resulting in poorer treatment responses and worse prognoses. The calcium-binding protein S100B is elevated in MS patients, and its targeting has shown promise in reducing disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models. However, most studies on MS pathology have focused on young animal models, leaving a gap in understanding the effects of age and S100B ablation on disease progression throughout the lifespan. This study aimed to characterize EAE in mice of different ages, examining demyelination, inflammation, and immune responses to determine whether S100B ablation could mitigate MS pathogenesis across the lifespan. EAE was induced in six cohorts of C57BL/6 mice: young adults (3 months), older adults (6 months), and middle-aged (12 months), including corresponding S100B knockout (KO) groups, followed for 23 days. Upon sacrifice, spinal cords were assessed via immunohistochemistry and Real-Time qPCR, while splenocytes were analyzed for immune cell characterization. Results indicated a more severe disease course in 12-month-old mice, marked by increased gliosis, inflammation, and impaired microglial phagocytic activity. Notably, S100B absence reduced gliosis and inflammatory markers across all ages, with 12-month-old S100B KO mice showing increased regulatory T cells. These findings highlight the exacerbating role of age and elevated S100B in MS progression, underscoring the importance of identifying age-specific MS markers and therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities, making the advanced age as a major predictor of disease severity. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms explaining how old age represents a major risk factor remain elusive. To investigate this, we compared SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15–22 months) mice. Both groups of K18-ACE2 mice were intranasally infected with 500 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with analyses performed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infection (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, lung RNA-seq, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable differences, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance, reduced survival, and failure to recover weight loss due to infection. RNA-seq data suggested greater lung damage and reduced respiratory function in infected aged mice. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient antiviral response characterized by reduced Th1-associated mediators (IFNγ, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9) and diminished number of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. These findings indicate that aging affects antiviral immunity, leading to prolonged infection, greater lung damage, and poorer clinical outcomes. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.

        <tr id="Viral replication in endothelial cells is a hallmark of many viral diseases in humans and other animals, underscoring the importance of understanding cellular mechanisms that restrict viral replication and the associated consequences for vascular health. Pathogenic variants of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV, Isavirus salaris) target endothelial cells of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), causing severe systemic disease and major losses during outbreaks in aquaculture. To better understand the endothelial response to ISAV, we used single nucleus RNA-sequencing at pre-clinical (12 days post infection, dpi) and clinical (16 dpi) stages of infection. Our approach enables an assessment of transcriptomic responses for different endothelial subpopulations at unprecedented resolution. ISAV RNA was predominantly detected in endothelial cells, which, along with mononuclear phagocytes, showed the highest number of differentially regulated genes at both time points. At 12 dpi, differentially expressed genes in endothelial cells were enriched for pathways related to NOD-like receptor signaling, antiviral responses, and regulation of programmed cell death. By 16 dpi, we observed a shift toward enrichment of pathways associated with cellular senescence, apelin signaling, and insulin signaling. We identified two distinct infection-related states at both time points: a virus-permissive state characterized by upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, small GTPase signaling, and MAPK activity, and a bystander phenotype marked by activation of antiviral responses, immune signaling, and translational regulation. This study is the first to capture the individual cell type responses to ISAV infection, and to characterize the in vivo endothelial response to active viral replication at single-cell resolution in any species.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer-and region-specificity. In Parkinson’s disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance.

Using mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight; CyTOF), we analyzed immune cell responses to S1 subunit stimulation in PBMCs from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19. We examined correlations among identified cell populations, serum cytokine levels, and clinical parameters. Results Serum S1 subunit levels correlated with disease severity and inflammatory cytokine concentrations. S1 subunit stimulation induced dose-dependent cytokine production from PBMCs, predominantly from myeloid cells. CyTOF analysis identified classical monocytes with high CD147 expression (CD147hi cMono) as the primary source of S1-induced cytokines. The proportion of CD147hi cMono increased significantly in severe COVID-19 and decreased with clinical improvement. The frequency of CD147hi cMono showed a stronger positive correlation with clinical severity markers in younger patients compared to older patients. Conclusions CD147hi cMono are the primary cellular source of S1-induced inflammatory cytokines and may serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring COVID-19 severity and treatment response.

        <tr id="Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis, with a fatality rate of 20-50% in treated individuals. Although corticosteroid therapy can increase survival in HIV-negative people with TBM, better antimicrobial and host-directed therapies are required to improve outcome. There is, therefore, a need to better understand local immunopathologic pathways. Despite its power in identifying disease-specific cellular profiles, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been underutilized in cerebral samples in brain infection. We employed scRNA-seq to analyze fresh pretreatment cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from four TBM patients, along with paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). While 29 cell subtypes were present in both tissues, their relative abundance varied significantly. In particular, CSF was enriched with highly inflammatory microglia-like macrophages, GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells, and CD56bright NK cells. The latter two subsets exhibited features associated with dysfunctional cytotoxicity. Across multiple cell types, inflammatory signaling pathways were increased and oxidative phosphorylation was decreased in CSF compared to PBMCs. This study highlights the value of scRNA-seq for exploring CSF immunopathogenesis in TBM patients and offers a resource for future studies investigating the pathophysiology of TBM and other brain infections, including potentially targetable cell populations linked with immune-mediated pathology.">

        <tr id="Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2s) have recently been shown to exert key regulatory functions in both innate and adaptive immune response networks that drive the establishment and progression of type 2 immunity. Although mainly tissue resident, ILC2s and their crosstalk within tissue microenvironments influence metabolism at both the local and systemic levels. In turn, the energetic demand and metabolic status within these systems shape the diverse phenotypes and effector functions of ILC2s. Deciphering these metabolic networks in ILC2s is therefore essential in understanding their various roles in health as well as their associated pathophysiologies. Here we detail a framework of experimental approaches to study key immunometabolic states of primary murine ILC2s and link them to unique phenotypes and their corresponding functionality. Utilizing flow cytometry, Single Cell ENergetic metabolism by profilIng Translation inHibition (SCENITH), and the Seahorse platform we provide a framework that allows in-depth analysis of cellular bioenergetic states to determine the immunometabolic wiring of ILC2s. Connecting immunometabolic states and networks to ILC2 phenotypes and effector functions with this method will allow future in-depth studies to assess the potential of novel pharmaceutics in altering ILC2 functionality in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Human microglial heterogeneity is only beginning to be appreciated at the molecular level. Here, we present a large, single-cell atlas of expression signatures from 441,088 live microglia broadly sampled across a diverse set of brain regions and neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases obtained from 161 donors sampled at autopsy or during a neurosurgical procedure. Using single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF), we derived a 23-factor model for continuous gene expression signatures across microglia which capture specific biological processes (e.g., metabolism, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, inflammatory signaling, disease-associated states). Using external datasets, we evaluated the aspects of microglial phenotypes that are encapsulated in various in vitro and in vivo microglia models and identified and replicated the role of two factors in human postmortem tissue of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Further, we derived a complex network of transcriptional regulators for all factors, including regulators of an AD-related factor enriched for the mouse disease-associated microglia 2 (DAM2) signature: ARID5B, CEBPA, MITF, and PPARG. We replicated the role of these four regulators in the AD-related factor and then designed a multiplexed MERFISH panel to assess our microglial factors using spatial transcriptomics. We find that, unlike cells with high expression of the interferon-response factor, cells with high expression of the AD DAM2-like factor are widely distributed in neocortical tissue. We thus propose a novel analytic framework that provides a taxonomic approach for microglia that is more biologically interpretable and use it to uncover new therapeutic targets for AD.">

Evidence suggests that T1D is a heterogenous disease, where the type of antibodies first formed imply subtypes. Here, we followed 49 children, who subsequently presented with T1D and 49 matched controls, profiling single-cell epigenomics at different time points of disease development. Quantitation of cell and nuclei populations as well as transcriptome and open-chromatin states indicated robust, early, replicable monocyte lineage differences between cases and controls, suggesting heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion early among cases. The order of autoantibody emergence in cases showed variation across lymphoid and myeloid cells, potentially indicating cellular immune response divergence. The strong monocytic lineage representation in peripheral blood immune cells before seroconversion and the weaker differential coordination of these gene networks close to clinical diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early life as a critical phase in T1D development.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, including prolonged viral shedding and emergence of mutations. To investigate the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, seven SIV+ rhesus macaques were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 in all macaques was mild. SARS-CoV-2 replication persisted in the upper, but not the lower respiratory tract for 14 days post-infection. Animals showed impaired generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cells. Animals also displayed transient changes in microbial communities in the upper airway and gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 evolution was observed in the upper respiratory tract. This study demonstrates that SIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in rhesus macaques recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in PLWH. We show that SIV impairs anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, potentially leading to prolonged viral shedding, altered pathogenesis, and viral evolution. This highlights the importance of HIV status in COVID-19 and supports the use of this model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how B cell depleting therapies modulate the immune landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. This was accompanied by increases in TNFα messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFα treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different cell-type specific reprogramming as a result of B cell depletion treatment in MS.">

Here, we show that a defined, low complex bacterial community (OMM12) but not the general absence of microbes in germ-free mice leads to a more potent immune response compared to the microbiome of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice after a systemic viral infection with LCMV Clone-13. Consequently, gnotobiotic mice colonized with OMM12 have more severe LCMV-induced disease pathology but also enhance viral clearance in the intestinal tract. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of adoptively transferred virus-specific T helper cells and endogenous T helper cells in the intestinal tract reveal a stronger pro-inflammatory Th1 profile and a more vigorous expansion in OMM12 than SPF mice. Altogether, our work highlights the causative function of the intestinal microbiome for shaping adaptive anti-viral immunity with implications for vaccination strategies and anti-cancer treatment regimens.">

        <tr id="Long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection affect millions of people and strain public health systems. The underlying pathomechanisms remain unclear, necessitating further research in appropriate animal models. This study aimed to characterize the trajectory of lung regeneration over 112 days in the male hamster model by combining morphological, transcriptomic and functional readouts. We demonstrate that in the acute phase, SARS-CoV-2 Delta-infected, male, aged hamsters show a severe impairment of lung function at rest. In the chronic phase, similar impairments persisted up to 7 weeks post-infection but were only evident after exercise on a rodent treadmill. The male hamster model recapitulates chronic pulmonary fibrotic changes observed in many patients with respiratory long COVID, but lacks extra-pulmonary long-term lesions. We show that sub-pleural and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis as well as alveolar bronchiolization persist until 112 dpi. Interestingly, CK8+ alveolar differentiation intermediate (ADI) cells are becoming less prominent in the alveolar proliferation areas from 28 dpi on. Instead, CK14+ airway basal cells and SCGB1A1+ club cells, expressing cell proliferation markers, mainly populate alveolar bronchiolization areas at later time-points. We postulate that pulmonary fibrosis and SCGB1A1+ club cell-rich areas of alveolar bronchiolization represent potential risk factors for other diseases in long-COVID survivors.">

Although the mechanism driving disease development is not fully understood, current evidence indicates the essential functions of viral regulatory proteins. Among these, the p13 protein has previously been shown to localize to the inner mitochondrial membrane in T cells, altering mitochondrial biology and T-cell function. While CD4+ T cells are the primary cell target of HTLV-1 infection, genomic viral DNA has also been detected in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which orchestrate innate and adaptive immunity and play a critical role in protecting against virus-induce diseases by establishing the appropriate balance of pro and anti-inflammatory responses. Given the central role of mitochondria in monocyte differentiation, we investigated the effect of p13 in monocytes/macrophages and found that by localizing to mitochondria, p13 affects mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, we demonstrate that p13 expression affects macrophage polarization to favor the recruitment of CD4+ T cells, the primary target of the virus, potentially facilitating the spread of viral infection and the development of disease.">

        <tr id="Background Model organisms allowing for longitudinal examinations of liver disease pathogenesis are pivotal for the development of new therapeutic modalities. The eastern North American woodchuck develops chronic hepatitis and liver cancer after woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection, mirroring aspects of the natural history of the human hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, the cellular landscape of the woodchuck liver and the cell-level relevance of WHV infection to HBV infection is currently uncharacterized. Methods We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to generate an atlas of healthy woodchuck liver (63,389 cells, n=8) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (26,972 cells, n=7). Cell-specific and hepatic zonation gene signatures were validated using spatial transcriptomics (n=1). We employed our atlas to examine immune activation in stimulated precision cut-liver slices (PCLS) and disease-related pathway activation in chronic WHV infection (11,797 cells, n=3). We further employed our atlas to examine shared disease pathways between WHV infection and human HBV infection. Results Our atlas revealed woodchuck hepatic cellular diversity comparable to human and murine livers. Applying single-nucleus RNA-seq to PMA/ionomycin-stimulated precision cut liver slices revealed inflammation-associated activation signatures in T cell, myeloid and endothelial cell compartment. Finally, we describe intrahepatic T cells in chronic WHV hepatitis with both exhaustion and activation-associated signatures that resemble intrahepatic T cell genes signatures described in human chronic HBV. Conclusions We present a multi-omic atlas of healthy, diseased and ex vivo stimulated woodchuck liver. By identifying shared pathological processes between WHV and HBV infections, our findings reinforce the value of this preclinical model in translational research. This resource aims to advance studies on HBV pathogenesis and oncogenesis to speed the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Impact and Implications/Lay summary The liver plays important roles in metabolism, detoxification, and immune processes; liver transplantation is often the only treatment option for severe chronic liver diseases. Therefore, developing animal models that reflect human liver disease and can be studied throughout the disease course is crucial for the discovery of new treatment options. The woodchuck is an animal that develops chronic hepatitis and liver cancer after infection with woodchuck hepatitis virus, which models the human hepatitis type B virus infection (HBV) and associated hepatic carcinoma. However, our understanding of the cells that compose the woodchuck liver is limited, making it challenging to design and test cell-based therapeutics. In this study, we atlased the healthy and chronically infected woodchuck liver, found that liver cell types in woodchuck resemble those in humans, and employed the atlas to show similarities between WHV and HBV at the cell level, reinforcing the potential of WHV-infected woodchuck as a model for human HBV disease.

        <tr id="The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is highly heterogeneous, with interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression playing a dual role in antiviral defense and immune dysregulation. To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.">

        <tr id="Background Four influenza pandemics have occurred during the past 100 years, and new variants of influenza viruses will continue to emerge. The nasal mucosa acts as the primary site of exposure to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, but viral recognition and host immune responses in the nasal mucosa are still poorly understood. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the utility of non-invasive nasopharyngeal swabs for longitudinal monitoring of mucosal immune responses in pigs experimentally challenged with two swine-adapted and one human-adapted IAV. By tracking antiviral immune responses from disease onset to recovery, we sought to assess the feasibility of this method for capturing dynamic changes in viral load and host responses across different IAV strains. Methods Forty-two IAV-negative pigs were divided into four groups and housed separately for infection studies. Viral and host RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs was analyzed using microfluidic qPCR, while statistical analysis was performed with a Bayesian approach in R. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining was used to assess MUC5AC expression in the nasal mucosa of infected pigs. Results RNA was successfully isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs, enabling gene expression analysis to monitor innate immune responses to IAV infection. A classical innate antiviral immune response was demonstrated after the three virus infections including expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), transcription factors, interferons (IFNs), interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), cytokines, and chemokines. The kinetics and magnitude of immune responses varied between infections, with notable downregulation of mucins following infection with the Danish swine-adapted isolate. Further, the Danish isolate induced a fast but transient IFN-mediated response concurrent with high expression of cytokines and chemokines, while the other swine-adapted Mexican isolate induced a prolonged immune response of ISGs, cytokines, and chemokines. Conclusion This study highlights the significance of highly translational nasopharyngeal swabs as a non-invasive method for assessing mucosal antiviral immune responses. Utilizing microfluidic mRNA analysis, we gained valuable insights into antiviral mucosal responses across 216 swab samples collected from viral inoculation through recovery in three distinct influenza virus infections.">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism implicated in cardiac infection in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible.">

        <tr id="Lower respiratory infections, mostly caused by viral or bacterial pathogens, remain a leading global cause of mortality. The differences between animal models and humans contribute to inefficiencies in drug development, highlighting the need for more relevant and predictive, non-animal models. In this context, AlveolAir™, a fully primary in vitro 3D human alveolar model, was characterized and demonstrated the sustained presence of alveolar type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) cells. This model exhibited a functional barrier over a 30-day period, evidenced by high transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). These findings were further validated by tight junctions’ confocal microscopy and low permeability to Lucifer yellow, confirming AlveolAir™ as robust platform for drug transport assays. Additionally, successful infections with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses were achieved, and antiviral treatments with Baloxavir and Remdesivir, respectively, effectively reduced viral replication. Interestingly, both viruses infected only the epithelial layer without replicating in endothelial cells. These findings indicate AlveolAir™ as a relevant model for assessing the toxicity and permeability of xenobiotics and evaluating the efficacy of novel antiviral therapies.">

        <tr id="The understanding of how the host immune response differs in T-cell phenotype and memory formation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) remains limited. LTRs who recovered from COVID-19 infection without prior vaccination represent a unique population for studying immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Six LTRs with positive neutralizing antibodies (nAb+) and six LTRs with negative nAb (nAb-) were included at 6 months following COVID-19 infection. It was found that nAb+ LTRs had higher anti-RBD IgG titers and greater neutralizing percent inhibition compared to nAb- LTRs. Fifteen T-cell subsets were identified in COVID-19 convalescent LTRs, and it was shown that only terminal effector CD8+ - 3 decreased in the nAb+ group, while elevated IL-10 expression levels were found in the nAb- group. After stimulation with the SARS-CoV-2 XBB spike peptide pool in vitro, it was observed that the nAb+ group exhibited an increase in effector memory CD4+ cells with lower PD-1 expression, a reduction in effector memory CD4+ - 2 cells, and terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells, while the nAb- group showed high expression of CTLA-4 and IL-10 in terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells. Four SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell subsets were identified, with high expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ in terminal effector CD8+ - 1 and terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in both groups. Perforin was mainly detected in terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in nAb+ LTRs. In addition to these proportional differences, stem cell memory CD4+ cells with higher IL-17A expression and stem cell memory CD8+ cells with higher CTLA-4 expression were also found in nAb- LTRs. These findings suggest that LTRs who developed nAb+ following SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit stronger T-cell responses, with more robust immune activation and memory recall, compared to nAb- LTRs. This study underscores the importance of understanding T-cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 recovery for guiding vaccination strategies and managing immunity in LTRs.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID-19 vaccines are crucial in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and severe health outcomes. Despite widespread administration, their long-term systemic effects on human metabolism remain inadequately understood. This longitudinal study aims to evaluate IgG responses, 34 cytokines, 112 lipoproteins, and 21 low-molecular-weight metabolites in 33 individuals receiving two to four COVID-19 vaccine doses. Changes in metabolic profiles for the first 16 days post each dose of vaccine, and up to 480 days post-initial dose, were compared to baseline (before vaccination). Additionally, metabolic profiles of vaccinated participants were compared to a reference cohort of unvaccinated individuals without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection (controls) and SARS-CoV-2 cases. Positive IgG responses were observed in 78.8% (N = 26) of participants after the first dose, reaching 100% with subsequent doses. The most common side effects were localized pain at the injection site and “flu-like” symptoms, reported by > 50% of participants. Systemic side effects, e.g., sore lymph nodes, fatigue, and brain fog, were reported but showed no significant correlations to IgG responses. Transient temporal changes were observed for cytokine IP10 (CXCL10) and glutamic acid around the third vaccine dose. Compared to the reference cohort, 497 vaccinated samples (95.0%) had profiles similar to the controls, while the remaining 26 samples with prior infection exposures were similar to mild cases of SARS-CooV-2 infection. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination did not induce lasting changes in inflammatory and metabolic responses, nor did it induce changes similar to mild cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This supports the metabolic safety of the vaccine and contributes to increased vaccine confidence. Key messages Minimal changes in inflammatory/metabolic markers up to 480 days post-vaccination. Transient increase in IP10 (CXCL10) and glutamic acid around the third dose. Post-vaccination IgG response did not alter metabolic profiles like SARS-CoV-2 cases. Our findings provide insights into the safety of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly enhanced our understanding of CD8+ T cell immunity and their role in natural infection and vaccine-induced protection. Rapid and early SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses have been associated with efficient viral clearance and mild disease. Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses can compensate for waning, morbidity-related, and iatrogenic reduction of humoral immunity. After infection or vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells are formed, which mount an efficient recall response in the event of breakthrough infection and help to protect from severe disease. Due to their breadth and ability to target mainly highly conserved epitopes, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are also able to cross-recognize epitopes of viral variants, thus maintaining immunity even after the emergence of viral evolution. In some cases, however, CD8+ T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. In particular, delayed and uncontrolled, e.g., nonspecific and hyperactivated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses have been linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes. In this minireview, we summarize the tremendous knowledge about CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination that has been gained over the past 5 years, while also highlighting the critical knowledge gaps that remain.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells remains very limited. The contributions of intracellular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also unclear. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for IGFBP2, specifically in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2), in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we show that IGFBP2 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in primary AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions from patients with COVID-19-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alone or IPF with a history of COVID-19. Using multicolor immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 and its selective ligands IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly reduced in AEC2 cells from patients with COVID-ARDS, IPF alone, or IPF with COVID history than in those from age-matched donor controls. Further, we demonstrated that lentiviral expression of Igfbp2 significantly reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines—Tnf-α, Il1β, Il6, Stat3, Stat6 and chemokine receptors—Ccr2 and Ccr5—in mouse lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injury (S2; 500 ng/mL). Finally, we demonstrated higher levels of cytokines—TNF-α; IL-6 and chemokine receptor—CCR5 in AEC2 cells from COVID-ARDS patients compared to the IPF alone and the IPF with COVID history patients. Altogether, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IGFBP2 in AEC2 cells and its localized delivery may serve as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with COVID-19.

        <tr id="COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths globally; however, the characterization of molecular biomarkers of severe disease remains of great scientific importance. The aim of this study was to capture the transcriptional differences of the whole blood gene expression between COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease, using Next Generation Sequencing technologies, on admission and after 7 days. The genes which were differentially expressed in severe compared to mild patients were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Gene expression data were used to estimate the cell abundance of 22 immune cell types via digital cytometry. GO terms related to the response to molecules of bacterial origin, such as intestine-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were enriched, among other dysregulated pathways, which are well described as paramount mechanisms of severe manifestations of COVID-19. The neutrophil population increased in patients with severe disease, whereas the monocyte, CD8+ T cell, and activated Natural Killer (NK) cell populations were depleted. These cell population dynamics are also indicative of severe COVID-19 and intestinal bacterial translocation. This study elucidates the molecular basis of severe COVID-19 and highlights intestinal bacterial translocation as a potential driver of severe disease.">

        <tr id="Background Pregnant women are considered a high-risk population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as the virus can infect the placenta and embryos. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been widely reported to cause retinal pathological changes and to infect the embryonic retina. The infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is primarily mediated through spike (S) protein, which also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, it remains poorly understood how the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 affects retinal development, and the underlying mechanism has not yet been clarified. Methods We used human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids (hEROs) as a model to study the effect of S protein exposure at different stages of retinal development. hEROs were treated with 2 μg/mL of S protein on days 90 and 280. Immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR were performed to assess the influence of S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages. Results The results showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the receptors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, were expressed in hEROs. Exposure to the S protein induced an inflammatory response in both the early and late stages of retinal development in the hEROs. Additionally, RNA sequencing indicated that early exposure of the S protein to hEROs affected nuclear components and lipid metabolism, while late-stages exposure resulted in changes to cell membrane components and the extracellular matrix. Conclusion This work highlights the differential effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced developmental impairments in the human retina.

        <tr id="Introduction Porcine Circovirus (PCV2) infection is prevalent in pig farming and causes significant economic losses. In recent years, the PCV2d subtype has become the most prevalent genotype worldwide, exhibiting higher virulence, leading to more severe viremia and organ damage. Therefore, studying the biological characteristics of the PCV2d subtype is of great significance. Methods We established a PCV2d infection model using BALB/c mice and employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to systematically analyze the transcriptome of 10 cell types in the lung tissues of infected mice. We developed a comprehensive marker gene catalog for these cell types. Results Compared to uninfected mice, PCV2d infection induced extensive viral replication and immunosuppressive responses in most cell types. Monocyte macrophages with high levels of viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and various cell population interactions occurring through CD40-CD40L and CXCL14-CXCR4 were identified. These cells predominantly mediate antigen presentation and processing pathways in vivo, contributing to PCV2d-driven inflammatory lung injury. Discussion Our data uncovered a complex unique immune response scenario in the lung tissue of mice after PCV2d infection, deciphering the potential mechanisms underlying PCV2d-driven inflammatory responses in mice. Furthermore, this study provides a rich database for the molecular basis of different cell types' responses to PCV2d infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has highlighted the critical importance of understanding protective long-lasting immune responses. This study investigates the epitope specificity, T cell receptor (TCR) usage, and phenotypic changes in SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells over time in convalescent individuals with COVID-19. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 28 unvaccinated individuals with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (6 identified as the D614G variant, clade 20C) and analyzed up to 12 months post-symptom onset. Antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) using specific dextramer and antibody reagents. TCR clonotypes and activation markers were characterized to explore T cell dynamics. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited waning frequencies long-term, transitioning from memory-like to a naïve-like state. scRNAseq revealed specificity against both spike and non-spike antigens with increased CD95 and CD127 expression over time, indicating that naïve-like T cells may represent stem cell memory T cells, which are multipotent and self-renewing, likely important for long-lived immunity. TCR clonal expansion was observed mainly in memory T cells, with overlapping TCR beta chain (TRB)-complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences between participants, suggesting shared public TCR epitope-specific repertoires against SARS-CoV-2. Further, unique spike-specific CD4+ T cells with high CD95 and CD127 expression were identified, which may play a crucial role in long-term protection. Discussion This study highlights epitope-specificity heterogeneity, with some immunodominant responses, and suggests a potential role for long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. Shared TCR repertoires offers insights into cross-reactive and protective T cell clones, providing valuable information for optimizing vaccine strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings underscore the critical role of cellular immunity in long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and emphasizes the importance of understanding T cell dynamics.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely infectious respiratory virus and a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. MeV infection of the respiratory epithelium induces shedding of multinucleate epithelial cells from the apical surface of the epithelium without compromising epithelial barrier integrity. To study the mechanisms driving the apical extrusion of MeV-infected respiratory epithelial cells, we used primary differentiated tracheal epithelial cell cultures (rhTECs) and respiratory samples from rhesus macaques infected with wild-type MeV (WT MeV) or live-attenuated MeV (LAMV). We show that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling, rather than cell death or inflammasome activation, plays a key role in WT MeV and LAMV-induced cell shedding. Inhibiting S1P signaling resulted in delayed shedding of clusters of infected cells and higher viral titers within the epithelium, suggesting that cell extrusion impacts viral dynamics within the respiratory tract. We also found that shedding of individual infected cells began early after apical infection, prior to the formation of infected cell clusters within the epithelium. These findings offer new insights into MeV biology and pathogenesis within the respiratory tract. IMPORTANCE Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, measles virus (MeV) still has a significant global impact, and in 2022 alone led to over 136,000 deaths. MeV is one of the most contagious known viruses and spreads via the respiratory route. When respiratory epithelial cells are infected, they are shed into the lumen of the respiratory tract, but this process is poorly understood. Here, we use primary differentiated respiratory epithelial cells from rhesus macaques to show that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling, and not cell death or inflammasome activation, plays a role in cell shedding during both wild-type and live-attenuated MeV infection. Through this mechanism, MeV-infected cells are extruded without disrupting the integrity of the respiratory epithelium. Inhibiting S1P signaling resulted in delayed shedding of infected cells and higher viral titers in the epithelium. These findings indicate that host cellular responses play an important role in MeV infectivity.">

        <tr id="Background Our previous studies demonstrated that activated T cells accumulate in perihematomal regions following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and exacerbate hemorrhagic brain injury. In the present study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying brain-infiltrating T cell activation and the associated pathophysiological effects in neurological outcomes following ICH. Methods We employed standardized collagenase injection-induced and autologous blood injection models of ICH in male C57BL/6J mice. T cell receptor (TCR) activation, immune cell infiltration, and cytokine production were quantified through immunostaining, flow cytometry, and cytokine arrays at 1- and 3-days post-ICH. Brain edema volume was measured at 3 days post-ICH and neurobehavioral assessments were conducted up to 14 days post-ICH. Pharmacological inhibition of TCR activation was achieved using the TCR-specific inhibitor AX-024, administered intraperitoneally at a dosage of 10 mg/kg 1-hour post-ICH. Results Flow cytometry and immunostaining detected TCR activation of brain-infiltrating T cells. Specific TCR activation inhibitor AX-024 administration markedly reduced TCR activation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain at 1- and 3-days post-ICH. Moreover, AX-024 administration led to a significant reduction in the infiltration of other leukocyte populations, and significantly reduced brain edema while improved long-term sensorimotor and cognitive outcomes up to 14 days post-ICH. Discussion Our findings underscore the critical role of TCR activation in the mobilization and activation of brain-infiltrating T cells post-ICH. Inhibition of TCR activation via AX-024 administration might be developed as a promising therapeutic strategy to improve neurological outcomes following ICH. However, further research is necessary to thoroughly explore the complex pathophysiological processes involved.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is an immune-mediated non-infectious disease, and novel and robust biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnosis and prognostic outcomes of AE. Oxidative stress is a ubiquitous cellular process causing damage to various biological molecules. The aim of our study was to understand the clinical implication and mechanism underlying oxidative stress in AE. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on the serum of eight patients with AE and seven healthy controls, and oxidative stress was characterized. Experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) models were established in C57BL/6 and SJL mice for investigation of the therapeutic effect and mechanism of anti-oxidative stress N-acetylcysteine (NAC). We provided proteomic landscape in the serum of AE and identified antioxidant ALB, APOE, GPX3, and SOD3 as serum diagnostic markers of AE. The antioxidant markers were lowly expressed both in the serum of AE patients and central nervous system (CNS) of EAE mice. NAC administration improved clinical signs and motor function and alleviated nerve injury of EAE mice as well as lowered oxidative stress (decreased MDA content and ROS accumulation and elevated SOD activity and GSH content). ALB, APOE, GPX3, and SOD3 expressions were elevated by NAC in the CNS of EAE mice. Moreover, NAC reduced tissue-resident CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and GFAP-marked astrocytes and Iba-1-marked microglia in EAE mice, thus alleviating autoimmunity-mediated damage and neuroinflammation. Our findings facilitate the discovery of novel oxidative stress-related biomarkers for AE and reveal the promise of anti-oxidative stress for AE management.

        <tr id="Background HIV-1-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-1-NCI) is marked by ongoing and chronic neuroinflammation with loss and decline in neuronal function even when antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) successfully suppresses viral replication. Microglia, the primary reservoirs of HIV-1 in the central nervous system (CNS), play a significant role in maintaining this neuroinflammatory state. However, understanding how chronic neuroinflammation is generated and sustained by HIV-1, or impacted by ART, is difficult due to limited access to human CNS tissue. Methods We generated an in vitro model of admixed hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) derived microglia embedded into embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived Brain Organoids (BO). Microglia were infected with HIV-1 prior to co-culture. Infected microglia were co-cultured with brain organoids BOs to infiltrate the BOs and establish a model for HIV-1 infection, “HIV-1 M-BO”. HIV-1 M-BOs were treated with ART for variable directions. HIV-1 infection was monitored with p24 ELISA and by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Inflammation was measured by cytokine or p-NF-kB levels using multiplex ELISA, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results HIV-1 infected microglia could be co-cultured with BOs to create a model for “brain” HIV-1 infection. Although HIV-1 infected microglia were the initial source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, astrocytes, neurons and neural stem cells also had increased p-NF-kB levels, along with elevated CCL2 levels in the supernatant of HIV-1 M-BOs compared to Uninfected M-BOs. ART suppressed the virus to levels below the limit of detection but did not decrease neuroinflammation. Conclusions These findings indicate that HIV-1 infected microglia are pro-inflammatory. Although ART significantly suppressed HIV-1 levels, neuronal inflammation persisted in ART-treated HIV-1 M-BOs. Together, these findings indicate that HIV-1 infection of microglia infiltrated into BOs provides a robust in vitro model to understand the impact of HIV-1 and ART on neuroinflammation.

This study investigates the long-term immunological and neurodegenerative effects associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) in COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.13 Controls and 20 COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, were recruited. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in both plasma and EVs. A deep-immunophenotyping of monocytes, T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) was performed, along with immunostainings of SARS-CoV-2 in the colon.Higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurofilaments were found in EVs but not in plasma from COVID-19 survivors. Additionally, COVID-19 participants exhibited altered monocyte activation markers and elevated cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Increased activation markers in CD4+ T-cells and decreased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in DCs were observed in COVID-19 participants. Furthermore, the amount of plasmacytoid DCs9 expressing β7-integrin were higher in COVID-19, potentially associated with the viral persistence observed in the colon.COVID-19 survivors exhibit long-term immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring of PASC. The cargo of EVs can be a promising tool for early detection of virus-induced neurological disorders.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chikungunya (CHIKV) and dengue (DENV) are mosquito-borne viruses that cause severe epidemics, often in remote regions. A limitation to our understanding of these pathogens is the difficulty of performing assays of the cellular immune response. To fill this gap, we developed a novel miniaturized automated system capable of processing 250 μl of whole blood for high-throughput cellular analysis. In a field study with a pediatric cohort in Msambweni, Kenya, known for previous exposure to CHIKV and/or DENV, we processed 133 whole blood samples using our system under three conditions: no stimulation, and stimulation with CHIKV or DENV peptide pools. These samples underwent CyTOF or flow cytometry analysis to evaluate virus-specific memory T cell responses and phenotypes. CyTOF analysis of 81 participant samples revealed significant cytokine responses to CHIKV and DENV, particularly IFNγ (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and TNF-α (P < 0.0001) by γδ T cells. Additionally, a significant TNF-α response was observed in the CD8+ TEMRA memory subset to DENV, albeit to a lesser degree than in γδ T cells. To confirm our CyTOF findings, we employed flow cytometry on the remaining 40 samples using a targeted panel, validating significant TNF-α (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01) and IFN-γ (P < 0.05) responses by γδ T cells to CHIKV and DENV, respectively. Our study demonstrates that our innovative automated system enables detailed assessment of immune function, particularly beneficial in pediatric populations and resource-limited settings with limited sample volumes. This approach holds promise for advancing our understanding of cellular immune responses to various viral and infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life [1]. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells, and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV infected and bystander activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing. Importance Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and functional genomics to understand the host response in both RSV infected and bystander cells, identify what host factors mediate infection, and contextualize these findings relative to dozens of previously reported screens across 17 additional viruses.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 is rare in children suggesting differences in immune response between children and adults. Limited information is available on how cellular immunity is modulated by COVID-19 vaccination and prior infection, and whether it is differentially modulated in children compared to adults. Here, we aimed to compare COVID-19 vaccine-induced functional T cell response between adults and children with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adults (18–45 years; n = 45) and children (5–10 years; n = 51;), who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or remained unvaccinated, and previously infected or not with SARS-CoV-2 were selected from two cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies conducted in Bangladesh. Plasma nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibodies were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay; IFN-γ, perforin and granzyme B secreting T cells were assessed using ELISpot assay. Vaccination in adults without previous infection, induced higher frequencies of IFN-γ and granzyme B secreting T lymphocytes compared to unvaccinated adults, while it increased only IFN-γ expression in vaccinated children. Previous infection increased IFN-γ response in unvaccinated adults only. Unvaccinated children showed higher granzyme B expression compared to adults irrespective of infection status. In vaccinated individuals, prior infection induced perforin expression in both adults and children. Children showed slightly different functional T cell response than adults in response to COVID-19 vaccination and infection. mRNA vaccination provided higher IFN-γ response in both adults and children, but induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in adults only. Future studies may evaluate the impact of other types of COVID-19 vaccines on functional T cell immunity in children to confirm the findings.

        <tr id="Background The mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after non-severe COVID-19 remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood cells of patients with post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) and assess if distinct clinical subtypes with specific gene signatures could be identified. Methods The cohort included 111 PCC patients from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant era, with 57 recovered (Recov) and 54 having prolonged symptoms indicative of PCC. The results were compared to 63 healthy controls (Ctrl) without known SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data included patient assessments, laboratory results, comorbidities, and questionnaires on quality of life and functioning. Transcriptomic analysis and cellular deconvolution methods were used on total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results PCC patients had more comorbidities (mean 1.3) and more frequently (59%) at least one comorbidity than recovered patients (31%) and controls (24%). Overall, past COVID-19 illness or current PCC symptoms caused minimal changes in the blood cell transcriptome, with only 3–6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified across comparisons. However, a subset of male PCC patients exhibited an increased fraction of deconvoluted erythroblasts and significant genome-wide gene expression changes, with 399 DEGs compared to recovered and control males. These genes were enriched in pathways related to heme metabolism and gas exchange in erythrocytes. Conclusions Persistent symptoms in PCC are multifactorial and not directly linked to peripheral blood cell gene expression changes. However, a subgroup of male PCC patients shows distinct erythrocyte responses that may contribute to long-term symptoms.">

        <tr id="Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a pathogen that is capable of colonizing various infection sites and can potentially elicit an inadequate immune response that will lead to sepsis. The processes underlying this misdirected immune reaction remain poorly understood, and reliable biomarkers for indicating impending organ failure during sepsis are still missing. The present study aims to identify parameters that can predict the onset of end-organ damage in the course of sepsis. To that extent, we investigated key aspects of the immune response in early-phase sepsis following infection of different tissues in a mouse model, using Brefeldin A to link cytokine production to specific cell types through multi-parameter flow cytometry. Subcutaneous and intravenous GAS infections resulted in clinical sepsis, which was paralleled by peripheral blood lymphopenia. Intravenous infection in particular was associated with a higher bacterial burden in the liver that strongly correlated with an increased granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio of the peripheral blood. Strikingly, IL-6 overexpression was more pronounced in intravenous infection and strongly correlated with hepatic stress, indicated by elevated bacterial loads in the liver. Collectively, our data highlight the potential utility of IL-6 in conjunction with an elevated granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio as promising early indicators of concomitant liver stress in sepsis.

        <tr id="Introduction Hematogenous disseminated tuberculosis (DTB) has an unclear etiology that likely involves multiple factors. Understanding the underlying immunological characteristics of DTB is crucial for elucidating its pathogenesis. Methods We conducted single-cell RNA transcriptome and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on samples from seven DTB patients. Additionally, we integrated and analyzed data from two published profiles of latent TB infection, three active TB cases, and two healthy controls. Results Our analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of inflammatory immune cells (e.g., monocytes and macrophages) in DTB patients, along with a notably lower abundance of various lymphocytes (including T cells, B cells, and plasma cells), suggesting that lymphopenia is a prominent feature of the disease. T cell pseudotime analysis indicated a decrease in the expression of most hypervariable genes over time, pointing to T cell functional exhaustion. Furthermore, a marked absence of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells was observed in the peripheral blood of DTB patients. In the TCR repertoire, specific polymorphisms (TRAV9-2, TRAV13-1, TRBV20-1, and TRBV5-1) and dominant clones (TRAJ49, TRBJ2-7, and TRBJ2-1) were identified. Analysis of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) showed that the most frequent combination was TRAV1-2/TRAJ33, with the motif “CAAMD” being significantly reduced in DTB patients. Discussion These findings suggest that lymphopenia and T cell exhaustion, along with unique TCR signatures, may play critical roles in DTB pathogenesis. The reduced “CAAMD” motif and altered TCR clonotypes provide novel insights into the complex cellular dynamics associated with the disease, potentially offering new avenues for targeted immunological interventions.">

        <tr id="Background Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome predominantly affecting children, with a propensity to induce coronary artery lesions. Aberrant immune activation and cytokines cascade reactions are involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in immune cell communication during the course of KD and to identify potential biomarkers. Methods The study enrolled seven pediatric patients diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease (KD) between December 2019 and December 2021. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was utilized to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Bioinformatics methods including quality control, dimensionality reduction, cell annotation, differential expression analysis, cell communication analysis, and co-expression network analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. Results This study utilized single-cell sequencing technology to uncover the dynamics of immune cell communication during the course of KD, revealing a significant increase in the number of CD14+ monocytes in the early stages of vasculitis, which play a central role in cell-cell communication. SELPLG was identified as a particularly crucial gene in the signal transduction among immune cells. The study also observed various cellular communication patterns of vasculitis at different time points and identified co-expression modules related to ribosomal function, cell proliferation, and immune responses in CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD16+ monocytes. Notably, the expression of the ITK gene in CD14+ monocytes stood out. Furthermore, MHC-I genes were the most active molecules involved in signal transduction, and the expression of CD40 genes increased with the prolongation of vasculitis duration. Conclusion CD14+ monocytes play a pivotal role in cellular communication during the activation process of KD vasculitis, with SELPLG and ITK as important communication signal genes. These findings provide a novel perspective for the discovery of biomarkers, prediction of disease progression, and the development of targeted treatment strategies for KD.

        <tr id="Background The T cell compartment undergoes significant age-related changes, contributing to the decline of the adaptive immune system and increasing the risk of suboptimal antibody responses to vaccines in older adults. To better understand the association between T cell phenotypes and vaccine responsiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of CD4+, CD8+, and γδ + T cells on VITAL cohort participants who are low or high responders to multiple vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and SARS-CoV-2). Results Using spectral cytometry and FlowSOM, we identified detailed phenotypes of naïve, regulatory, and terminally differentiated T cells. We observed that the percentages of CD31 + naïve CD4+, CD31 + naïve CD8+, and CD38 + naïve CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in low vaccine responders. Notably, CD31 + naïve T cell subsets showed a stronger correlation with immune entropy, a measure of cumulative immune system perturbations, than with age itself. Conclusions These findings suggest that subsets of naïve cells could be associated with weak vaccine responsiveness and immunosenescence. Furthermore, these naive T cell signatures could help predict weak vaccine responses, potentially informing targeted vaccination strategies in older adults.

        <tr id="Abstract Dysregulated innate immune responses contribute to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), characterized by gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous, and/or cardiovascular injury occurring weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. To investigate innate immune functions, we stimulated ex vivo peripheral blood cells from MIS-C patients with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR), key innate immune response initiators. We found severely dampened cytokine responses and elevated gene expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling. Increased plasma levels of zonulin, a gut leakage marker, were also detected. These effects were also observed in fully convalescent children months after MIS-C recovery. When we investigated the genetic background of patients in relation to TLR responsiveness, we found that cells from MIS-C children carrying rare heterozygous variants of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) were less refractory to TLR stimulation and exhibited lysosomal and mitochondrial abnormalities with altered energy metabolism. Moreover, these rare LYST variant heterozygous carriers tended to exhibit unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation, including more profound lymphopenia. The results of our observational study have several implications. First, TLR hyporesponsiveness may be associated with hyperinflammation and/or excessive or prolonged stimulation with gut-originated TLR ligands. Second, TLR hyporesponsiveness during MIS-C may be protective, since LYST variant heterozygous carriers exhibited reduced TLR hyporesponsiveness and unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation. Thus, links may exist between genetic background, ability to establish a refractory immune state, and MIS-C clinical spectrum. Third, the possibility exists that prolonged TLR hyporesponsiveness is one of the mechanisms driving long coronavirus disease (COVID), which highlights the need to monitor long-term consequences of MIS-C.">

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron has demonstrated decreased pathogenicity, yet a few individuals suffer severe pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection; the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Methods The present work investigated the role of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the occurrence and progression of severe Omicron infection. The expression and dynamic changes of ISGs were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the anti-ISG15 autoantibody in infected patients was detected by ELISA. Moreover, we evaluated the correlation of ISGs with disease severity and outcomes by comparing expression of ISGs among each group. Results Decreased expression of several ISGs such as IFI6 are potentially linked to increased severity or poor outcomes of Omicron infection. Longitudinal data also demonstrates that the dynamic variation of IFI6 in the Omicron infection phase may be linked to the prognosis of the disease. The increase of anti-ISG15 autoantibody potentially links to the disease progression and poor outcome of patients with high level of ISG15 expression. Conclusions These findings define aberrant Interferon-stimulated gene associated host responses and reveal potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets for Omicron or other viral infection.">

Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.">

        <tr id="Microglia continuously monitor neuronal health through somatic purinergic junctions, where microglial processes establish dynamic contacts with neuronal cell bodies. The P2Y12 receptor is a key component of these junctions, essential for intercellular communication between ramified microglia and neurons under homeostatic conditions. While P2Y12 has long been considered a marker of homeostatic microglia, its potential role in reactive microglia during neurodegenerative disease remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that P2Y12 deletion significantly reduces microglia-neuron process-to-body contacts in adult mice, consistent with previous findings. However, unexpectedly, P2Y12 loss markedly increases microglia-neuron body-to-body contacts, revealing an alternative mode of microglia-neuron communication independent of P2Y12. In prion-infected mice, P2Y12 expression persists in reactive, amoeboid microglia during advanced disease stages, including those engaging in extensive neuronal envelopment. Notably, P2Y12 loss increases the prevalence of envelopment events and accelerates disease progression. These findings redefine the role of P2Y12 in neurodegeneration, suggesting that its progressive decline lowers the threshold for microglia-neuron body-to-body interactions, ultimately influencing disease trajectory.">

        <tr id="The upper airway epithelium is the primary site of exposure to Bordetella pertussis and the initiator of host responses to this microbe. B. pertussis may cause serious respiratory infections resulting in major complications, as well as severe impairment of airway function. While pertussis treatment options are limited because the molecular responses in the upper respiratory tract in the early stages of infection have not been characterized. Here, we performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of nasal turbinates isolated from mice over 11 days after B. pertussis infection. Using RNA-seq, we characterized the differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with the changes in the nasal turbinates following infection. Statistical analysis revealed that infection is a dynamic process characterized by increased expression of a set of acute inflammatory responses at an early stage. After this initial inflammatory response, we observed increases in the levels of transcripts associated with the regulation of immune processes. In particular, we found that B. pertussis infection significantly increased the levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and related genes in the nasal turbinates at 2 h, 2 days, and 4 days postinfection. Therefore, we investigated the role of type I IFNs in B. pertussis infection in type I IFNs receptor-deficient (IFNAR1−/−) mice. There was no difference in bacterial clearance or adaptive immune responses between wild-type and IFNAR1−/− mice. However, a lack of type I IFNs signaling ameliorated pulmonary immunopathology, reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and limited the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung during B. pertussis infection. Thus, our findings suggest that inhibiting the effects of type I IFNs may contribute to dampening inflammation, which could be an approach for the treatment of B. pertussis infection and management of the associated disease symptoms.">

In this study, we evaluated whether Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), a serum marker of lung alveolar cell damage, is predictive for disease severity. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. Serum levels of Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), soluble Fas Ligand, cytochrome C, thymus- and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) and of oxidate stress related proteins were analyzed. Clinical patient data were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database. COVID-19 positive patients were divided in two groups according to disease severity. The mean day difference between COVID-19 diagnosis date and sampling date was +11 days. Concentrations of TARC were lower in COVID-19 positive versus COVID-19 negative patients (unpaired t-test, p=0.002). In addition, CC16 serum levels were significantly elevated in sera taken from patients that were admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) (p=0.0082). In a matched cohort, sera taken prior to ICU admission (-3 days) contained higher CC16 levels (paired t-test, p=0.0072). Multivariable analyses adjusted for known risk factors (age, gender, blood counts, lactate dehydrogenase, c-reactive protein, underlying disease) showed that CC16 levels were independently associated to COVID-19 severity (interquartile-range, odds ratio 1.53, p=0.0102). In conclusion, our findings highlight CC16 as a promising biomarker for early identification of severe COVID19 cases, which could improve patient management and resource allocation.">

        <tr id="Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs’ functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, FCGRT gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of FCGRT showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, TRIM21 transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in TRIM21 transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors DDX58 and IFIH1, the transcriptional level of inflammatory IL1B and IL18 was generally very low, along with the NLRP3 danger sensor, members of the NF-κB pathway, and TNF. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.">

Moreover, we hypothesize that epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) targeting the epipharynx could improve long COVID symptoms by modulating local inflammation and gene expression. We conducted a comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles of three patients with long COVID and two control individuals without COVID-19. Residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the epipharynx of patients with long COVID, along with the activation of signalling pathways in epithelial and immune cells. After EAT, the viral RNA was either completely cleared or significantly reduced. T-cell receptor signalling pathways were suppressed; the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α, were reduced; and excessive antibody production was mitigated. Histology showed that EAT effectively eliminated the inflamed, dysfunctional ciliated epithelium. This study clarifies that SARS-CoV-2 has long-term effects on the immune response in the epipharynx, emphasizing the need to focus on chronic epipharyngitis as a potential cause of long COVID. Furthermore, EAT may offer a promising approach to alleviating persistent long COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="Preterm sepsis is a major contributor to brain injury and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, but its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study integrated clinical and experimental approaches to investigate the pathological changes linking systemic inflammation to brain injury in preterm infants. Transcriptomic analysis of septic preterm infants’ peripheral blood revealed upregulated immune, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways, suggesting a link between systemic and brain inflammation. Using P2 mice, we established a preterm white matter injury model through multiple doses of lipopolysaccharide, observing dose-dependent developmental delays, brain inflammation, and long-term behavioral deficits. Integrative analyses of peripheral blood and brain samples from both mice and preterm infants revealed consistent chemokine alterations and immune cell infiltration across peripheral and central compartments, highlighting the significant involvement of neutrophil extracellular traps in preterm brain injury. Furthermore, microglia exhibited significant transcriptional changes during the acute phase, accompanied by metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, with suggested involvement of Pgk1 and Pgam1. This shift intensified with escalating inflammation, along with PANoptosis-related gene upregulation, ultimately associated with microglial cell death. Collectively, these findings provide pathological insights into the immunometabolic alterations underlying sepsis-induced preterm brain injury and suggest potential targets for future therapeutic interventions to mitigate long-term neurodevelopmental deficits.

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 infection results in greater disease severity among immunocompromised individuals compared to healthy individuals. However, there is conflicting information about the impact of chronic HIV infection on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Method We used a combination of machine learning approaches and network analysis to explore 56 immune markers and comprehensively profile humoral and cellular immunity in a cross-sectional observational cohort of people without HIV (PWOH; n = 216) and people living with HIV (PLWH; n = 43) who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (13–131 days since SARS-COV-2 diagnosis) early in the pandemic. Results PLWH recovered from symptomatic outpatient COVID-19 exhibit lower humoral and B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vs. PWOH but, surprisingly, both symptomatic outpatient and hospitalized PLWH have higher anti-endemic coronavirus antibody responses compared to PWOH counterparts and asymptomatic PLWH. The latter observation suggests that this was not strictly due to broadly elevated levels of anti-endemic coronavirus antibodies in PLWH. Moreover, correlation-based analysis reveals that while different compartments of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are positively correlated in PWOH recovered from symptomatic outpatient COVID-19, these correlations are weaker in PLWH. Conclusion Our analyses reveal significant differences in the coordinated immune responses elicited by infection in PLWH compared to PWOH.">

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection leads to viral encephalitis and neurological damage in mice, causing significant neurological symptoms and brain damage. This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms of PRV-induced encephalopathy and the role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We found that PRV infection increased the number of astrocytes and induced a phenotypic shift from the A2 to the A1 subtype, which was associated with increased secretion of MMP-9. MMP-9 was identified as a critical mediator of PRV-induced BBB disruption, as it degrades collagen VI, leading to BBB damage. PRV was shown to penetrate the BBB via a paracellular pathway, and MMP-9 deletion reversed this damage, mitigating tight junction injury. Additionally, PRV infection caused an “inflammatory storm” in the central nervous system (CNS), with increased levels of the chemokines CCL-3, CCL-4, and CCL-5; the cytokines IL-6 and IL-18; and TNF-α. The expression of INF-γ was significantly decreased. In conclusion, PRV infection disrupts the BBB and induces an inflammatory response in the CNS, with MMP-9 playing a key role in mediating BBB damage. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of PRV-induced encephalopathy and potential therapeutic targets for viral encephalitis.">

        <tr id="Background The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease characterized by leukocyte infiltration in the spinal cord. T-lymphocytes are the most important targets of HTLV-1 infection, but monocytes are also infected. Monocytes from HTLV-1-infected individuals exhibit important functional differences compared to cells from uninfected donors. Here, we investigated the effects of cell-cell physical contact and/or secreted factors of HTLV-1-infected cells in monocyte activation and differentiation. Methods The THP-1 human monocytic cell line was co-cultured with a human cell line transformed by HTLV-1 (MT-2) for 6 days. To determine the effects of co-culturing HTLV-1-infected cells in THP-1 monocytes cells were characterized by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and real-time PCR. Computational analysis of published transcriptomic datasets was realized to compare molecular profiles of macrophages and mononuclear cells from HTLV-1 carriers. Results Co-culture of monocytes with HTLV-1-infected cells induced macrophage differentiation and upregulation of typical macrophages-associated molecules (HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86), increased cytokine (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β) levels and their coding genes expression. Consistently, published transcriptomic datasets showed changes in important genes associated with inflammation during HAM/TSP in patients. The presence of HTLV-1-infected cells in the culture also induced significant upregulation of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISG), indicating viral infection. Monocyte activation and differentiation into pro-inflammatory macrophages occurred in a cell-to-cell contact-independent manner, suggesting the role of factors secreted by infected cells. Conclusions Together, our results indicated that HTLV-1-infected cells induced monocyte differentiation into macrophages inflammatory, predominantly.

        <tr id="Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids and immune cells in the arterial wall, leading to the narrowing and stiffening of blood vessels. The involvement of both innate and adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of human atherosclerosis is increasingly recognised. However, the spatial organization and specific roles of immune cells during the various stages of disease progression remain poorly understood, underscoring the necessity for additional research to elucidate their functions throughout the disease course. A better understanding of the immune response’s contribution to atherosclerosis progression could unveil novel therapeutic targets to mitigate plaque development and rupture, ultimately reducing the burden of cardiovascular events. In this study, we utilised NanoString GeoMx® and CosMx™ technologies to analyse serial sections of human coronary arteries from patients with varying degrees of atherosclerotic lesion severity. Our work consists of a series of investigations, and integrated findings from both the GeoMx® and CosMx™ datasets, including pathway analyses, cell typing, and neighbourhood analysis. This workflow underscores the power of combining these spatial transcriptomics platforms to elucidate biological processes at the single-cell level, hence unbiasedly providing molecules and pathways of relevance to aid in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and assessing the opportunity of novel therapies.">

        <tr id="A proviral reservoir persists within the central nervous system (CNS) of people with HIV, but its characteristics remain poorly understood. Research has primarily focused on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as acquiring brain tissue is challenging. We examined size, cellular tropism, and infection-dynamics of the viral reservoir in post-mortem brain tissue from five individuals on and off antiretroviral therapy (ART) across three brain regions. Microglia-enriched fractions (CD11b+) were isolated and levels of intact proviral DNA were quantified (IPDA). Full-length envelope reporter viruses were generated and characterized in CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived microglia. HIV DNA was observed in microglia-enriched fractions of all individuals, but intact proviruses were identified only in one ART-treated individual, representing 15% of the total proviruses. Phenotypic analyses of clones from this individual showed that 80% replicated efficiently in microglia and CD4+ T cells, while the remaining viruses replicated only in CD4+ T cells. No region-specific effects were observed. These results indicate a distinct HIV brain reservoir in microglia for all individuals, although intact proviruses were detected in only one. Given the unique immune environment of the CNS, the characteristics of microglia, and the challenges associated with targeting these cells, the CNS reservoir should be considered in cure strategies.">

        <tr id="The implementation of COVID-19 policy and the rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the early pandemic significantly contained numerous outbreaks and reduced the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, the population immunity induced by existing vaccines was insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The host immunity induced by the wide spread of Omicron variants and its influence on emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are attracting broad attention. In this study, a clinical data analysis of the patients indicated that pre-vaccination reduced inflammatory responses and mitigated the severity of COVID-19 cases caused by natural infection with Omicron BA.5.2. The analysis of adaptive immune responses indicated that natural infection with BA.5.2 induced robust and broad immune responses, including both humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses (IFN-γ) against highly conserved viral antigens, and provided cross-reactive neutralization against various viral variants. Collectively, we report that the natural infection with Omicron BA.5.2 induced broad cross-reactive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, which suggests that the development of a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with desired safety, high efficacy, broad spectrum, and long-term immune persistence is feasible. Therefore, we suggest that herd immunity, achieved through vaccination with attenuated vaccines, combined with booster doses of existing vaccines and antiviral therapy for people with high viral loads, may contribute to the eradication of this virus.">

We found that mice deficient in platelets’ 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) demonstrate exacerbated inflammation and worse outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. One mediator derived from platelet 12-LOX activity, 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), was found to negatively correlate with disease severity. Taken together our data unravel a possible role of platelets and possibly 12-HETrE, which is documented as promoting anti-inflammatory effects, in dampening the inflammatory burden of infected mice and pinpoints potential new therapeutic strategies (12-LOX inhibitors or 12-HETrE receptor agonists) to better combat severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Although the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the emergence of the post-COVID-19 condition presents a new and complex public health challenge, characterized by persistent, multisystem symptoms that can endure for weeks or months after the initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, significantly affecting survivors’ quality of life. Among the most concerning sequelae are cardiovascular complications, which encompass a broad spectrum of conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial damage, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This narrative review explores the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular health by reviewing the latest and most relevant findings in the literature and highlighting different aspects of COVID-19’s cardiovascular involvement. This review investigates the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular involvement in the post-COVID-19 condition, with a focus on direct viral invasion via ACE2 receptors, immune-mediated cardiovascular injury, cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and mitochondrial injury. The interplay between pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, and COVID-19 is also explored, revealing that individuals with such conditions are at heightened risk for both severe acute illness and long-term complications. Long-term immune activation and the persistence of viral antigens are increasingly recognized as contributors to ongoing cardiovascular damage, even in individuals with mild or asymptomatic initial infections. As the healthcare system continues to adapt to the long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a deeper understanding of these cardiovascular manifestations is essential. This knowledge will inform the development of targeted strategies for prevention, clinical management, and rehabilitation of affected patients. Furthermore, the insights gained from the intersection of COVID-19 and cardiovascular health will be instrumental in shaping responses to future viral epidemics, highlighting the necessity for multidisciplinary approaches to patient care and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="Background Neuroinflammation is a prominent pathological hallmark of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and glia cells have been widely characterized in the onset or progression of brain inflammation. While an effect of inflammation on cerebrovascular breakdown has been observed, little is known about the specific contribution of brain pericytes to the inflammatory response in TBI. Here, we focused on studying the pericyte response to inflammatory stimuli commonly found in the brain following TBI. Methods Mouse brain vascular pericytes were exposed to IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ for 2 h and 24 h and probed for markers of pericyte health and a panel of inflammatory mediators. As the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathway is critical to pericyte function, we also assessed the effect of PDGF-BB stimulation on the inflammatory response in pericytes. Cultured pericytes were treated with PDGF-BB (10 ng/mL) prior to, simultaneously, and following inflammatory insult. To further investigate their role in brain immunosurveillance, we analyzed the cytokine secretome in mouse pericyte cultures treated with PDGF-BB, as well as in brain vascular pericytes isolated from repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI) mice that were fed phenytoin-enriched chow, an inducer of PDGF-BB secretion. Results Cytokine stimulation with TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ for 2 and 24 h led to significant upregulation of PDGFRβ in cultured pericytes, with an 8-fold increase after 24 h. MTT assays showed no significant change in cell viability, indicating that cytokine treatment did not induce cytotoxicity. Further, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers STAT1 and p-NFkB were observed in response to cytokine exposure, with a concurrent increase in VCAM1 and MMP9 expression. PDGF-BB treatment significantly attenuated the inflammatory response in pericytes, reducing PDGFRβ levels and the activation of inflammatory pathways, including STAT1 and NFkB. Cytokine secretion profiles also revealed that PDGF-BB, when administered post-inflammatory insult, selectively reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IFN-γ. Additionally, phenytoin treatment in r-mTBI mice decreased IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-5, and KC/GRO levels in isolated brain pericytes, while IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 levels were unchanged compared to untreated r-mTBI animals. Conclusions Our results indicate an immunoreactive role for brain pericytes in the propagation of neuroinflammation. Moreover, following brain insults, we found PDGF-BB stimulation can normalize pericyte function and reduce cerebrovascular inflammation, a key factor in secondary brain injury. Targeting brain pericytes may provide novel therapeutic opportunities to improve cerebrovascular health and reduce brain inflammation in the aftermath of TBI.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID‐19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS‐CoV‐2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID‐19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high‐throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID‐19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID‐19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background Monocytes represent a vital cellular subpopulation in the peripheral blood, crucial in the progression of sepsis. Nonetheless, the prognostic role and precise function of monocytes in sepsis are still inadequately understood. Methods Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed on peripheral blood samples from septic patients to identify key molecules in cell subsets. Subsequently, the expression pattern of this molecule was validated through diverse biological experiments, encompassing quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Finally, the functionality of this molecule was evaluated using its specific agonist. Results A total of 22 monocytes-related biomarkers were identified from single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses. Initially, LASSO analysis was performed to derive a prognostic signature composed of 4 key genes, including CD14, CTSS, CXCL8 and THBS1. Subsequently, mendelian randomization and survival analysis demonstrated that only CTSS showed crucially protective role in sepsis development and prognosis. Next, CTSS was confirmed to be lower expressed in peripheral monocytes of septic patients. Inflammatory markers (p < 0.05) and migration ability of LPS-activated monocytes were significantly reduced after CTSS agonist. In addition, CTSS agonist decreased the pulmonary tissue monocyte/macrophages infiltration in septic mice. Conclusion Monocyte marker CTSS represent a promising target for the diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of sepsis and plays a critical role in monocytes activation, tissue inflammatory response and macrophages infiltration. Thus, CTSS agonist probably serves as new drug for clinical protection against sepsis.">

        <tr id="Post-infection sequela of several viruses have been linked with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we investigated whether mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone or in combination with two putative Parkinsonian toxins, MPTP and paraquat, increased the susceptibility to develop Parkinsonian pathology. We also examined if G2019S LRRK2 mice had any change in sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 as well as if vaccination against this virus altered any neuropathology. Infection with WA-1/2020 or Omicron B1.1.529 strains sensitized both WT and G2019S LRRK2 mice to the neuropathological effects of a subtoxic exposure to MPTP, but not paraquat. These neuropathologies were rescued in WT mice vaccinated with mRNA- or protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice were only protected with the protein-based vaccine. These results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of Parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are a granulocytic population of myeloid cells that have critical effector functions during infectious disease but are generally thought to be short-lived and nonproliferative with markedly limited activation states. In these studies, we directly compared lung neutrophil activation following infection with different groups of pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and helminths. Our results demonstrate considerable heterogeneity depending on the type of infectious agent. In contrast to bacterial and fungal infection, after helminth infection neutrophils expressed markers associated with characteristic type 2 responses and unexpectedly upregulated genes associated with cell cycling and protein synthesis. Further studies showed reduced neutrophil cell death following helminth infection and increased proliferation, which was dependent on IL-4R signaling. This distinct subset of proliferating neutrophils expanded following helminth infection and was released from the endothelial niche to colocalize with invading parasites in the airways. These studies demonstrate a novel long-lived cycling phenotype for neutrophils following helminth infection.">

        <tr id="Microglia and astrocytes are the primary glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and their function is shaped by multiple factors. Regulation of CNS glia by the microbiota have been reported, although the role of specific bacteria has not been identified. We colonized germ-free mice with the type strain Akkermansia muciniphila (AmT) and a novel A. muciniphila strain BWH-H3 (Am-H3) isolated from a subject with multiple sclerosis and compared to mice colonized with Bacteroides cellulosilyticus strain BWH-E5 (Bc) isolated from a healthy control subject. We then investigated the effect of these bacteria on microglia and astrocyte gene expression by RNA sequencing. We found altered gene expression profiles in brain microglia, with Akkermansia downregulating genes related to antigen presentation and cell migration. Furthermore, we observed strain specific effects, with Akkermansia H3 upregulating histone and protein binding associated genes and downregulating channel and ion transport genes. Astrocyte pathways that were altered by Akkermansia H3 mono-colonization included upregulation of proliferation pathways and downregulation in cytoskeletal associated genes. Furthermore, animals colonized with type strain Akkermansia and strain H3 had effects on the immune system including elevated splenic γδ-T cells and increased IFNγ production in CD4 + T cells. We also measured intestinal short chain fatty acids and found that both A. muciniphila strains produced proprionate while B. cellulosilyticus produced acetate, proprionate, and isovalerate. Taken together, our study shows that specific members of the intestinal microbiota influence both microglial and astroyctes which may be mediated by changes in short chain fatty acids and peripheral immune signaling.

        <tr id="Background COVID-19 appears to have a progression of three stages. The latter stage is characterized by a high level of cytokine release, which in turn triggers an uncontrolled reaction known as cytokine storm where mast cells are involved. The presence of anti-IgE antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in this phase has been previously reported, suggesting an association with the severity of the disease. Our study aims to assess the prognostic significance of IgE antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 across a spectrum of clinical presentations, including individual with mild symptoms, hospitalized patients, and those who presented a critical progression. Methods The study included 64 patients distributed into the following groups: 22 critically ill hospitalized individuals (Critical); 21 non-critical hospitalized patients (Severe); 21 mild symptomatic non-hospitalized cases (Mild); and 22 healthy blood donors with samples collected in October 2019. Anti-IgE antibodies against Spike (S) protein were detected using a homemade ELISA, where the plate was sensitized with the RBD of recombinant S protein. Results Among 64 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 28.1% tested positive for IgE isotype antibodies against S protein RBD, whose prevalence was similar across severity groups: Mild 23.8%, Severe 28.6%, and Critical 31.8% (p = 0.842). Patients with IgE response exhibited higher levels of LDH compared to non-IgE responders, with a 40% increase (p = 0.037), and a non-significantly higher tendency in other inflammatory markers. Conclusion In SARS-CoV-2 infection, roughly a fourth of patients presented an IgE isotype response, regardless of disease severity, which is associated with higher levels of LDH.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND Safe and effective vaccines are a key preventative measure to protect infants from SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. Although mRNA vaccines induce robust antibody titers in infants, little is known about the quality of CD4 T-cell responses induced by vaccination. CD4 T-cell responses are important in orchestrating coordinated immune responses during infection and may help to limit disease severity. METHODS: To characterize the CD4 T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in infants, we sampled blood from 13 infants before and after primary SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine series; samples from 12 historical vaccinated adults were used for comparisons. PBMC were stimulated with Spike peptide pools and the ability of CD4 T-cells to secrete Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines was quantified. A measure of polyfunctionality was generated using the COMPASS algorithm. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in CD4 T-cells producing IL-2 (0.01% vs. 0.08%, p=0.04) and TNF-α (0.007% vs. 0.07%, p=0.007) following vaccination in infants but a more muted induction of IFN-γ production (0.01% vs 0.04%, p=0.08). This contrasted with adults, in whom vaccination induced robust production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α. Th2 and Th17 responses were limited in both infants and adults. In infants, CD4 T-cell responses post-vaccination were greater in those who received mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b. In contrast to CD4 T-cell responses, Spike-specific IgG titers were similar in infants and adults. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that infants have restricted induction of cytokine producing CD4 T-cells following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination relative to adults.">

        <tr id="Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection associated intestinal manifestations including diarrhea and proctitis have been frequently reported during mpox outbreaks. The clade IIb MPXV strain has caused the 2022-2023 global outbreak, whereas the Ia and Ib strains are causing the concurrent outbreaks in Africa. Here, we found clinical evidence that MPXV can directly infect human intestine to induce lesions. Intriguingly, primary organoids cultured from human ileum and rectum support productive infections of MPXV clade IIb, Ia and Ib strains. Upon differentiation, we found that enterocytes and goblet cells but not enteroendocrine cells are capable of supporting viral replication. Given that primary intestinal organoids can be rapidly expanded in large scale, we were able to screen a broad-spectrum antiviral drug library. We identified 12 leading candidates of safe-in-human agents including clinically used drugs such as clofarabine. We extensively validated the anti-MPXV activity of clofarabine in human intestinal and skin organoids, and consistently demonstrated the potent antiviral activity against clade Ia, Ib and IIb strains. These findings are important for better understanding the clinical manifestations of mpox. Primary intestinal organoids based infection models and the established antiviral drug discovery pipeline bear major implications in responding to the current mpox global health emergency, and sustaining epidemic poxvirus preparedness.">

        <tr id="Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), professional type I IFN–producing cells, have been implicated in host responses against bacterial infections. However, their role in host defense is debated, and the operating molecular mechanisms are unknown. Certain signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family (SLAMF) members act as microbial sensors and modulate immune functions in response to infection. Here, human blood transcriptomic analyses reveal the involvement of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in many infectious diseases, with elevated levels associated with type I IFN responses in salmonellosis and brucellosis patients. We further identify SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 as key regulators of human pDC function. They activate pDC maturation and cytokine production during infection with bacteria that induce acute (Salmonella) or chronic (Brucella) inflammation. SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 signal through NF-κB, IRF7, and STAT-1, and limit mitochondrial ROS accumulation upon Salmonella infection. Remarkably, this SLAMF7/8-dependent control of mitochondrial ROS levels favors bacterial persistence and NF-κB activation. Overall, our results unravel essential shared multifaceted roles of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in finely tuning human pDC responses to intracellular bacterial infections with potential for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications.">

        <tr id="Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a severe neurological syndrome marked by widespread brain dysfunctions due to sepsis. Despite increasing data supporting the hypothesis of neuronal damage, the exact mechanism of sepsis-related cognitive disorders and therapeutic strategies remain unclear and need further investigation. In this study, a sepsis model was established in C57 mice using lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The findings demonstrated that LPS exposure induced neuronal loss, synaptic and cognitive deficits accompanied by mitochondrial damage. Bioinformatics and western blot analyses demonstrated a significant increase in Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) during sepsis as a key hub gene involved in immune and neurological inflammation. Interestingly, the recombinant LCN2 protein exhibited similar effects on synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in C57 mice. Conversely, downregulating LCN2 effectively nullified the impact of LPS, leading to the amelioration of synaptic and cognitive deficits, neuronal loss, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated mitochondrial damage. These findings suggest a novel etiopathogenic mechanism of SAE, which is initiated by the increased LCN2, leading to neuronal loss and cognitive deficit. Inhibition of LCN2 could be therapeutically beneficial in treating sepsis-induced synaptic and cognitive impairments.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity provides the critical first line of defense against infection and sterile triggers. Cell death is a key component of the innate immune response to clear pathogens, but excessive or aberrant cell death can induce inflammation, cytokine storm, and pathology, making it a central molecular mechanism in inflammatory diseases. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one such inflammatory disease, but the specific innate immune mechanisms driving pathology in this context remain unclear. Here, by leveraging RNAseq and tissue expression in clinical samples, we identified increased expression of the innate immune sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) in patients with ALD. We discovered that ZBP1 expression correlated with ALD progression in patients, and that ethanol induced ZBP1-dependent lytic cell death, PANoptosis, in immune (macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells) and non-immune cells (hepatocytes). Mechanistically, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF9 and IRF1 upregulated ZBP1 expression, allowing ZBP1 to sense Z-NAs through its Zα2 domain and drive PANoptosis signaling, cell membrane rupture through NINJ1, and DAMP release. Furthermore, the expressions of ZBP1 and NINJ1 were upregulated in both liver and serum samples from patients with ALD. In mouse models of chronic and acute ALD, ZBP1-deficient mice were significantly protected from disease pathology and liver damage. Overall, our findings establish the critical role of the ZBP1-NINJ1 axis regulated by IRFs in driving inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in liver cells, suggesting that targeting these molecules will have therapeutic potential in ALD and other inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Monkeypox virus (Mpox) has been recognized for causing distinct skin lesions and is primarily transmitted through skin and sexual contact. To date, the transmissibility and pathogenesis of the Mpox virus in distal human lung has never been completely explored. Here the transmission pathways and Mpox tropism on patient-derived air-liquid epithelium (ALE) model fabricated using isolated primary human alveolar epithelial cells (hAECs) were investigated. hAECs were cultured and exposed to the Mpox virus clade IIb isolated from the patient. DNA, proteins, and the tropism were elucidated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, and high-content fluorescent imaging. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to systematically observe the cellular distribution of viral particles. Viral titres were determined by TCID50 assay. Innate immune response and inflammatory mediators were measured using Milliplex® multiplex and ELISA analysis. Pathology at alveolar barrier integrity was determined using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) analysis. The study included mock-infected cells as control. Mpox virus significantly infected 42.82% of total hAEC populations. The prominent observed pathology included a significant reduction in TEER values, loss of tight junction protein, presence of tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs), and syncytium morphology. Four stages of Mpox biogenesis were clearly observed without significant activation of IL-6, MIP1alpha, TNF-α, and Galectin-9, although IL-1β were subtly promoted. The developed patient-derived ALE is a versatile model for Mpox virus clade IIb infection reflecting respiratory transmission competence of the Mpox. Postinfection lung pathogenesis demonstrated alveolar barrier damage without significant inflammation, raising concerns about possible immune evasion by the virus.">

        <tr id="The nasopharynx and its microbiota are implicated in respiratory health and disease. The interplay between viral infection and the nasopharyngeal microbiome is an area of increased interest. The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, on the nasopharyngeal microbiome among individuals living with HIV is not fully characterized. Here, we describe the nasopharyngeal microbiome before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a longitudinal cohort of Kenyan women (21 living with HIV and 14 HIV-uninfected) and their children (18 HIV-exposed, uninfected and 7 HIV-unexposed, uninfected) between September 2021 and March 2022. We show using genomic epidemiology that mother and child dyads were infected with the same strain of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant that spread rapidly across Kenya. We used metagenomic sequencing to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiome of 20 women and children infected with SARS-CoV-2, six children negative for SARS-CoV-2 but experiencing respiratory symptoms, and 34 timepoint-matched SARS-CoV-2-negative mothers and children. Since individuals were sampled longitudinally before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we could characterize the short- (within a week of infection) and longer- (average of 38 days post-infection) term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the nasopharyngeal microbiome. We found that mothers and children had significantly different microbiome composition and bacterial load (P-values < 0.0001). In both mothers and children, the nasopharyngeal microbiome did not differ before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of HIV exposure status. Our results indicate that the nasopharyngeal microbiome is resilient to SARS-CoV-2 infection and was not significantly modified by HIV.


IMPORTANCE
The nasopharyngeal microbiome plays an important role in human health. The degree of impact that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has on the nasopharyngeal microbiome varies among studies and may be influenced by diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants and variations in the microbiome between individuals. Our results show that the nasopharyngeal microbiome was not altered substantially by SARS-CoV-2 infection nor by HIV infection in mothers or HIV exposure in children. Our findings highlight the resilience of the nasopharyngeal microbiome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings advance our understanding of the nasopharyngeal microbiome and its interactions with viral infections.">

        <tr id="Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) ligands effectively reduce immunopathological damage in viral pneumonia models. Specifically, S1P1 ligands inhibit cytokine storm and help preserve lung endothelial barrier integrity. We recently showed that the S1P receptor ligand ozanimod can be safely administered to hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibiting severe symptoms of viral pneumonia, with potential clinical benefits. Here, we extend on this study and investigate the impact of ozanimod on key features of the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. We quantified circulating cytokine levels, peripheral immune cell numbers, proportions and activation status; we also monitored the quality of the humoral response by assessing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) antibodies. Our findings reveal that patients receiving ozanimod during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significantly reduced numbers of circulating monocytes compared with those receiving standard care. Correspondingly, in the ozanimod-treated group, circulating levels of C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) were decreased. While treatment with ozanimod negatively impacted the humoral response to COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, it did not impair the development of a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in vaccinated patients. These findings suggest that ozanimod influences key immune mechanisms during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can provide information on patient immunity, identify asymptomatic patients, and track the spread of COVID-19. Efforts have been made to develop methods to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Here, we describe a flow cytometric assay for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in human plasma. To assess the antibody response against the different SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, five viral recombinant proteins, including spike protein subunit 1 (S1), N-terminal domain of S1 (S1A), spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein subunit 2 (S2), and nucleocapsid protein (N), were generated. A comparison of the antibody profiles detected by the assay with plasma from 100 healthy blood donors collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and plasma from 100 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated a clear discrimination between the two groups. Among the COVID-19 patients, the antibody responses for the viral proteins, as determined by their prevalence, were anti-RBD IgG = anti-N IgG > anti-S1 IgG > anti-S1A IgG > anti-S2 IgG, and anti-RBD IgM > anti-S1 IgM > anti-N IgM > anti-S2 IgM. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM was not associated with sex, age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness, except for a higher prevalence of anti-S2 IgG being observed in men than in women. The levels of anti-RBD IgG were higher in patients 65 years and older and in patients who had severe symptoms. Similarly, patients who had severe symptoms exhibited higher levels of anti-S1 and anti-S1A IgG than patients who had mild or moderate symptoms. The levels of anti-RBD IgM tended to be higher in men but did not differ among age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness. Our study indicates that the flow cytometric assay, especially using RBD as target antigen, can be used to detect simultaneously anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in human plasma.">

        <tr id="Background Cell-mediated immunity may provide durable protection against severe COVID-19, including among solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). This exploratory analysis in the open-label phase 3b trial evaluated cell-mediated immunity of mRNA-1273 in a subset of participants (59 kidney and 33 liver SOTRs; 12 immunocompetent participants). Methods In Part A, SOTRs received three 100-µg doses of mRNA-1273; immunocompetent participants received two doses. In Part B, an additional 100-µg dose was offered ≥4 months after the primary series. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-specific T-cell responses were measured by intracellular cytokine staining and polyfunctionality analyses. Results The primary series and additional dose of mRNA-1273 induced S protein-specific CD4+ T-cell responses exhibiting a Th-1-biased profile in both SOTRs and immunocompetent participants; however, response rates and magnitudes were lower among SOTRs. S protein-specific Th-2 CD4+ T-cell responses were below those observed for Th-1; CD8+ T-cell responses were not as robust among SOTRs compared with immunocompetent participants. Kidney SOTRs received multiple immunosuppressants and had lower cell-mediated immunity responses than liver SOTRs. Polyfunctional responses exhibited Th-1 cytokine signatures with ≤5 functional markers reported in SOTRs and immunocompetent participants. Conclusion Overall, a three-dose mRNA-1273 primary series elicited Th-1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses among SOTRs that were improved with an additional dose.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on all aspects of human activity worldwide, frequently resulting in post-acute sequelae and affecting multiple organ systems. The underlying mechanisms driving both acute and post-acute manifestations of COVID-19 are still poorly understood, warranting further investigation for new targets. The study represents the first attempt to explore the role of T-cadherin in COVID-19 pathogenesis as well as its implications in pulmonary fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. First, we revealed a significant decrease in T-cadherin expression in post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19 patients. This downregulated T-cadherin expression correlated with the elevated levels of VE-cadherin and reduced levels of β-catenin, suggesting a disruption in endothelial cell-cell contact integrity and function. Second, the reciprocal relation of T-cadherin and VE-cadherin expression was further confirmed using cultured human endothelial Ea.hy926 cells. T-cadherin overexpression caused a decrease in VE-cadherin mRNA expression in cultured endothelial cells providing additional evidence in favor of their interplay. Third, employing Cdh13 −/− mice, we unveiled the protective role of T-cadherin deficiency against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Fourth, we demonstrated the mice lacking T-cadherin to have downregulated reactive oxygen species production and Nox2 mRNA expression in an angiotensin II-mediated endothelial dysfunction model. Our findings provide rationale for further studies into T-cadherin-mediated mechanisms in these processes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background Processes related to how the intracranial microvasculature initiates brain‒peripheral crosstalk for subsequent blood‒brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction at an early stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) ictus are still unknown. This study elucidated the effect and potential mechanism of intracranial microvasculature-mediated T-cell infiltration on BBB function after SAH. Methods Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data related to SAH (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/omix; Accession No. OMIX006611) were retrieved and analyzed. The dataset was derived from the white matter region of adult male C57BL/6J mice at 1 and 7 days after experimental SAH. The SAH model was induced by endovascular perforation, and experiments were subsequently conducted at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after SAH to evaluate T-cell infiltration, BBB integrity, neuronal injury, and neurological function. Results After SAH, CXCL12 expression was increased in endothelial cells and pericytes, promoting CD8+ T-cell infiltration via the CXCR4 pathway. This immune infiltration appeared to exacerbate BBB disruption and contribute to worsened neurological function. Blocking CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling with a CXCL12 neutralizing antibody or the CXCR4-specific inhibitor AMD3100 significantly reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration, attenuated BBB damage and improved the neurobehavioral outcomes of SAH mice. Conclusion This study suggests that, following SAH, both pericytes and endothelial cells may contribute to immune regulation by producing CXCL12, which promotes CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration into the brain. This mechanism may play a role in BBB disruption and neurological dysfunction. Targeting the CXCL12–CXCR4 axis could offer a potential approach for mitigating immune-mediated injury after SAH.

        <tr id="Abstract Patients with hematologic diseases have experienced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a prolonged, progressive course. Here, we present clinical, pathological, and virological analyses of three cases of prolonged COVID-19 among patients undergoing treatment for B-cell lymphoma. These patients had all been treated with anti-CD20 antibody and bendamustine. Despite various antiviral treatments, high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) levels persisted for >4 weeks, and two of them succumbed to COVID-19. The autopsy showed bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrosis. Overlapping cytomegalovirus, fungal and/or bacterial infections were also confirmed. Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed accumulation of mutations and changes in variant allele frequencies over time. NSP12 mutations V792I and M794I appeared independently in two cases as COVID-19 progressed. In vitro drug susceptibility analysis and an animal experiment using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that each mutation, V792 and M794I, was independently responsible for remdesivir resistance and attenuated pathogenicity. E340A, E340D, and F342INS mutations in the spike protein were found in one case, which may account for the sotrovimab resistance. Analysis of autopsy specimens indicated heterogeneous distribution of these mutations. In summary, we demonstrated temporal and spatial diversity in SARS-CoV-2 that evolved resistance to various antiviral agents in malignant lymphoma patients under immunodeficient conditions caused by certain types of immunochemotherapies. Strategies may be necessary to prevent the acquisition of drug resistance and improve outcomes, such as the selection of appropriate treatment strategies for lymphoma considering patients’ immune status and the institution of early intensive antiviral therapy.">

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke triggers a cascade of pathological events that affect multiple cell types and often lead to incomplete functional recovery. Despite advances in single-cell technologies, the molecular and cellular responses that contribute to long-term post-stroke impairment remain poorly understood. To gain better insight into the underlying mechanisms, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from distinct brain regions using a mouse model of permanent focal ischemia at one month post-injury. Our findings reveal cell- and region-specific changes within the stroke-injured and peri-infarct brain tissue. For instance, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exhibited upregulated genes in signaling pathways involved in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, and downregulated pathways associated with aerobic metabolism. Using cell-cell communication analysis, we identified increased strength in predicted interactions within stroke tissue among both neural and non-neural cells via signaling pathways such as those involving collagen, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, neuronal growth regulator, laminin, and several cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between mouse transcriptome responses after stroke and those observed in human nonfatal brain stroke lesions. Common molecular features were linked to inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix organization, and angiogenesis. Our findings provide a detailed resource for advancing our molecular understanding of stroke pathology and for discovering therapeutic targets in the repair phase of stroke recovery.

We have previously shown that blocking microglial proliferation using GW2580, a selective inhibitor of CSF1R (Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor), reduced disease progression and severity and prevented the relapse phase. However, whether this was due to effects of GW2580 on the functional integrity of the BBB was not determined. Therefore, here, we examine BBB properties in rats during EAE under GW2580 treatment. Our data suggest that blocking early microglial proliferation through selective targeting of CSF1R signaling has a therapeutic effect in EAE by protecting BBB integrity and reducing peripheral immune cell infiltration. Taken together, our results identify a novel mechanism underlying the effects of GW2580, which could offer a novel therapy for MS.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to the emergence of viral variants with distinct characteristics. Understanding the differential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial for effective public health response and treatment development. We investigated the differential effects of the original Wuhan strain and the emergent Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 using a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. We compared the mortality rates, viral loads, and histopathological changes in lung and tracheal tissues, as well as alterations in the lung and intestinal microbiota following infection. Results Our findings revealed significant differences between the variants, with the Wuhan strain causing higher mortality rates, severe lung pathology, and elevated viral loads compared to the Omicron variant. Microbiome analyses uncovered novel and distinct shifts in the lung and intestinal microbiota associated with each variant, providing evidence for variant-specific microbiome alterations. These changes suggest microbiome-related mechanisms that might modulate disease severity and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions This study highlights critical differences between the Wuhan strain and Omicron variant in terms of mortality, lung pathology, and microbiota changes, emphasizing the role of the microbiome in influencing disease outcomes. Novel findings include the identification of variant-specific microbiota shifts, which underscore potential microbiome-related mechanisms underlying differences in disease severity. These insights pave the way for future research exploring microbiome-targeted interventions to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.

        <tr id="Background Mycobacterium abscessus complex pulmonary disease (MABC-PD) is a chronic and often relapsing disease with considerable morbidity, especially among individuals with other chronic pulmonary conditions. A major clinical challenge lies in distinguishing infection-related symptoms from underlying lung disease and identifying reliable prognosticators to guide treatment decisions and monitoring therapeutic response. Methodology/Principal Findings To address the gaps in clinically relevant indicators, we profiled whole blood transcriptome and 45 plasma proteins of MABC-PD patients across different disease and treatment phases. Whole blood bulk RNA-sequencing revealed that MABC-PD patients with progressive disease exhibited elevated expression of genes related to innate immune and inflammatory responses, with reduced abundance of genes associated with peripheral T and NK cells. Among the 45 plasma cytokines and chemokines profiled, plasma levels of TNFSF10 were significantly reduced, while IFNγ, interleukin-17F (IL17F) and IL17C were elevated in patients with disease progression, despite the reduced abundance of peripheral T and NK cell-associated genes, suggesting recruitment of activated T cells to infection sites in the lungs during disease progression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of IFNγ and IL17F demonstrated strong predictive performance for differentiating patients with disease progression from healthy controls, with AUCs of 0.946 (95% CI 0.829-1.000) and 0.875 (95% CI 0.6699-1), respectively. Conclusions These findings provide insights into the immune profiles of MABC-PD patients during disease progression and suggest that T cell-associated cytokines, such as IFNγ and IL17F, could serve as useful biomarkers for identifying those under watchful waiting or post-treatment who are at risk of disease progression, thereby aiding in more timely and targeted therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Background: Atherosclerosis is a progressive and complex vascular pathology characterized by cellular heterogeneity, metabolic dysregulation, and chronic inflammation. Despite extensive research, the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain incompletely understood. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to conduct a comprehensive mapping of immune cell enrichment and interactions within atherosclerotic plaques, aiming to investigate the cellular and molecular complexities of these structures. This approach facilitated a deeper understanding of the heterogeneities present in smooth muscle cells, which were subsequently analyzed using pseudotime trajectory analysis to monitor the developmental trajectories of smooth muscle cell (SMC) subpopulations. An integrative bioinformatics approach, primarily utilizing Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning techniques, identified Cathepsin C (CTSC), transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFBI), and glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG) as critical biomarkers. A diagnostic risk score model was developed and rigorously tested through Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. To illustrate the functional impact of CTSC on the regulation of plaque formation and SMC viability, both in vitro and in vivo experimental investigations were conducted. Results: An analysis revealed SMCs identified as the most prominent cellular type, exhibiting the highest density of disulfidptosis. Pseudotime trajectory analysis illuminated the dynamic activation pathways in SMCs, highlighting their significant role in plaque development and instability. Further characterization of macrophage subtypes demonstrated intercellular communication with SMCs, which exhibited specific signaling pathways, particularly between the proximal and core areas of plaques. The integrated diagnostic risk score model, which incorporates CTSC, TGFBI, and GMFG, proved to be highly accurate in distinguishing high-risk patients with elevated immune responses and systemic inflammation. Knockdown experiments of CTSC conducted in vitro revealed enhanced SMC survival rates, reduced oxidative stress, and inhibited apoptosis, while in vivo experiments confirmed a decrease in plaque burden and improvement in lipid profiles. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the significance of disulfidptosis in the development of atherosclerosis and identifies CTSC as a potential therapeutic target for stabilizing plaques by inhibiting SMC apoptosis and oxidative damage. Additionally, the risk score model serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying high-risk patients and guiding precision treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Crohn’s disease (CD) involves a complex intestinal microenvironment driven by chronic inflammation. While single-cell RNA sequencing has provided valuable insights into this biology, the spatial context is lost during single-cell preparation of mucosal biopsies. To deepen our understanding of the distinct inflammatory signatures of CD and overcome the limitations of single-cell RNA sequencing, we combined spatial transcriptomics of frozen CD surgical tissue sections with single-cell transcriptomics of ileal CD mucosa. Coexpressed genes and cell-cell communication from single-cell analyses and factorized genes from spatial transcriptomics revealed overlapping pathways affected in inflamed CD, like antigen presentation, phagosome activity, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix. Within the pathways, early epithelial cells showed evidence of significant changes in gene expression and subtype composition, while spatial mapping revealed the location of the events, particularly antigen presentation from epithelial cells in the base of the crypt. Furthermore, we identified early epithelial cells as a potential mediator of the MHC class II pathway during inflammation, which we validated by spatial transcriptomics cell subtype deconvolution. Therefore, the inflammation from CD appears to change the types of interactions detectable between epithelial cells with immune and mesenchymal cells, likely promoting the conditions for more macrophage infiltration into these inflammatory microdomains.">

        <tr id="The nature of the effector and memory T cell response in the lungs following acute SARS-CoV-2 infections remains largely unknown. To define the pulmonary T-cell response to COVID-19, we compared effector and memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in mice. Both viruses elicited potent effector T cell responses in lungs, but memory T cells showed exaggerated contraction in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, unlike the T-bet/EOMES-driven effector transcription program in IAV lungs, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells embarked on a STAT-3-centric transcriptional program, a defining characteristic of a pro-fibro-inflammatory program: limited cytotoxicity, diminished expression of tissue-protective inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT), and augmented mucosal imprinting (CD103). Circulating CD45RO+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients expressed elevated levels of STAT-3 and low levels of TIGIT. IL-6 blockade experiments implicated IL-6 in STAT-3 induction and downregulation of PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific primary effector CD8 T cells. Memory CD8 T cells specific to a single epitope, induced by mucosal vaccination, differentiated into cytotoxic effectors and expressed high levels of CD103, effectively reducing viral burden in lungs following a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings have implications for developing targeted immunotherapies to mitigate immunopathology and promote protective T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background COVID‐19 exhibits a variety of symptoms and may lead to multi‐organ failure and death. This clinical complexity is exacerbated by significant immune dysregulation affecting nearly all cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. Granulocytes, including eosinophils, are affected by SARS‐CoV‐2. Objectives Eosinophil responses remain poorly understood despite early recognition of eosinopenia as a hallmark feature of COVID‐19 severity. Results The heterogeneous nature of eosinophil responses categorizes them as dual‐function cells with contradictory effects. Eosinophil activation can suppress virus‐induced inflammation by releasing type 2 cytokines like IL‐13 and granular proteins with antiviral action such as eosinophil‐derived neurotoxins and eosinophil cationic protein, and also by acting as antigen‐presenting cells. In contrast, eosinophil accumulation in the lungs can induce tissue damage triggered by cytokines or hormones like IFN‐γ and leptin. Additionally, they can affect adaptive immune functions by interacting with T cells through direct formation of membrane complexes or soluble mediator action. Individuals with allergic disorders who have elevated levels of eosinophils in tissues and blood, such as asthma, do not appear to be at an increased risk of developing severe COVID‐19 following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. However, the SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine appears to be associated with complications and eosinophilic infiltrate‐induced immunopathogenicity, which can be mitigated by corticosteroid, anti‐histamines and anti‐IL‐5 therapy and avoided by modifying adjuvants or excipients. Conclusion This review highlights the importance of eosinophils in COVID‐19 and contributes to a better understanding of their role during natural infection and vaccination.">

        <tr id="Introduction Syphilis is a complex disease with variable clinical presentation where symptomatic and potentially infectious stages alternate with periods of latency, representing a fascinating model to study immune evasion and host immune responses. Methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC), bulk, and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin biopsies collected from subjects with secondary syphilis. Additionally, PBMCs from healthy individuals and either primary or MyD88 knock-out keratinocytes were exposed to live Treponema pallidum cells to define initial skin responses to the bacteria. Results Immunohistochemistry of secondary syphilis skin lesions showed a polymorphous immune infiltrate with colocalization of T cells, B cells and antigen–presenting cells. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct cellular contributions to the immune response, with prominent immune-stromal crosstalk accompanied by altered keratinocyte differentiation and decreased intraepidermal communication. Notably, prominent inflammatory signals were countered by concomitant regulatory responses, particularly in infiltrating myeloid cells. Exposure of PBMCs to live T. pallidum inhibited immune responses, while exposure to sonicated cells triggered CXCL1 and CXCL3 upregulation. Keratinocytes responded to both intact and sonicated T. pallidum with upregulation of type-I interferon responses that, however, were abolished in MYD88–deficient but not in STING–deficient keratinocytes. Discussion Our data provide novel insights into the contribution of epidermal TLR sensing through MYD88 to the host response to syphilis infection, highlighting mechanisms by which T. pallidum evades immune responses in skin that may facilitate transmission of this pathogen through the skin.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lung diseases are widespread worldwide. Pulmonary immunity plays a vital role against lung pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the pathogenesis, including the development of local immune responses to infection, is fundamental for developing interventions to control the viral infection. Methods Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and euthanized 11–14 days later. Results Tertiary lymphoid tissue was found in all SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. The number (13.9 vs 1.5 iPLT number/ lung cm2), size (25992 vs 13946 µm2) and total area (0.46 vs 0.02 mm2 iPLT/ lung cm2) of the lymphoid tissue aggregations were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals than that of normal controls. This induced pulmonary lymphoid tissues comprised B cells, T cells, CD169 macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells with evidence of lymphocyte priming and differentiation. Discussion The results suggest local immunity plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study of pulmonary immunity could lead to new interventions to develop vaccine strategies and discover new immune-regulatory biomarkers in monitoring and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and other lung diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to COVID19 disease and caused a worldwide pandemic in 2019. Since the first wave of infections, there has been significant antigenic shifts, leading to the emergence of new variants. Today, infections have shifted away from the severe, fatal infection seen in 2019. Objective This study aimed to assess how the plasma metabolomes from patients varied with infection with different strains and could reflect disease severity. Methods Patients with COVID19 not requiring intensive care were recruited between January 2021 and May 2022 from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham; 33 patients with alpha, 13 delta and 14 omicron variants. These were compared to 26 age matched contemporaneously recruited controls. Plasma samples were extracted into chloroform/methanol/water (1:2.5/1 v/v) and assessed by flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (FIE-MS) using an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Derived data were assessed using the R based MetaboAnalyst platform. Results Plasma metabolomes from COVID19 patients were clearly different from controls. Metabolite variation could be related to infection with different SARS-CoV2 variants. Variant showed different levels of some phospholipids, ganglioside GD1a and a dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivative. Correlations of the plasma metabolomes indicated negative correlations between selected phospholipids and the levels of C-reactive protein, creatinine, neutrophil and D-dimer. Conclusion The plasma metabolomes of COVID19 patients show changes, particularly in phospholipids, which could reflect disease severity and SARS-CoV2 variant infection.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Oxidative stress (OS) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and may be associated with sequelae after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study evaluated OS and inflammation biomarkers in blood from individuals with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). 64 male and female participants were distributed into three groups: healthy individuals (n = 20), acute COVID-19 patients (symptoms for <3 weeks, n = 15), and PASC patients (symptoms for >12 weeks, n = 29). Analyses included inflammatory cytokines, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and OS markers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), reduced glutathione (GSH), uric acid (UA), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and protein carbonyls (PC). Individuals with PASC showed increased IL-6 and IL-8. Both COVID-19 groups exhibited decreased SOD and CAT. GST decreased only in the acute group. Elevated GGT and GSH were found in the PASC group. High UA levels were observed in PASC individuals. There were no changes in TBARS values ⁣⁣in the PASC group. However, PC concentrations were elevated only in this group. Correlations were identified between inflammatory markers and OS parameters. These findings suggest that individuals with PASC pronounced OS, which potentially exacerbates disease complications. Monitoring OS biomarkers could aid in patient prognosis and management.">

        <tr id="Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop mild respiratory symptoms but also Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, severe systemic inflammation contributes to morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, followed by cleavage by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is known for its immune-modulating effects by suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing regulatory T-cells. Furthermore, it has been tested in SARS-CoV-2-related clinical trials. We set out to investigate its role in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Epithelial cells (CaCo-2) were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, treated with native VIP and analyzed to investigate the mRNA and surface expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the enzyme activity of TMPRSS2 and the infection rate by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. VIP downregulated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA and surface expression. Beyond these direct effects, VIP mediates the shedding of surface-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 via upregulation of a sheddase protease (ADAM10). Functionally, these dual mechanisms of VIP-mediated downregulation of proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry resulted in a reduced infection rate by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These data imply that VIP hampers viral entry mechanisms based on SARS-CoV-2 and the linkage to ADAM10 may stimulate research in other indications beyond SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoinflammatory disease of unknown origin, involving characterized by immune cell infiltration into the target tissue, central nervous system (CNS), resulting in local and/or systemic inflammation. The symptoms vary from gait disturbance, visual impairment and learning and memory impairment and are being managed with corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive agents. However, several patients do not respond to these treatments, which can also elevate the risk of severe infections. Therefore, there remains an ongoing need to identify new therapeutic targets. MS exhibits distinctive pathology, clinical course, and treatment responses, suggesting the importance of targeting disease site-specific immune cells to mitigate immune system-induced inflammation, rather than employing broad immunosuppression. Chemokines and chemokine receptors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MS by recruiting immune cells to the CNS, leading to inflammation and demyelination. Therapies targeting chemokines have shown promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials, but more research is needed to fully understand their mechanisms and optimize their efficacy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential players in the immune response to infections, involved in shaping innate and adaptive immunity. However, a complete understanding of their specific roles in respiratory infections, including SARS‐CoV‐2, remains elusive. Methods To investigate the dynamics of monocytes and DCs in blood as well as the upper and lower airways, we sampled 147 patients with varying degree of COVID‐19 severity longitudinally during the spring of 2020. Results Using flow cytometry, proteomics and in vitro TLR stimulation, we found differences in the distribution and function of monocytes and DCs in patients compared with controls, and importantly, reduced levels of DCs in both blood and airways. In fact, lower frequencies of cDC2s (Lin− HLA‐DR+ CD1c+) early after symptom onset predicted subsequent severe disease, and depletion of DC subsets lasted longer in patients with more severe disease. In contrast, severe COVID‐19 was associated with increased frequencies of activated monocytes in the lower, but not the upper, airways. Proteomic analysis showed that monocyte and DC‐related cytokines in plasma and airways associated with disease severity. During convalescence, cell frequencies and responses to TLR ligands normalised in blood, except for persistently low plasmacytoid DCs. Conclusion Our study reveals a distinct pattern of recruitment of monocytes but not DCs to the airways during severe COVID‐19. Instead, decreased levels of DCs in both blood and airways were found, possibly contributing to more severe COVID‐19. The connection between low blood DCs early in disease course and more severe outcomes provides insight into COVID‐19 immunopathology, with possible therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 variants present diverse clinical manifestations, necessitating deeper insights into their pathogenic effects. This study employs multi-omics approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on vascular damage. Plasma proteomic analysis of unvaccinated participants infected with Omicron BA.2.76 or ancestral variants identifies key signaling pathways associated with endothelial dysfunction, with the vinculin (VCL) pathway emerging as a hallmark of Omicron infections, contributing to lung exudation. Metabolomic analysis of plasma samples from the same cohort reveals disruptions in immune function, cell membrane integrity, and metabolic processes, including altered tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis pathways. An integrated analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data underscores the role of VCL in inflammation and extravasation, highlighting its interactions with adhesion molecules and inflammatory metabolites. A validation cohort of plasma samples from Omicron-infected participants confirms this association by replicating proteomic analysis, showing elevated VCL levels correlated with inflammatory markers. Functional studies in a male rat model of lung injury demonstrate that anti-VCL intervention reduces plasma VCL levels, mitigates alveolar edema, and restores alveolar-capillary barrier integrity, as assessed by histological staining and electron microscopy, thereby illustrating VCL modulation’s impact on vascular leakage and extravasation. These findings establish VCL as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating vascular complications in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="Somatic genetic heterogeneity resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations is widespread in human tissues and can cause diseases, however, few studies have investigated its role in neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we report the selective enrichment of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants, that are not present in neuronal, glia/stromal cells, or blood, from patients with AD in comparison to age-matched controls. Notably, microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response, both in vitro and in patients. Although the natural history of AD-associated microglial clones is difficult to establish in humans, microglial expression of a MAPK pathway activating variant was previously shown to cause neurodegeneration in mice, suggesting that AD-associated neuroinflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated a global pandemic resulting in an estimated 775 million infections with over 7 million deaths, it has become evident that COVID-19 is not solely a pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence has shown that, in a subset of patients, certain symptoms − including chest pain, stroke, anosmia, dysgeusia, diarrhea and abdominal pain – all indicate a role of vascular, neurological and gastrointestinal (GI) pathology in the disease process. Many of these disease processes persist long after the acute disease has been resolved, resulting in ‘long COVID’ or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The molecular mechanisms underlying the acute and systemic conditions associated with COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Appropriate animal models provide a method of understanding underlying disease mechanisms at the system level through the study of disease progression, tissue pathology, immune system response to the pathogen and behavioral responses. However, very few studies have addressed PASC and whether existing models hold promise for studying this challenging problem. Here, we review the current literature on cardiovascular, neurological and GI pathobiology caused by COVID-19 in patients, along with established animal models of the acute disease manifestations and their prospects for use in PASC studies. Our aim is to provide guidance for the selection of appropriate models in order to recapitulate certain aspects of the disease to enhance the translatability of mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Objectives/Goals: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to impact multiple organ systems, including the brain, and is associated with increased cognitive decline in vulnerable populations. The gut microbiome may play a significant role in modulating these effects, as shifts in microbiota composition have been linked to inflammation and systemic disease processes. Methods/Study Population: To explore these interactions, we conducted an acute COVID-19 study using 12-week-old C57 mice intranasally inoculated with 1x10^4 PFU of the Mouse Adapted 10 (MA-10) strain of SARS-CoV-2. On day 5 postinfection, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing on fecal samples, analyzed using QIIME2 and DeSeq2, to assess microbiome alterations and identify changes in metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory responses. Results/Anticipated Results: Analysis revealed notable shifts in the gut microbiome during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, with significant alterations in metabolic pathways related to inflammation and immune regulation. These changes suggest that early gut microbiome disruptions may contribute to the host response in acute COVID-19. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Our findings indicate that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to rapid alterations in the gut microbiome, which could underlie inflammatory and immune pathways impacting disease progression. These insights highlight the potential for microbiome-targeted therapies to mitigate acute COVID-19 morbidity and warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="Pulmonary fibrosis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19. β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, has been shown to be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis). In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-hACE2 cell model to evaluate the efficacy of the A549-hACE2 monoclonal cell line against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The A549-hACE2 cells were then subjected to either knockdown or overexpression of the effector β-catenin, and the modified cells were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we employed transcriptomics and raw letter analysis approaches to investigate other potential effects of β-catenin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We successfully established a model of cellular fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung-derived cells. This model can be utilized to investigate the molecular biological mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways associated with virus-induced lung fibrosis. The results of our mechanistic studies indicate that β-catenin plays a significant role in lung fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the inhibition of β-catenin mitigated the accumulation of mesenchymal stroma in A549-hACE2 cells. Additionally, β-catenin knockdown was found to facilitate multi-pathway crosstalk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that β-catenin overexpression did not exacerbate cellular fibrosis may be attributed to the activation of PPP2R2B.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection primarily affects the respiratory system but may induce hematological alterations such as anemia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Previous studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs); however, the subsequent effects on hematopoiesis and immune reconstitution have not yet been described. Here we evaluated the pathological effects of infection of umbilical-cord-blood-derived HSPCs with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant pseudovirus (PsV). Transcriptomic analysis of Omicron PsV-infected HSPCs revealed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation, aging and the NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting a potential trigger of inflammaging. Omicron PsV-infected HSPCs presented decreased numbers of multipotential progenitors (granulocyte‒erythrocyte‒macrophage‒megakaryocyte colony-forming units) ex vivo and repopulated primitive hematopoietic stem cells (Ki-67−hCD34+ cells) in an HSPC transplantation NOD-scid IL2rγnull mouse model (Omicron mouse). Furthermore, Omicron PsV infection induced myeloid-biased differentiation of HSPCs. Treatment with nanographene oxide, an antiviral agent, partially mitigated the myeloid bias and inflammaging phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insights into the abnormal hematopoietic and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight potential therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The SAR-CoV-2 virus has evolved to co-exist with human hosts, albeit at a substantial energetic cost resulting in post-infection neurological manifestations [Neuro-post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)] that significantly impact public health and economic productivity on a global scale. One of the main molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of Neuro-PASC, in individuals of all ages, is the formation and inadequate proteolysis/clearance of phase-separated amyloid crystalline aggregates—a hallmark feature of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders. Amyloidogenesis during viral infection and persistence is a natural, inevitable, protective defense response that is exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2. Acting as chemical catalyst, SARS-CoV-2 accelerates hydrophobic collapse and the heterogeneous nucleation of amorphous amyloids into stable β-sheet aggregates. The clearance of amyloid aggregates is most effective during slow wave sleep, when high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—a biphasic modulator of biomolecular condensates—and melatonin are available to solubilize amyloid aggregates for removal. The dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics by SARS-CoV-2, in particular fusion and fission homeostasis, impairs the proper formation of distinct mitochondrial subpopulations that can remedy challenges created by the diversion of substrates away from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis to support viral replication and maintenance. The subsequent reduction of ATP and inhibition of melatonin synthesis during slow wave sleep results in incomplete brain clearance of amyloid aggregates, leading to the development of neurological manifestations commonly associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Exogenous melatonin not only prevents mitochondrial dysfunction but also elevates ATP production, effectively augmenting the solubilizing effect of the adenosine moiety to ensure the timely, optimal disaggregation and clearance of pathogenic amyloid aggregates in the prevention and attenuation of Neuro-PASC.">

        <tr id="Studies on human respiratory viral infections and pathogenesis have historically been conducted using immortalized cells and animal models. However, these models are limited in their ability to recapitulate the complex structure of the human airway or the full spectrum of disease symptoms observed in humans. Recently, nose and lung organoids have revolutionized culture complexity in infection biology and have demonstrated potential for research on respiratory virus infections in humans. In this opinion, we review how advances in human nose and lung organoid models, which are able to express all cell types of the respiratory epithelia, i.e., Club, basal, goblet, and ciliated cells, have provided novel insight into the pathogenesis, age-dependent susceptibility, viral attenuation signature, and immune mechanisms of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. The models have also demonstrated potential for studying hitherto uncultivable human viruses and to be useful for studies of zoonotic risk.">

        <tr id="Approximately four months after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection, around 25% of individuals developed visuoconstructive deficit (VCD), which was found to be correlated with an increase in peripheral immune markers and alterations in structural and metabolic brain imaging. Recently, it has been demonstrated that supplemental vitamin B12 regulates hyperinflammation during moderate and severe COVID-19 through methyl-dependent epigenetic mechanisms. Herein, whole peripheral blood cultures were produced using samples obtained from patients with confirmed persistent VCD, and controls without impairment, between 10 and 16 months after mild COVID-19. This experimental model was used to assess the leukocyte expression patterns of 11 biomarkers previously associated with VCD in long COVID and explore the potential of pharmacological B12 in regulating these genes. The results showed that patients with persistent VCD displayed continued upregulation of CCL11 and LIF compared to controls. It is worth noting that elevated serum levels of CCL11 have been previously linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, the addition of 1 nM of vitamin B12 to blood cultures from individuals with VCD normalized the mRNA levels of CCL11, upregulated the neuroprotective HGF, and, to a lesser extent, downregulated CSF2 and CXCL10. There was an inverse correlation observed between CCL11 mRNA levels and methylation levels of specific cytosines in its promoter region. These findings underscore the significance of systemic inflammation in persistent VCD associated with long COVID. Moreover, the study provides evidence suggesting that B12, acting as an epidrug, shows promise as a therapeutic approach for addressing this cognitive impairment.

        <tr id="The immune system’s response to an invading pathogen is the critical determinant in recovery from illness. Here, we hypothesize that the immune response will swiftly follow classical activation and a resolution trajectory in patients with the rapid evolution of symptoms if challenged by a viral pathogen for the first time. Alternatively, a dysregulated response will be signified by a protracted clinical trajectory. Consequently, we enrolled 106 patients during the first wave of COVID-19 and collected their blood within 24 h, 48 h, 7 days, and over 28 days from symptoms onset. The pathogenic burden was measured via serum levels of the S-spike protein and specific immunoglobulin titers against the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The nonspecific immunological response was gauged using interleukin 6, leukocytosis, and C-reactive protein. Coagulation status was assessed. Several serum biomarkers were used as surrogates of clinical outcomes. We identified four clusters depending on the onset of symptoms (immediate [A], 6 days [B], 12 days [C], and over 21 days [D]). High variability in the S-spike protein in cluster A was present. The corresponding immunoglobulin titer was random. Only procalcitonin differentiated clusters in terms of markers of nonspecific inflammation. Coagulation markers were not significantly different between clusters. Serum surrogates on cardiomyopathy and neuronal pathology exhibited significant variability. Implementation of ECMO or noninvasive ventilation was more prominent in cluster C and D. Interestingly, SOFA or APACHE II scores were not different between nominal (A and B) versus dysregulated clusters (C and D).">

        <tr id="CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. While most infected people experienced mild illness, others progressed to severe disease, characterized by hyperinflammation and respiratory distress. There is still much to learn about the innate immune response to this virus. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor that is activated when pattern recognition receptors detect viruses. Upon activation, IRF3 induces the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) and interferon-stimulated genes, which protect the host from viral infection. However, coronaviruses antagonize this pathway, delaying type 1 IFN production. It is, therefore, unclear how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. Our prior reports showed that IRF3 promotes harmful inflammation during bacterial sepsis in mice. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that IRF3 cannot effectively control the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and instead promotes harmful inflammation during severe COVID-19. METHODS AND MODELS: We used mice transgenic for the human angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 transgene, driven by the keratin 18 promoter (K18-ACE2 mice) that were IRF3 deficient or IRF3 sufficient to test how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, K18-ACE2 mice showed a dose-dependent disease, characterized by mortality, lethargy, weight loss, and lung pathology, reminiscent of clinical COVID-19. However, K18-ACE2 mice lacking IRF3 were protected from severe disease with reduced mortality (84.6% vs. 100%) and disease score. We found that IRF3 promoted IFN-β production in the lungs and reprogrammed the cytokine profile, while viral load in the lungs was similar in the presence or absence of IRF3. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that IRF3 played a detrimental role in murine COVID-19 associated with changes in IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines.">

Type III interferons (IFN), including IFN lambda 4 (IFNλ4), expressed in individuals harboring the rs368234815-ΔG allele, are implicated in host immune responses to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.We investigated associations between IFNλ4 expression through genotyping and COVID-19 disease severity in 853 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases enrolled in the All-Ireland Infectious Diseases Cohort. Additionally, we measured plasma levels of Type I, II and III IFN using quantitative immunoassays along with IFNλ4 expression and COVID-19 disease severity in a sub-group [n=321 (37.6%)] with samples available within 10 days of symptom onset. IFNλ4 was expressed in 382 (44.8%) but expression was not significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity.Within the sub-group, we found no consistent associations between IFNλ4 expression and circulating IFNs. However, we observed significantly increased expression of IFNλ1 and IFNλ2 in severe COVID-19 (P<0.01), with IFNλ2 remaining significantly associated after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities, including obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) (P<0.001). Interestingly, although IFNλ2 levels were significantly higher in subjects with obesity, the association between higher IFNλ2 and COVID-19 disease severity was only observed in individuals without obesity (P<0.01).These data reveal an important role for IFNλ2 as an immune correlate that predicts COVID-19 disease severity, which may be masked in those with obesity.">

        <tr id="Excessive inflammation and cytokine release are hallmarks of severe COVID-19. Certain programmed cell death processes can drive inflammation, however, their role in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is unclear. Pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of regulated cell death initiated by inflammasomes and executed by the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). Using an established mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus and a panel of gene-targeted mice we found that deletion of the inflammasome (NLRP1/3 and the adaptor ASC) and pore forming proteins involved in pyroptosis (GSDMA/C/D/E) only marginally reduced IL-1β levels and did not impact disease outcome or viral loads. Furthermore, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not trigger GSDMD activation in mouse lungs. Finally, we did not observe any difference between WT animals and mice with compound deficiencies in the pro-inflammatory initiator caspases (C1/11/12-/-). This indicates that the classical canonical and non-canonical pro-inflammatory caspases known to process and activate pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and GSDMD do not substantially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. However, the loss of IL-1β, but not the absence of IL-18, ameliorated disease and enhanced survival in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals compared to wildtype mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that IL-1β is an important factor contributing to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, but its release was largely independent of inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways.">

        <tr id="The progression of COVID-19 involves a sophisticated and intricate interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host’s immune response. The immune system employs both innate and adaptive mechanisms to combat infection. Innate immunity initiates the release of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the adaptive immune response involves CD4+ Th lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and CD8+ Tc cells. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), activating the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling pathway, a crucial component of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This pathway fulfills a dual function during infection. In the early phase of infection, the virus can suppress cGAS-STING signaling to avoid immune detection. However, in the late stages, the activation of this pathway may trigger excessive inflammation and tissue damage, exacerbating disease severity. Modulating the cGAS-STING pathway, whether through agonists like dimeric amidobenzimidazole (diABZI) or inhibitors targeting viral proteins, such as 3CLpro, for example, offers a promising approach for personalized therapy to control the immune response and mitigate severe inflammation, ultimately improving clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is widely posited to be a key pathogenic mechanism linking acute organophosphate (OP)-induced status epilepticus (SE) to persistent brain injury and abnormal electrical activity that contribute to epilepsy and cognitive impairment. The plasminogen activation system (PAS) promotes neuroinflammation in diverse neurological diseases but whether it is activated following acute OP intoxication has yet to be evaluated. To address this data gap, we characterized the spatiotemporal expression patterns of multiple components of the PAS in a rat model of acute intoxication with the OP, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Adult male Sprague Dawley rats administered DFP (4 mg/kg, sc), atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, im) and 2-pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, im) went into SE that persisted for hours. One day after acute DFP-induced SE, plasmin activity and protein concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the plasma were increased, though not significantly. In contrast, acute DFP intoxication significantly increased brain levels of PAI-1, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and transcripts of TGF-β in a time- and region-dependent manner. In the cortex and hippocampus, quantification of PAI-1, tPA, and uPA by ELISA indicated significantly increased levels at 1 day post-exposure (DPE). PAI-1 and uPA returned to control values by 7 DPE while tPA protein remained elevated at 28 DPE. Immunohistochemistry detected elevated PAI-1 expression in the DFP brain up to 28 DPE. Co-localization of PAI-1 with biomarkers of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes demonstrated that PAI-1 localized predominantly to a subpopulation of astrocytes. Cytologically, PAI-1 localized to astrocytic end feet, but not adjacent neurovascular endothelium. Electron microscopy revealed neuronal metabolic stress and neurodegeneration with disruption of adjacent neurovascular units in the hippocampus post-DFP exposure. These data indicate that acute DFP intoxication altered PAS expression in the brain, with aberrant PAI-1 expression in a subset of reactive astrocyte populations.

Single-cell RNA-sequencing (PANS n=2 vs controls n=2) confirmed these findings but showed heterogeneity across immune cell types. Toll-like receptor stimulation assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed reduced TNF and interleukin-6 responses in PANS patients (n=7) compared to controls (n=7). RNA sequencing before and after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in PANS patients (n=9 vs controls n=10) revealed reversal of the dysregulated ribosomal, epigenetic, and cell signaling pathways. Given the central role of the immune system in synaptic pruning and neurodevelopment, these insights provide rationale for novel epigenetic and immune modulating therapies to optimize neurodevelopmental trajectories and minimize neuropsychiatric impairment.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Co‐infection with HIV and SARS‐CoV‐2 presents a complex clinical picture. Deciphering the immune response in this population, particularly the role of cytokines underlying immunopathogenesis could elucidates the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Methods This prospective, two‐stage study enrolled 75 individuals with HIV diagnosed with COVID‐19 (case group) and 25 individuals from the general population infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 only (control group). COVID‐19 diagnosis followed World Health Organization guidelines. Plasma cytokine levels were measured using a cytokine bead array. Results The case group skewed slightly females (61.2% vs. 42.9% female in the control group) an average age of 3 years older (44.13 years vs. 40.86 years). Importantly, all the case group participants had mild complications, while a significant majority (88.1%) in the control group experienced severe complications. The control group displayed a substantially higher IgM titer 963 IU/mL compared to only 39.3 IU/mL in the case group. The control group had significantly higher levels of IL‐6, IL‐10, IFN‐γ, TNF‐α compared to the case group. Conclusion This study suggests a potentially distinct immune response in HIV‐positive patients when infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Elucidating these differences could lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.">

        <tr id="Long COVID has emerged as a significant challenge since the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared as an outbreak in March 2020, marked by diverse symptoms and prolonged duration of disease. Defined by the WHO as symptoms persisting or emerging for at least two months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection without an alternative cause, its prevalence varies globally, with estimates of 10–20% in Europe, 7.3% in the USA, and 3.0% in the UK. The condition’s etiology remains unclear, involving factors, such as renin–angiotensin system overactivation, persistent viral reservoirs, immune dysregulation, and autoantibodies. Reactivated viruses, like EBV and HSV-6, alongside epigenetic alterations, exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and energy imbalance. Emerging evidence links SARS-CoV-2 to chromatin and gut microbiome changes, further influencing long-term health impacts. Diagnosis of long COVID requires detailed systemic evaluation through medical history and physical examination. Management is highly individualized, focusing mainly on the patient’s symptoms and affected systems. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, integrating diverse perspectives to address systemic manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Enhanced understanding of long COVID’s pathophysiology and clinical features is critical to improving patient outcomes and quality of life. With a growing number of cases expected globally, advancing research and disseminating knowledge on long COVID remain vital for developing effective diagnostic and management frameworks, ultimately supporting better care for affected individuals.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 is characterized by the persistence of symptoms and immune alterations beyond the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the demographic, clinical, and immunological differences between individuals with and without long COVID-19 is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This observational study included 206 participants, comprising 90 patients with long COVID-19 and 116 without. Data on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were collected, alongside immune cell profiles and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Statistical analyses compared these parameters between the two groups. Long COVID-19 patients were predominantly female (77.8%), older (47.78% aged 41–60, 20% >60 years), and had higher BMI, hypertension (31.1%), and autoimmune diseases (11.1%) compared to nonlong COVID-19 individuals (P < 0.001). Clinical symptoms unique to long COVID-19 included memory loss (40.0%), hair loss (37.8%), fatigue (35.6%), and myalgia/arthralgia (28.9%), all absent in the control group (P < 0.001). Immunologically, patients with long COVID-19 exhibited distinct immune profiles, including elevated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+), reduced B cells, and higher CD4/CD8 ratios. Moreover, long COVID-19 patients had higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, with 15.5% showing levels between 1000–2500 BAU/ml, compared to 6.9% in controls. These immunological biomarkers, including altered T cell subsets and antibody levels, highlight the complex immune dysregulation associated with long COVID-19. These findings could inform future clinical management and therapeutic strategies targeting immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="Purpose of review Nonhuman primate (NHP) models of HIV-1 infection provide complementary experimental pathways for assessing aspects of acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) that cannot be addressed in humans. This article reviews acute infection studies in SIV-infected or SHIV-infected macaque species over the previous 18 months. Recent findings Reviewed studies examined the dynamics of replication-competent viral reservoir establishment during early infection, reservoir maintenance throughout therapy, and factors influencing viral rebound after treatment cessation. Also discussed are acute infection events in the central nervous system and liver and potential links between these events and manifestations of comorbidities during chronic infection. Additional studies addressed how occurrences during acute infection impact the development of natural viral control or posttreatment control. Another report evaluated treatment during acute infection with broadly neutralizing antibodies with enhanced ability to engage innate immune cells, highlighting the ability of this early intervention to shape innate and adaptive antiviral responses. Summary NHP models of HIV-1 infection are a fundamental research tool for investigating AHI events. These models enable detailed pathogenesis characterization and the testing of hypothesis-driven strategies for altering disease courses through interventions during AHI, including targeting viral persistence and comorbidities that persist throughout chronic infection.">

        <tr id="Since SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented changes in the epidemiology of other infectious diseases, investigations on coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and one of the famous vector-borne diseases, malaria, are crucial for disease control, especially in malaria-endemic areas. The clinical profiles, possible mechanisms for interactions, and representative control measures of COVID-19 and malaria coinfections have recently garnered public attention. The overlap in epidemiology, infection incubation, and clinical symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria coinfections has been thoroughly discussed to provide a detailed diagnostic procedure for coinfections, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions. Immunological and genetic evidence has shown that previous malaria exposure may protect the body from the poor prognosis of COVID-19. ACE2 downregulation and TLR-induced pathways play a role in this protective effect, as do CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell activation and coinhibitory receptor upregulation, which help maintain a balance of immune reactions. Finally, multiple control measures for coinfections were discussed, and malaria control efforts were enriched in the context of COVID-19. These efforts included (1) developing vaccinations; (2) evaluating the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment; (3) exploring recent advances in natural products that are potentially useful for coinfection treatment; (4) researching and implementing bioinsecticides for malaria control, such as gene-driven mosquitoes, fungi, and bacterial symbionts; and (5) improving national electronic disease surveillance platforms in malaria-endemic regions. At last, the above findings summarized valuable lessons about malaria and COVID-19 control and expedite further investigations on coinfections with complex clinical presentations.

        <tr id="Background and objectives Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) bring cancer patients tumor control and survival benefits, yet they also trigger immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), notably checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP), affecting about 5% of patients among whom 1–2% experiencing severe grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Current research points to potential links with T cell subset dysfunction and autoantibody increase, but the specific mechanisms underlying different grades of CIP are understudied. Methods Herein, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from CIP patients across varying severity levels, aiming to elucidate underlying immune environment and mechanisms of CIP progression at cellular and molecular levels. Findings Totally, 121,409 high qualified cells from BALF of 11 patients were annotated and categorized into five major cell types. Severe CIP (CIP-S) cases have a significant increase in the percentage of unreported epithelial cells in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with mild CIP (CIP-M) cases. These cells were defined as aberrant basaloid cells. They upregulated SOX9, increased the expression of CXCL3/5, recruited neutrophils, and activated the immune system. Additionally, macrophages in the CIP-S group had stronger antigen-presenting abilities and resulted in more CD8 + effective T cells infiltrated. Conclusions Utilizing single-cell sequencing of BALF, we discovered an enriched population of aberrant basaloid cells in CIP-S patients, which had not been previously reported. Aberrant basaloid cells may upregulate SOX9 via CXCL3/5-CXCR2 to recruit and activate neutrophils, and further activate the immune system, resulting in CIP-S. This finding could identify new targets for stratified treatment of CIP patients, holding promise of a novel approach for clinical guidance.

        <tr id="Background: The coronavirus–caused disease (COVID-19), first identified in China in December 2019, has spread worldwide becoming a global pandemic. Although people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus presented mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, an increase in cardiovascular incidents was observed in several scientific studies. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to disrupt the normal immune response leading to a dysregulation of immune system function and massive production of inflammatory cytokines commonly known as “cytokine storm”. Methods: 57 patients eventually participated in the study, assigned to non–COVID (24 patients) and COVID (33 patients) groups. After signing consent to participate in the study, each patient was given a self–administered questionnaire to fill out prior to specimen collection, anthropometric measurements were taken and venous blood was collected for the following determinations: pro- and anti–inflammatory cytokines using a Bio–Plex 200 system, oxidative stress markers and basic hematological blood parameters. Results: showed statistically significant higher values of IL–1Ra and IL–1β in the COVID-19 group. Of the oxidative stress markers, only MDA levels were higher in the COVID-19 group. Conclusions: the results of our study provide evidence and support the occurrence of elevated levels of IL–1Ra, IL–1β and MDA in the COVID-19 group of patients, which are associated with a worse course and prognosis of COVID-19. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and dysregulation of the immune system associated with the cytokine storm is essential to select patients at risk and develop effective drugs and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combination with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

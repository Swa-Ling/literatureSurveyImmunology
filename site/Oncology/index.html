        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is accompanied by elevated liver enzymes, and patients with pre‐existing liver conditions experience more severe disease. While it was known that SARS‐CoV‐2 infects human hepatocytes, our study determines the mechanism of infection, demonstrates viral replication and spread, and highlights direct hepatocyte damage. Viral replication was readily detectable upon infection of primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells with the ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2, Delta, and Omicron variants. Hepatocytes express the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor ACE2 and the host cell protease TMPRSS2, and knocking down ACE2 and TMPRSS2 impaired SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Progeny viruses released from infected hepatocytes showed the typical coronavirus morphology by electron microscopy and proved infectious when transferred to fresh cells, indicating that hepatocytes can contribute to virus spread. Importantly, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection rapidly induced hepatocyte death in a replication‐dependent fashion, with the Omicron variant showing faster onset but less extensive cell death. C57BL/6 wild‐type mice infected with a mouse‐adapted SARS‐CoV‐2 strain showed high levels of viral RNA in liver and lung tissues. ALT peaked when viral RNA was cleared from the liver. Liver histology revealed profound tissue damage and immune cell infiltration, indicating that direct cytopathic effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 and immune‐mediated killing of infected hepatocytes contribute to liver pathology.">

Single-cell transcriptomics has provided the scope of investigating cellular and molecular underpinnings of host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high resolution. In this review, we have systematically described the virus-induced dysregulation of relative abundance as well as molecular behavior of each innate and adaptive immune cell type and cell state during COVID-19 infection and for different vaccinations, based on single-cell studies published in last three-four years. Identification and characterization of these disease-associated specific cell populations might help to design better, efficient, and targeted therapeutic avenues.">

        <tr id="Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations in infants and poses a significantly higher risk of respiratory failure than SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. We analyzed blood samples from infants (median age 2.3 months) with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 30), RSV (n = 19), and healthy controls (n = 17) using single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, and cytokine profiling. Both viruses triggered comparable interferon responses across PBMC subsets but differed in NK cell and inflammatory responses. Severe RSV cases showed reduced NK cell frequencies, lower IFNG expression, and decreased chromatin accessibility at T-BET and EOMES binding sites. RSV infections were also associated with increased CD4 + T EMRA , memory T reg and transitional B cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was characterized by stronger pro-inflammatory signatures, including increased NFKB pathway activity and higher serum TNF concentrations. These findings highlight distinct immune responses to RSV and SARS-CoV-2, providing insights that may inform clinical decisions.">

The adaptive immune responses generated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination include humoral and cellular immune responses. Most studies on the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have focused primarily on humoral immunity, but cellular immunity is vital for effectively controlling progression to severe COVID-19. In SOTRs, the vaccine-induced adaptive immune response is significantly attenuated compared to the response in healthy individuals. Nevertheless, vaccinated SOTRs exhibit a reduced rate and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review aims to provide a concise overview of the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune responses in SOTRs.">

        <tr id="Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has been the most severe public health emergency since 2019. Currently, the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the most dominant. The most prominent symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory. Meanwhile, the fatality of COVID-19 was mainly from pneumonia. However ,in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have pneumonia and those who do not, the differences in the immune repertoire still require further investigation. Methods We conducted seven-chain adaptome immune repertoire analyses on patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, both with and without pulmonary infiltration. Results Patients with pulmonary infiltration exhibit lymphopenia, a decreased proportion of the overall TCR repertoire alongside an increased BCR repertoire, reduced IGHD and IGHM isotype expression, a shorter mean CDR3 length for TRG, and a longer mean length for TRD, as well as diminished clonality and diversity in the TCR/BCR repertoire. Meanwhile, patients with pulmonary infiltration have distinct V-J gene usage and unique CDR3 signature, as well as BCR class switch recombination pattern. Finally, prior vaccination triggered less BCR IGHM/IGHD somatic hypermutation response, preserved the diversity of the entire adaptive immune repertoire, and provided clinical protection against severe or critical conditions following Omicron infection. Discussion We report a unique, comprehensive adaptive immune system signature in patients with pulmonary infiltration, which may serve as potential immunological biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Current understanding of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and host responses driving the pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate gene expression patterns during acute SARS-CoV-2 illness. Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples. We also generated expression data on the human nose organoid model during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The human nose organoid-generated host transcriptional response captured many aspects of responses observed in the above patient samples, while suggesting the existence of distinct host responses to SARS-CoV-2 depending on the cellular context, involving both epithelial and cellular immune responses. Our findings provide a catalog of SARS-CoV-2 host response genes changing over time and magnitude of these host responses were significantly correlated to viral load.">

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to have neurotropism and therefore to lead to not only peripheral inflammatory responses but also neuroinflammation. Because the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), can be found in many intraocular tissues, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also contribute to persistent intraocular neuroinflammation, microcirculation dysfunction and ocular symptoms. Increased awareness of neuroinflammation and future research on interventional strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are important for improving long-term outcomes, reducing disease burden, and improving quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this review is to focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and intraocular neuroinflammation and to discuss current evidence and future perspectives, especially possible connections between conditions and potential treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Few pathogens have historically been subjected to as intense scientific and clinical scrutiny as SARS-CoV-2. The genetic, immunological, and environmental factors influencing disease severity and post-infection clinical outcomes, known as correlates of immunity, remain largely undefined. Clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to those with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms. While most infected individuals return to their former health and fitness within a few weeks, some develop debilitating chronic symptoms, referred to as long-COVID. Autoimmune responses have been proposed as one of the factors influencing long-COVID and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between viral infections and autoimmune pathologies is not new. Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, among others, have been shown to induce the production of autoantibodies and the onset of autoimmune conditions. Given the extensive literature on SARS-CoV-2, here we review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmune pathologies, with a focus on autoantibodies. We closely examine mechanisms driving autoantibody production, particularly their connection with disease severity and long-COVID.">

Coronavirus interactions with host innate immune antiviral responses are an important determinant of disease outcome. This review compares the host's innate response to different human coronaviruses. Host antiviral defenses discussed in this review include frontline defenses against respiratory viruses in the nasal epithelium, early sensing of viral infection by innate immune effectors, double-stranded RNA and stress-induced antiviral pathways, and viral antagonism of innate immune responses conferred by conserved coronavirus nonstructural proteins and genus-specific accessory proteins. The common cold coronaviruses HCoV-229E and -NL63 induce robust interferon signaling and related innate immune pathways, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 induce intermediate levels of activation, and MERS-CoV shuts down these pathways almost completely.">

        <tr id="Objective Vaccination is protective against severe COVID-19 disease, yet whether vaccination reduces COVID-19-associated inflammation in pregnancy has not been established. The objective of this study is to characterize maternal and cord cytokine profiles of acute SARS-CoV-2 “breakthrough” infection (BTI) after vaccination, compared with unvaccinated infection and uninfected controls. Study design 66 pregnant individuals enrolled in the MGH COVID-19 biorepository (March 2020-April 2022) were included. Maternal sera were collected from 26 unvaccinated and 21 vaccinated individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cord sera were collected at delivery. Maternal and cord sera from 19 term dyads without current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed as controls. Cytokines were quantified using the Human Inflammation 20-Plex ProcartaPlex assay. Results There was a significantly higher incidence of severe/critical maternal illness in unvaccinated pregnant individuals with SARS-CoV-2 compared to vaccinated (10/26 (38%) vs. 0/21 (0%), p<0.01). Significantly higher maternal levels of TNFα and CD62P were observed in vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 BTI compared with unvaccinated individuals with infection (p<0.05). Network correlation analyses revealed a distinct maternal cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals. Neither unvaccinated nor vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in elevated cord cytokines compared to controls. Multivariate analyses demonstrate distinct maternal and cord cytokine profiles in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 at delivery. Conclusion Vaccination was associated with higher maternal cytokine levels during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to unvaccinated infection, which may reflect vaccine-mediated priming of the immune system. A fetal inflammatory response specific to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed.">

        <tr id="The high transmissibility and mutation ability of coronaviruses enable them to easily escape existing immune protection and also pose a challenge to existing antiviral drugs. Moreover, drugs only targeting viruses cannot always attenuate the "cytokine storm". Herein, a synthetic heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic, HMSA-06 is reported, that exhibited antiviral activities against both the SARS-CoV-2 prototype and Omicron strains by targeting viral entry and replication. Of particular note, HMSA-06 demonstrated more potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects than PG545 and Roneparstat. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to hijack autophagy to facilitate its replication, therefore boosting autophagy can attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is revealed that HMSA-06, but not a similar HS mimetic that failed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, can upregulate cellular autophagy flux. In addition, HMSA-06 was found to robustly block the NLRP3-mediated inflammatory reaction in SARS-CoV-2 infected THP-1 derived macrophages as evidenced by a reduction in inflammasome formation and the subsequent decreased secretion of mature caspase-1 and IL-1β. The HMSA-06's inflammation inhibitory function is further confirmed using a LPS/ATP-stimulated THP-1 macrophage model. Altogether, this study has identified a promising HS mimetic to combat SARS-CoV-2-associated diseases by inhibiting viral infection and attenuating viral-induced inflammatory reaction, providing insights into the development of novel anti-coronavirus drugs in the future.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to over 670 million infections and nearly 7 million deaths worldwide. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has precipitated a significant public health crisis. The prevalence of liver function abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 53% among healthy individuals or patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and shows a positive correlation with disease severity; moreover, specific adaptive immune responses can influence the trajectory and outcomes of COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 may impact autoimmunity through mechanisms such as excessive stimulation of immune responses and molecular mimicry, particularly in genetically predisposed individuals. Currently, the overall mutational trend of SARS-CoV-2 indicates heightened infectivity and immune evasion capabilities. Consequently, vaccination remains crucial for universal protection against this disease. Nevertheless, alongside the widespread implementation of vaccination programs globally, an increasing number of cases have been documented where COVID-19 vaccination appears to trigger new-onset autoimmune hepatitis; yet definitive evidence is still pending elucidation regarding causality. In this review, we analyse the clinical-immunological characteristics, risks associated with severe disease progression, and prognosis for AIH patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; discuss the detrimental effects exerted by SARS-CoV-2 on hepatic function; summarise the mechanisms and attributes leading to new-onset AIH; as well as provide insights into how vaccination may interfere with autoimmunity processes. We continue to underscore the significance of vaccination while aiming to enhance awareness concerning potential risks associated with it—this could facilitate better management strategies for autoimmune diseases along with appropriate adjustments in vaccination protocols. Although the precise triggering mechanism linking COVID-19-related events to AIH remains unclear, existing evidence suggests that this relationship is far from coincidental.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) exhibit differences in their inflammatory responses and pulmonary damage, yet the specific mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein inhibits the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and downstream signal transduction by impeding the assembly of the transforming growth factor β-activated kinase1 (TAK1)-TAK1 binding protein 2/3 (TAB2/3) complex. In contrast, the SARS-CoV N protein does not impact the NF-κB pathway. By comparing the amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV N proteins, we identified Glu-290 and Gln-349 as critical residues in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, essential for its antagonistic function. These findings were further validated in a SARS-CoV-2 trans-complementation system using cellular and animal models. Our results reveal the distinctions in inflammatory responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, highlighting the significance of specific amino acid alterations in influencing viral pathogenicity.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an RNA virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the lungs and airways, it can also infect other organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the choroid plexus could serve as a potential entry site for SARS-CoV-2 into the brain. Tissue samples from 24 deceased COVID-19-positive individuals were analyzed. Reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on selected brain regions, including the choroid plexus, to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy were used to detect and localize two characteristic proteins of SARS-CoV-2: the spike protein S1 and the nucleocapsid protein. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the choroid plexus. Immunohistochemical staining revealed viral particles localized in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, with the spike protein S1 detected in the late endosomes. Our findings suggest that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (B-CSF) barrier in the choroid plexus serves as a route of entry for SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS. This study contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying CNS involvement in COVID-19 and highlights the importance of further research to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting this entry pathway.">

        <tr id="The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has underscored the significance of viral infections, affecting billions of lives and costing trillions of dollars globally. Even beyond SARS-CoV-2, common infections with viruses like influenza, HIV, and herpesviruses have profound impacts beyond their typical manifestations, often triggering acute and chronic pain syndromes that can be life-altering. These virally induced pain states can arise through direct viral replication within neurons, or indirectly, via immune responses to infection in both the contexts of afferent signaling in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) or subsequent higher order integration in intracranial systems. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2 each provide a unique lens through which to examine the interplay between viral activity and pain. This perspective paper is not meant to be an exhaustive review of virally-induced neuropathic pain states. It seeks to explore curated aspects of the complexities of these pain states, identify research gaps, and suggest solutions using nanoscale molecular understanding and psychoneuroimmunological and biopsychosocial frameworks. Each subheading is accompanied by a list of related issues for study which we think will lead to advances in our understanding of the vexing pain phenotype associated with viral infection.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus responsible for COVID-19, interacts with the host immune system through complex mechanisms that significantly influence disease outcomes, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity. These interactions are crucial in determining the disease's severity and the host's ability to clear the virus. Given the virus's substantial socioeconomic impact, high morbidity and mortality rates, and public health importance, understanding these mechanisms is essential. This article examines the diverse innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2's structural proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, along with nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open reading frames. These proteins play pivotal roles in immune modulation, facilitating viral replication, evading immune detection, and contributing to severe inflammatory responses such as cytokine storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus employs strategies like suppressing type I interferon production and disrupting key antiviral pathways, including MAVS, OAS-RNase-L, and PKR. This study also explores the immune pathways that govern the activation and suppression of immune responses throughout COVID-19. By analyzing immune sensing receptors and the responses initiated upon recognizing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, this review elucidates the complex pathways associated with the innate immune response in COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights for therapeutic interventions and informs public health strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

This review investigates the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2's interaction with cardiac tissue, particularly emphasizing the role of the Spike protein and ACE2 receptor in facilitating viral entry and subsequent cardiac complications. We dissect the structural features of the virus, its interactions with host cell receptors, and the resulting pathophysiological changes in the heart. Highlighting SARS-CoV-2's broad organ tropism, especially its effects on cardiomyocytes via ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the review addresses how these interactions exacerbate cardiovascular issues in patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Additionally, we assess both direct and indirect mechanisms of virus-induced cardiac damage, including myocarditis, arrhythmias, and long-term complications such as 'long COVID'. This review underscores the complexity of SARS-CoV-2's impact on the heart, emphasizing the need for ongoing research to fully understand its long-term effects on cardiovascular health.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with significant cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infection and pulmonary embolism. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the myocardium of the left ventricle and the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in deceased COVID-19 patients. We conducted a post-mortem examination on 91 individuals who succumbed to COVID-19-related complications. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the myocardium of the left ventricle was analyzed reverse transcription real time PCR (RT-qPCR) (EliGene® COVID19 UKV/SAV RT kit, Elisabeth Pharmacon), and antibody levels in serum were analyzed by serological assays (VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgM and VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgG II tests, BioMérieux). Of the heart tissue samples, 44 % tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our findings indicate that any detectable level of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 reduces the risk of viral penetration into the myocardium by more than fourfold. Specifically, individuals with detectable levels of IgG and IgM antibodies exhibited a significantly reduced presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiac tissues (p<0.0001 for IgG and p<0.001 for IgM). Notably, all patients who died from pulmonary embolism had elevated levels of IgG antibodies. The study underscores the protective role of IgG and IgM antibodies in preventing SARS-CoV-2 penetration into cardiac tissues. However, high antibody titers were associated with fatal outcomes such as pulmonary embolism, pointing to the intricate balance of immune response in COVID-19 pathology.

        <tr id="Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a global impact on millions of people's lives. Deteriorations in cellular activities induced by this lethal virus are not yet completely understood, and so its long-term consequences are unknown. There is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 and its vaccinations may have a deleterious influence on DNA damage response (DDR)-associated proteins. Objective: To investigate the status of DNA integrity in COVID-19-recovered patients and post-recovered vaccinated individuals. Methods: Blood samples were taken from 88 participants who completed questionnaires and conducted face-to-face interviews. The samples were classified into four categories based on the subjects' PCR and vaccination status: PCR negative/not vaccinated, PCR positive/not vaccinated, PCR negative/vaccinated, and PCR positive/vaccinated. ELISA kits were used to determine the expression levels of TP53BP1, Chk1, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG proteins. Results: SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly reduce Chk1 expression, but it did have a significant negative influence on TP53BP1 expression when compared to the first group. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its vaccination resulted in increased Chk1 and IgG levels, as well as a significant increase in TP53BP1 expression compared to the second group. Conclusions: Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may have a deleterious influence on DDR-associated proteins in vitro. Post-infection immunization may boost viral protection. While some studies imply that DDR effects are reversible, more research is needed to corroborate these assertions.">

        <tr id="Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Several respiratory viruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‐Coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), suppress nuclear factor‐E2‐related factor‐2 (NRF2) antioxidant response, generating oxidative stress conditions to its advantage. NRF2 has also been reported to regulate the innate immune response through the inhibition of the interferon (IFN) pathway. However, its modulation in younger individuals and its correlation with the IFN response remain to be elucidated. Methods The NRF2 and redox‐related genes expression was examined in nasopharyngeal swabs from children attending the pediatric hospital for SARS‐CoV‐2 molecular testing. Expression levels were analyzed by stratifying the population according to the SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity, age, or the presence of symptoms. The results were correlated with Types I and III IFN genes and IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs). Results We found that NRF2 expression was markedly diminished in positive patients compared to negative. Moreover, it correlated with higher expression of IFNα2 and IFNλ3, as well as ISG15 and ISG56. Interestingly, symptomatic patients with anosmia/ageusia showed pronounced expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease1/redox factor 1 (APE1), together with Type I IFNs, ISG56, and the inflammasome component NLRP3. Conclusion The results indicate an interdependence between NRF2 antioxidant pathway and IFN‐mediated response during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in young subjects.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, particularly low-density neutrophils (LDNs), are believed to contribute to acute COVID-19 severity. Here, we showed that neutrophilia can be detected acutely and even months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and mice, while neutrophil depletion reduced disease severity in mice. A key factor in neutrophilia and severe disease in infected mice was traced to the chemokine CXCL12 secreted by bone marrow cells and unexpectedly, endothelial cells. CXCL12 levels were negatively correlated with LDN numbers in longitudinal analyses of patient blood samples. CXCL12 blockade in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice increased blood/lung neutrophil numbers thereby accelerating disease progression without changing lung virus titers. The exaggerated mortality caused by CXCL12 blockade can be reversed by neutrophil depletion. In addition, blocking interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) reduced CXCL12 levels, suggesting a signal transduction from virus-mediated ACE2 ligation to increased CXCL12 secretion. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of CXCL12 in diminishing neutrophilia, including low density neutrophilia, and its deleterious effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results also support the involvement of SARS-CoV-2-endothelial cell interactions in viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the worst pandemics in human history. The causative virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can invade host cells in multiple organs by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II expressed on the cell surface. Once inside the host cell, viral replication takes place, leading to cellular disruption and the release of signal molecules that are recognised by the innate immune system. Innate immunity activation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and primes the adaptive immune system. The proinflammatory environment defends against further viral entry and replication. SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to lead to myocardial injury through several mechanisms. Firstly, direct viral-mediated cellular invasion of cardiomyocytes has been shown in in vitro and histological studies, which is related to cellular injury. Secondly, the proinflammatory state during COVID-19 can lead to myocardial injury and the release of protein remnants of the cardiac contractile machinery. Thirdly, the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is associated with thromboembolism of coronary arteries and/or other vascular systems. COVID-19 patients can also develop heart failure; however, the underlying mechanism is much less well-characterised than for myocardial injury. Several questions remain regarding COVID-19-related heart failure, including its potential reversibility, the role of anti-viral medications in its prevention, and the mechanisms underlying heart failure pathogenesis in long COVID-19. Further work is required to improve our understanding of the mechanism of cardiac sequelae in COVID-19, which may enable us to target SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients against longer-lasting cardiovascular complications.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are critical human pathogens that continually expand to naïve populations and for which there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain.">

        <tr id="Monocytes and macrophages, as important constituents of the innate immune system, are equipped with multiple Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) to recognize invading pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, and mount an antiviral response. Nevertheless, their uncontrolled activation can lead to hyperinflammation seen in severe COVID-19. Surprisingly, we observed that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins triggered only a weak proinflammatory response in human peripheral blood monocytes. By employing THP-1 and Jurkat NF-κB::eGFP reporter cell lines expressing specific TLRs, various TLR ligands and blocking antibodies, we determined that surface TLRs, including TLR2/1, TLR2/6 and TLR4 do not play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 sensing. However, monocytes are potently activated by the replication-competent SARS-CoV-2, and the response correlates with the viral uptake that is observed only in monocytes, but not in lymphocytes. We show that monocyte activation involves two distinct steps. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 infects monocytes in a process independent of the S protein and the prime SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Instead, the alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor CD147, which is highly expressed on monocytes, recognizes its well-known interaction partners cyclophilins A and B that are incorporated into SARS-CoV-2 virions. Secondly, upon viral uptake via the cyclophilin-CD147 interaction, that can be inhibited by specific CD147 blocking antibodies or competition with recombinant human cyclophilin A and B, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recognized by TLR7/8 in endosomes, leading to upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, comprising the core hyperinflammatory signature. Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism how human monocytes sense SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting the cyclophilin-CD147 axis might be beneficial to alleviate overt myeloid-driven inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the respiratory system and other organ systems. Tissue injuries resulting from viral infection and host hyperinflammatory responses may lead to moderate to severe pneumonia, systemic complications, and even death. While anti-inflammatory agents have been used to treat patients with severe COVID-19, their therapeutic effects are limited. GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) is a pro-inflammatory receptor expressed on vascular endothelial cells, regulating leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a GPR4 antagonist, NE-52-QQ57, in the SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Our results demonstrated that GPR4 antagonist treatment increased the survival rate in this severe COVID-19 mouse model. The inflammatory response, characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was reduced in the GPR4 antagonist group compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, both SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and infectious viral titers in the mouse lung were decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive mouse brains was also decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, the GPR4 antagonist inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero E6 cells. Together, these results suggest that GPR4 antagonism may be explored as a novel approach for the treatment of COVID-19 and other similar viral diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis is a rare but serious complication of COVID-19. The host response correlates of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis remain unclear, thereby limiting therapeutic development. We therefore performed proteomic and transcriptomic phenotyping of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis in Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries. We included a bioenergetics focus given the emerging role of mitochondrial function in enteroviral myocarditis. Early (<30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). Values are log10 transformed, and p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons across the full twenty biomarkers (six shown here; * indicates a p-value < 0.05). CRP = C-Reactive Protein; IFNG = Interferon Gamma ; PCT= Procalcitonin; TNFR1 = Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1; DDIMER = D-dimer; and IL1RA = Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Methods We previously adjudicated five unvaccinated pre-Delta SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis cases among 5265 MHS beneficiaries who enrolled into the EPICC study with COVID-19; four of these cases had blood collected. We matched myocarditis cases 1:10 with sex, age, comorbidity, and blood sampling-time matched controls (SARS-CoV-2 infection with no myocarditis) from the EPICC study. Cases and controls underwent comparison of early (< 30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay (with multiplicity adjustment). We also performed early whole blood transcriptomic sequencing with DESeq2 and GSEA analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways, including mitochondrial (mtDNA) regulated innate immune pathways (with FDR for multiple comparisons). Gene set enrichment analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). FDR = False Discovery Rate; NES = Normalized enrichment score. Results We detected higher post-infection Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (TNFR1) and procalcitonin (PCT) plasma concentrations in myocarditis cases versus matched controls (TNFR1: 0.33 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.032; PCT: 0.59 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.02) (Fig 1). We noted no statistically significant difference in the 18 other proteomic markers tested. GSEA analysis noted upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS pathway genes, and downregulated mtDNA innate immune genes, in cases versus controls (FDR < 0.05) (Fig 2). Conclusion In this MHS study, SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis was associated with elevation of TNFR1 and PCT secretion, upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS gene expression, and downregulated mtDNA innate immunity. While constrained by small sample sizes of a rare complication, these biomarker associations prompt mechanistic studies which may direct development of therapies for myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other respiratory viral pathogens.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has profoundly impacted global health, with pneumonia emerging as a major complication in severe cases. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is marked by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an excessive inflammatory response, resulting in oxidative stress and significant tissue damage, particularly in the respiratory system. Antioxidants have garnered considerable attention for their potential role in managing COVID-19 pneumonia by mitigating oxidative stress and modulating immune responses. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the use of antioxidants in hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Studies exploring antioxidants, including vitamins, trace elements, nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O3), glutathione (GSH), L-carnitine, melatonin, bromelain, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and numerous polyphenols, have yielded promising outcomes. Through their ROS-scavenging properties, these molecules support endothelial function, reduce the thrombosis risk, and may help mitigate the effects of the cytokine storm, a key contributor to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Clinical evidence suggests that antioxidant supplementation may improve patient outcomes by decreasing inflammation, supporting immune cell function, and potentially shortening recovery times. Furthermore, these molecules may mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19 by exerting direct antiviral effects that inhibit the infection process and genomic replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. Moreover, antioxidants may work synergistically with standard antiviral treatments to reduce viral-induced oxidative damage. By integrating findings from the literature with real-world data from our clinical experience, we gain a more profound understanding of the role of antioxidants in managing COVID-19 pneumonia. Further research combining comprehensive literature reviews with real-world data analysis is crucial to validate the efficacy of antioxidants and establish evidence-based guidelines for their use in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Coronaviruses are endemic in the human population and include both seasonal viruses as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), with exposure history differing between children and adults. We sought to identify age-specific differences in memory CD4 T cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), as quantitative and qualitative differences in immune function may be responsible for age-related variation in disease presentation. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from cohorts of children and adults enrolled pre-2019 and following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Subjects enrolled post-pandemic had a history of COVID-19 vaccination. Cells were stimulated with peptide pools representing the unique and more cross-reactive portions of the S protein for 24 hours, with cytokine release blocked for the last 4 hours of coculture. Subsets of S-specific CD4 T cells were identified using a 31-plex spectral flow cytometry panel. Results Pre-pandemic, adults had a higher frequency of activated IFNγ+ CD4 T cells specific for the S protein compared to children, with boosting of responses in both adults and children following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, the CD4 T cell response to the S protein was Th1 biased, with adults having a greater proportion of cells expressing IFNγ, IL2 and TNFα. When cytokine-expressing, antigen-specific CD4 T cells were subsetted by CD45RA and CCR7 expression, there was a more naïve phenotype pre-pandemic, with transition to an effector memory phenotype post-2019. Conclusion A greater magnitude of CD4 T cells specific for the S protein was detected in adults pre-pandemic, with this reactivity boosted in both children and adults following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Boosting of reactivity to both unique and conserved S protein epitopes in children and adults suggested that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via vaccination did not preferentially boost memory CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes. Post-pandemic, there was a shift to a more Th1 phenotype together with a gain in cytokine-producing CD4 T cells with a phenotype consistent with effector memory. Disclosures Jennifer L.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and -2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) that have caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, a better understanding of host responses to β-CoVs would provide insights into the pathogenesis of these viruses to identify potential targets for medical countermeasures. In this study, our objective is to use a systems biology approach to explore the magnitude and scope of innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection over time in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3/2B4 cells). Total RNA extracted at 12, 24, and 48 hours after β-CoVs or mock infection of Calu-3/2B4 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis to select genes whose expressions were significantly modulated post-infection. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 stimulate similar yet distinct innate antiviral signaling pathways in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that many genes related to the viral life cycle, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated at multiple time points. Based on their profound modulation upon infection by SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron BA.1, four ISGs, i.e., bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 11 (CXCL11), and Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1), were identified as potential drug targets against β-CoVs. Our findings suggest that these genes affect both pathogens directly and indirectly through the innate immune response, making them potential targets for host-directed antivirals. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induce differential effects on host innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immunocompromised patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often have prolonged viral shedding, and some are clinically suspected of reinfection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, data on this issue are limited. This study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 variants in serially collected respiratory samples from immunocompromised patients with prolonged viral shedding for over 12 weeks or relapsed viral shedding after at least 2 weeks of viral clearance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
From February 2022 to September 2023, we prospectively enrolled immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had hematologic malignancies or had undergone transplantation and were admitted to a tertiary hospital. Weekly saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from enrolled patients for at least 12 weeks after diagnosis. Genomic RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on samples, and those testing positive underwent viral culture to isolate the live virus. Spike gene full sequencing via Sanger sequencing and real-time reverse transcription-PCR for detecting mutation genes were conducted to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants.


RESULTS
Among 116 enrolled patients, 20 with prolonged or relapsed viral shedding were screened to identify the variants. Of these 20 patients, 7 (35%) exhibited evidence of re-infection; one of 8 patients with prolonged viral shedding and 6 of 12 with relapsed viral shedding were reinfected with SARS-CoV-2.


CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that approximately one-third of immunocompromised patients with persistent or relapsed viral shedding had reinfection with different variants of SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected human health, yet the mechanisms underlying its impact on metabolic and vascular systems remain incompletely understood. Clinical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 directly disrupts vascular homeostasis, with perfusion abnormalities observed in various tissues. The pancreatic islet, a key endocrine mini-organ reliant on its microvasculature for optimal function, may be particularly vulnerable. Studies have proposed a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and islet dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated how SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein affects human islet microvascular function. Using confocal microscopy and living pancreas slices from non-diabetic organ donors, we show that a SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 recombinant protein activates pericytes - key regulators of islet capillary diameter and beta cell function-and induces capillary constriction. These effects are driven by a loss of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from pericytes' plasma membrane, impairing ACE2 activity and increasing local angiotensin II levels. Our findings highlight islet pericyte dysfunction as a potential contributor to the diabetogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and offer new insights into the mechanisms linking COVID-19, vascular dysfunction and diabetes.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with neurological effects that persist beyond the acute phase, collectively referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or “long COVID.” This article discusses the neurological impacts of PASC, which can occur regardless of the initial illness’s severity. Studies indicate that most patients continue to experience symptoms for at least 3 months post-infection. Long-term effects include neurocognitive deficits, sleep disturbances, and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. Proposed mechanisms underlying these effects include neuroinflammation, microvascular damage, and autoimmune responses, while direct viral neuroinvasion remains a topic of ongoing debate. SARS-CoV-2 may also worsen pre-existing neurological disorders and increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease. The article highlights the need for longitudinal studies to better understand the variability in outcomes and the mechanisms driving these persistent effects. In addition, it explores the inflammatory pathways linking long COVID to AD. Both conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation, activation of shared markers such as the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome, and alterations in amyloid-beta production. The apolipoprotein E4 gene, a known risk factor for AD, is also associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. Neuroimaging studies reveal brain changes in COVID-19 survivors, particularly in regions related to cognition and memory, further emphasizing the need for long-term research to assess the potential role of long COVID in exacerbating neurodegenerative diseases.">

 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. However, SARS-CoV-2 chiefly infects lungs through the binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) expressed on the alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, the intestinal epithelial cells also express ACE2 receptors. Not only has the SARS-CoV-2 been detected in nasopharyngeal and mid-nasal samples, but also it seems SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found in the feces of infectious patients. In fact, fecal samples of patients contain RNA of the virus. The intensity of COVID-19 has mainly been associated with aging and comorbidities. Older patients experience a decline in the alteration of the gut microbiome, and COVID-19 has proven to be most fatal in this age group, further emphasizing the potential critical role of gut microbiota in this disease. The lung was formerly believed to be a sterile area free from bacteria. However, the lung microbiome has received more attention due to its recent link to several respiratory illnesses and immunity. In this review article, data from COVID-19 research and gut–lung cross-talk in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease and explored the bidirectional impacts of it on the gut–lung axis microbiome were discussed.

        <tr id="We have previously shown that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1E2 envelope glycoprotein can regulate HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) activity through disruption to NF-κB activation. This response is associated with upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S, M, and E but not the N structural protein can perform similar downmodulation of HIV-1 LTR activation, and in a dose-dependent manner, in both HEK293 and lung BEAS-2B cell lines. This effect is highest with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S strain and decreases over time for the subsequent emerging variants of concern (VOC), with Omicron providing the weakest effect. We developed pseudo-typed viral particle (PVP) viral tools that allowed for the generation of cell lines constitutively expressing the four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and utilising the VSV-g envelope protein to deliver the integrated gene construct. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed on cells expressing S, E, M, or N to determine cell activation status. Gene expression differences were found in a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IF16, IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15, as well as for a number of heat shock protein (HSP) genes, including HSPH1, HSPA6, and HSPBP1, with all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. There were also differences observed in expression patterns of transcription factors, with both SP1 and MAVS upregulated in the presence of S, M, and E but not the N protein. Collectively, the results indicate that gene expression patterns associated with ER stress pathways can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein expression. The results suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate an array of cell pathways, resulting in disruption to NF-κB signalling, hence providing alterations to multiple physiological responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.">

We aimed to uncover spatial immune‐related protein changes in SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis compared with CHI placentas and uncomplicated pregnancies to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Placentas were retrospectively collected from cases with SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis resulting in fetal distress/demise (n = 9), CHI (n = 9), and uncomplicated term controls (n = 9). The expression of 53 immune‐related proteins was quantified using GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler in three separate compartments: villi (fetal compartment), intervillous space, and decidua (both maternal compartments). Compared with controls, SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis and CHI both displayed differentially expressed proteins in the intervillous space only, including upregulation of myeloid markers (e.g., CD40, CD11c, CD68, CD163). Specifically, SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis was associated with reduced expression of multiple apoptotic proteins (e.g., BAD, BIM, BLXL, BCL6). In conclusion, SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis and CHI are associated with enhanced myeloid cell infiltration into the intervillous space, but not in the decidua and villi. The more prominently reduced apoptosis‐related protein expression in SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis may lead to an exaggerated immune response, causing acute placental dysfunction and fetal demise.">

        <tr id="Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is an uncontrolled plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow, leading to immune dysregulation with impaired humoral immune responses. Conversely, cellular-based responses play a vital role in MM patients. However, the extent and duration of cellular-induced protection remain unclear to date. Here, immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) like Lenalidomide (Lena) become interesting, as they may have stimulatory effects on T-cell functioning. Methods In this study we investigated immune responses elicited by COVID-19 vaccine or infection comparing 43 healthy volunteers (avg. 35y, 72.1% female, 81.4% previously COVID-19 infected), with 41 MM patients under Lena maintenance therapy (avg. 63.8y, 51.2% female, 61% previously COVID-19 infected). Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), spike-RBD, and nucleocapsid (N) were measured via ELISA in subjects’ plasma. Freshly isolated PBMCs, incubated with SARS-CoV-2 peptides (N, S), activation induced marker (AIM) assays and flow cytometry, allowed us to assess cellular responses (CD8+ T, T(F)H: CD4+ T (follicular) helper). Results Whereas healthy controls showed significant better humoral responses (N IgA p<0.001), T cell responses were robust in the MM group (higher S-act. TH, p<0.001). Stratified by COVID-19 status, the MM group showed higher N-act. TH (p=0.03). These results were unchanged comparing a Lena intake with Lena break around vaccination. Discussion Taken together, MM patients under Lena therapy exhibit weakened antibody production but present a robust T cell response following SARS-COV-2 infection or vaccination. Our results highlight the importance of vaccination in this subgroup and moreover, argue against a Lena intake break around the time of vaccination.">

        <tr id="Gap junction intercellular communication, particularly involving Connexin 43 and Connexin 47, plays a critical role in maintaining CNS homeostasis and has been implicated in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) pathology. Thus, warranting further studies in experimental animal models to understand how modulation of Cx43 expression can influence MS pathology. Intracranial infection with murine-β-coronavirus Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) in mice results in acute pathology characterized by high viral titers, glial activation in the brain and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination, effectively mimicking key pathological hallmarks of MS and serving as a robust model to investigate its viral etiology. MHV-A59 infection leads to a pronounced downregulation of Cx43 during the acute phase, emphasizing its critical role in virus-induced CNS pathology. In this study, we investigated the potential of in vivo 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) administration in modulating Cx43 expression in this MHV-induced model and its consequence on chronic virus-induced demyelination. Our results reveal that 4-PBA treatment reduced acute MHV-A59 infectivity and viral spread in the brain while modulating the glial cell response, mounting host immunity. Treatment with 4-PBA effectively preserved the expression of both Cx43 and Cx47 in infected CNS cells, counteracting their infection-induced downregulation. Furthermore, MHV-A59 infection downregulated the expression of ER-resident thioredoxin family protein (ERp29), a well-known molecular chaperone of Cx43, which was rescued by 4-PBA treatment. We further validated if such downregulation of ERp29 is also evident in MS demyelinating plaques. In human MS patient-derived brain tissue, reduced Cx43 and ERp29 staining was observed in demyelinating plaques. Our studies revealed that 4-PBA treatment not only limits viral replication and spread throughout the brain but also protects the mice against severe chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination. These findings suggest that targeting Cx43 with 4-PBA holds significant therapeutic potential for addressing virus-induced neuroinflammatory demyelination and MS by preserving gap junction intercellular communication.">

Here, we show the strong association of protective cellular immunity with mild COVID-19 and unique cell types against SARS-CoV-2 virus in an HLA-A2 restricted manner. ELISpot assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in mild COVID-19 patients are significantly higher than in severe patients, whereas neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 virus significantly correlate with disease severity. Single-cell analyses of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells, which recognize highly conserved immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes, demonstrate divergent profiles in unvaccinated patients with mild versus severe disease. CD8+ T-cell types including cytotoxic KLRB1+ CD8αα cells with innate-like T-cell signatures, IFNGhiID3hi memory cells and IL7R+ proliferative stem cell-like memory cells are preferentially observed in mild COVID-19, whereas distinct terminally-differentiated T-cell subsets are predominantly detected in severe COVID-19: highly activated FASLhi T-cell subsets and early-terminated or dysfunctional IL4R+ GATA3+ stem cell-like memory T-cell subset.

        <tr id="Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus persists in multiple organs due to its tropism for various tissues, including the skeletal system. This study investigates the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including both ancestral and Omicron viral strains, on differentiating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the precursor cells, into osteoblasts. Although both viral strains can productively infect osteoblasts, precursor cell infection remained abortive. Viral exposure during osteoblast differentiation demonstrates that both variants inhibit mineral and organic matrix deposition. This is accompanied by reduced expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the upregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) strongly suggests that the ancestral and Omicron variants may disrupt bone homeostasis by promoting osteoclast differentiation, ultimately leading to the formation of bone-resorbing cells. This process is dependent of spike glycoprotein since its neutralization significantly reduced the effect of infective SARS-CoV-2 and UV-C inactivated virus. This study underscores the capacity of ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants to disrupt osteoblast differentiation, a process essential for preserving the homeostasis and functionality of bone tissue.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has challenged the scientific and medical community since its emergence. Understanding the immunopathogenic events that occur during infection is crucial to developing effective treatment and prevention strategies.Objective: To synthesize the immunological aspects in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019.Development: SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the entry of the virus into host cells through the ACE2 receptor. Once inside, the virus induces an immune response. In the early stages, the innate immune response is activated, which includes the release of interferons and cytokines. However, in some patients, this response becomes deregulated, triggering a cytokine storm that contributes to systemic inflammation and lung damage. T and B cells also play a crucial role; although the activation of CD8+ T cells can help control the infection, their depletion in severe cases has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Immunopathogenic events in COVID-19 are complex and can lead to diverse clinical outcomes. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for the development of targeted therapies and effective vaccines. Continued research is critical to improving our response to future pandemics.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The global pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 has resulted in millions of people experiencing long COVID condition, a range of persistent symptoms following the acute phase, with an estimated prevalence of 27%–64%. Materials and Methods To understand its pathophysiology, we conducted a longitudinal study on viral load and cytokine dynamics in individuals with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We used reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR to quantify viral RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and employed multiplex technology to measure plasma cytokine levels in a cohort of people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Our study included individuals with long COVID condition and those without, all of whom had at least three nasopharyngeal and plasma samples collected within 55 days after diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results Individuals affected with long COVID symptoms had delayed viral clearance and lower viral loads at diagnosis compared to those without symptoms. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed variations in IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10 levels, with delayed normalization in individuals affected by long COVID syndrome. Correlation analysis indicated associations between viral load and IP‐10 and interrelations among cytokines IL‐1β, IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10. Conclusion Our study provides insights into the association between nasopharyngeal viral load, cytokine dynamics, and the development of long COVID syndrome, providing an early signature of this condition.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has presented multifaceted health challenges. COVID-19 primarily targets the respiratory system but also affects multiple organ systems, including the endocrine system. Emerging evidence suggests interactions between thyroid function, the acute phase of COVID-19, and the prolonged symptoms known as post-COVID sequalae or long COVID. Several studies have reported that COVID-19 can induce thyroid dysfunction, leading to conditions such as thyroiditis and alterations in thyroid hormone levels. The mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 affects the thyroid include direct viral infection of thyroid cells, leading to viral thyroiditis, which causes inflammation and transient or sustained thyroid dysfunction, as well as an excessive systemic immune response (cytokine storm). This is associated with elevated levels of cytokines, such as IL-6, that disrupt thyroid function and lead to nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). Medications administered during the acute illness phase, such as corticosteroids and antiviral drugs, can also impact thyroid hormone actions. The involvement of the thyroid gland in long COVID, or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, is an area not well defined, with potential implications for understanding and managing this condition. Persistent low-grade inflammation affecting thyroid function over time can lead to ongoing thyroiditis or exacerbate pre-existing thyroid conditions. Viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, can trigger or worsen autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’ disease. Long COVID may disrupt the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, which can, in turn, affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, leading to abnormal thyroid function. This review was designed to systematically capture recent literature on COVID-19-related thyroid dysfunction in the adult population, the prognostic consequences of thyroid dysfunction during COVID-19, and the effects of thyroid dysfunction on patients with long COVID. A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE databases was conducted.

Apparently, coronavirus infection has become a seasonal respiratory viral infection. Among the problems remaining after the end of the pandemic, one of the leading places is occupied by post-Covid syndrome - a condition associated with the persistence of symptoms of COVID-19 or the reappearance of symptoms 3 months after the illness. Most common post-Covid syndrome features are: immune dysregulation, viral persistence, continued systemic inflammation, autoimmune dysorders, tromboses and endothelial damage, myocarditis, ischemic cardial disease, lung fibrosis. These different organ dysfunctions are accompanied by neurological complications. Precise post-Covid syndrome pathophysiological mechanisms are to be discovered.

        <tr id="Introduction The innate immune response is an important first checkpoint in the evolution of an infection. Although adaptive immunity is generally considered the immune component that retains antigenic memory, innate immune responses can also be affected by previous stimulations. This study evaluated the impact of vaccination on innate cell activation by TLR7/8 agonist R848, as well as seasonal variations. Methods To this end, blood samples from a cohort of 304 food and retail workers from the Quebec City region were collected during three visits at 12-week intervals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils were isolated during the first and third visits and were stimulated with R848 to assess the innate immune response. Results Our results show that IL-8 production after stimulation decreased after vaccination. In addition, the IL-8 response was significantly different depending on the season when the visit occurred, for both COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Discussion This study highlights that innate immune responses can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and fluctuate seasonally.">

 Introduction:
 SARS-CoV-2 causes various neurological sequelae in COVID-19 survivors including fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19 illness, is also a major risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Clinical evidence suggests that reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a likely pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, and eNOS levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD . We hypothesize that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) deficiency contributes to brain endothelial dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and that SARS-CoV-2 infection accelerates the onset of VaD in eNOS-deficient mice.


 Methods:
 6-month-old eNOS+/- (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and WT male mice were infected with 1X10
 4
 -pfu mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2 intranasally, and animals were evaluated acutely out to 3-days-postinfection (3dpi) for changes in body weight and clinical signs of illness. Viral copy numbers and nuclear capsid were also quantified in lung and brain. Quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence were used to analyze markers of brain inflammation and senescence.


 Results:
 eNOS+/- infected mice exhibited more disease-associated weight loss (~15%) than WT-infected mice (~5 %). While infected WT and eNOS+/- had comparable pulmonary viral load, neither had detectable virus in the brain. Quantitative PCR analysis of whole brain-isolated mRNA showed increases in multiple proinflammatory mediators such as CCL2 and IL-6 and senescence markers such as p53 and p21 (eNOS
 +/-
 >> WT). Similarly, immunofluorescent analysis showed increased Iba1 (microglia marker) fluorescent intensity in the cortex of infected mice (eNOS
 +/-
 >> WT).


 Conclusions:
 eNOS+/- deficiency, a clinically relevant model of VaD, worsens acute SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity, neuroinflammation and markers of brain senescence despite comparable pulmonary viral load (to WT-infected animals) and absence of virus in the brain. While the potential effects of SARS-COV-2 on cognitive decline in this model will be assessed in future studies, this is the first experimental evidence demonstrating a link between eNOS and neuropathology associated with COVID-19.

Cellular senescence has been implicated as a key pathogenic mechanism. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of regorafenib, a previously characterized senomorphic drug, for severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected K18-hACE2 mice, overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor, exhibited 100% mortality by 10 days post infection. Regorafenib treatment significantly improved survival rates, approximately 43% remaining alive. Mechanistically, regorafenib effectively suppressed type I and II interferon and cytokine signaling. Notably, regorafenib inhibited NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, a key driver of the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of regorafenib and suggest its potential use as a promising treatment option for severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 are still active in the population. Some patients remained PCR-positive for more than 4 weeks, called “persistently PCR-positive”. Recent evidence suggests a link between the gut microbiota and susceptibility to COVID-19, although no studies have explored persistent PCR conditions. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between persistent positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, the gut microbiome, and individual host determinants. Methods A shotgun metagenomic analysis was conducted on fecal samples from 28 individuals affected by COVID-19. Patients were divided into two groups: those who had cleared the virus within 30 days (designated as the control group) (n = 15), and those who remained PCR-positive beyond 30 days (called the PCR+ group) (n = 13). We also investigated the correlation between prolonged viral clearance and several additional factors, including clinical parameters, immune responses, microbial metabolites, and dietary habits. Results The composition and functionality of the microbiome varied based on the duration of positivity as determined by PCR. Compared to the control group, the persistent PCR+ group exhibited elevated pathogen levels and augmented diversity in functional gene families (p-value < 0.05). A multi-omics analysis integrating metagenomics, metabolites, and metadata also revealed the specific contribution of certain blood markers in this group, including basophils, IgM, IgG (both general and specific for SARS-CoV-2), and markers of liver damage. Unhealthy diet was identified as a significant factor influencing the duration of PCR positivity. Conclusions These findings indicate that the gut microbiome may play a role in delayed viral clearance and persistent positive RT-PCR results. Our study also contributes to the understanding of the role of host factors as mediators linking the gut microbiota and disease outcomes. Further large-scale studies must confirm these data; however, they suggest the relevance of monitoring microbiome changes in the early post-viral years to control SARS-CoV-2 and providing individual healthcare support.">

        <tr id="Introduction. In present, the medical community continues to study the impact of coronavirus infection on various organs and systems of the body. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes multifaceted pathological processes and, among other things, affects the cells of the circulatory system. Objective: To assess the degree of DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Material and methods. 200 patients took part in the study. The control group consisted of conditionally healthy individuals matched by gender and age (n=50). The degree of DNA damage was assessed using the DNA comet assay in an alkaline medium. The assessment parameters included: tail length (TL) (pc), percentage of damaged DNA in the tail (Tail DNA, %), tail moment (conventional units) and Olive moment (conventional units). Results. The average values of the parameters of comet DNA of patients in the acute period of coronavirus infection were: TL 95.18±5.7 pc, percentage of damaged DNA in the tail (Tail DNA%) 70.82±7.12%, tail moment 68.52±8.58 conventional units, Olive moment 41.11±4.46 conventional units. When comparing the parameters of comet DNA of lymphocytes of conditionally healthy individuals and patients in the acute period of coronavirus infection associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a significant increase (p < 0.001) in these parameters is noted, which indicates an increase in the content of fragmented and damaged DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes in sick individuals.

        <tr id="In the past decade, a major goal in biomedical research has been to understand why individuals differ in disease susceptibility, disease dynamics, and progression. In many pathologies, this variability stems from evolved immune mechanisms that resist inflammatory stress from various diseases that have been encountered throughout life. These may provide advantages against other diseases, reduce comorbidities, and enhance longevity. This study evaluates prior immunity as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, crucial for understanding plasmatic signaling cascades in different disease stages and their impact on disease progression. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, primarily affects the respiratory system and presents a wide range of symptoms, posing significant challenges to medicine. This study systematically analyzed prior immunity and inflammation in two independent cohorts of infected patients. A serological profile is determined by protein microarrays, which identify IgM and IgG responses against 37 prevalent microbial pathogens and provide a comprehensive plasma analysis of 21 acute-phase proteins. Our results reveal distinct serological profiles correlating with disease severity, indicating that immune system dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is linked to existing immunity. These findings highlight the relevance of prior immunity for monitoring disease progression, particularly in infections and vaccine failure, and underscore the importance of functional proteomics in determining prognostic biomarkers.">

Neurological symptoms include anxiety, depression and impaired short-term memory. However, the exact underlying mechanisms of long Covid are not yet decrypted. Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid.

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells are associated with viral clearance and improved outcomes in COVID-19, but also with immunopathology. Defining T cell diversity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables implementation of T cells in prevention and treatment strategies. T cells recognize peptide sequences from pathogens upon presentation in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Human MHC molecule diversity results in a wide array of peptide recognition by T cells making viral escape difficult, but also challenging to measure. Methods Using the ImmunoSEQ Assay to sequence complementarity-determining regions in the β chains (CDR3β) of the T cell receptor (TCR) from peripheral blood collected from participants in the EPICC COVID-19 cohort study, we quantified and characterized patterns of TCR usage. Multiple bioinformatic pipelines were compared for analysis. Results Our study evaluated TCR repertoires from 39 participants who had mild (20 outpatient) versus severe (19 hospitalized) acute COVID-19, and either experienced unvaccinated primary infection (n = 15) or vaccine breakthrough infection (n = 24) (Table 1). From these four clinical groups, we used the ImmuneCODE database, VDJdatabase and healthy controls to identify CD8 TCR sequences and amino acid motifs in the CDR3β region specific for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We were surprised to find that vaccine breakthrough and primary infection participants exhibited similar frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR sequences over 14-21 days post-symptom onset. Increased use of common TCR clones occurred in participants with older age and comorbidities, which correlated with more severe disease (Figure 1). Strikingly, an increased frequency of non-SARS-CoV-2 TCRs was significantly associated with severe disease in unvaccinated (p = 0.006) and vaccinated participants (p = 0.045). Conclusion In conclusion, our study highlights the opportunities and challenges of studying the complexity of T cell diversity and the utility of combining databases and bioinformatics for identification of patterns of TCR recognition. Interestingly, participants who were hospitalized were more likely to have circulating T cells non-specific for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that vaccines that increase T cell specificity may reduce disease severity.

        <tr id="Introduction Upon infection, T cell-driven B cell responses in GC reactions induce memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells that secrete protective antibodies. How formation of specifically long-lived plasma cells is regulated via the interplay between specific B and CD4+ T cells is not well understood. Generally, antibody levels decline over time after clearance of the primary infection. Method In this study, convalescent individuals with stable RBD antibody levels (n=14, “sustainers”) were compared with donors (n=13) with the greatest antibody decline from a cohort of 132. To investigate the role of the cellular immune compartment in the maintenance of antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific responses at 4 to 6 weeks post-mild COVID-19 infection were characterized using deep immune profiling. Results Both groups had similar frequencies of total SARS-CoV-2-specific B and CD4+ T cells. Sustainers had fewer Spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells early after infection and increased neutralizing capacity of RBD antibodies over time, unlike the declining group. However, declining IgG titers correlated with lower frequency of Spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Conclusion These data suggest that “sustainers” have unique dynamics of GC reactions, yield different outputs of terminally differentiating cells, and improve the quality of protective antibodies over time.

        <tr id="Alcohol-induced dysregulation of microglial activity is associated with neuroinflammation, cognitive decline, heightened risk for neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol dependence, and escalation of alcohol drinking. Given the challenge of longitudinally sampling primary microglia, we optimized an in vitro method to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-human primates (NHP) into microglia-like cells (induced-microglia; iMGL). The iMGLs displayed transcriptional profiles distinct from those of monocyte progenitors and closely resembling those of primary microglia. Notably, morphological features showed that differentiated iMGLs derived from NHPs with chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) possessed a more mature-like microglial morphology. Additionally, dysregulation in key inflammatory and regulatory markers alongside increased baseline phagocytic activity was observed in CAC-derived IMGLs in the resting state. Phenotypic and functional assessments following LPS stimulation indicated the presence of an immune-tolerant phenotype and enrichment of a CD86+ hyper-inflammatory subpopulation in iMGLs derived from ethanol-exposed animals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vitro differentiation of PBMC offers a minimally invasive approach to studying the impact of CAC on microglial function revealing that CAC reshapes both functional and transcriptional profiles of microglia.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2, also called coronavirus causes SARS-CoV-2 or severe acute respir-atory syndrome, a highly transmissible disease that has rapidly spread worldwide, straining healthcare systems and leading to a substantial number of fatalities. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has revealed a gender difference, with males dying at a greater rate and with more severe cases than women. It's worth noting that the male reproductive system might be par-ticularly susceptible to damage during periods of moderate to severe sickness, which has been linked to cases of orchitis and erectile dysfunction. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles have been found in the tissues of the testes and penile of both living patients who have recov-ered from the virus and in post-mortem analyses of males who have died from it. For males who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2, sexual transmission is not a big concern, even though moderate to severe infections may have detrimental effects on male reproductive health. This includes the depletion of germ cells and Leydig cells that leads to a decrease in the formation of sperm, potentially decreasing the release of male sex hormones. These ad-verse effects may result in issues such as infertility and sexual dysfunction, which are of growing concern for couples looking to conceive or those in need of assisted reproduction. Numerous investigations have examined SARS-CoV-2's effects on male reproductive health from a variety of perspectives. The purpose of this review is to give a general summary of how SARS-CoV-2 has affected male reproductive health.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Problem Although it is still uncertain whether Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) placental infection and vertical transmission occur, inflammation during early pregnancy can have devastating consequences for gestation itself and the growing fetus. If and how SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific immune cells negatively affect placenta functionality is still unknown. Method of study We stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from women of reproductive age with SARS‐CoV‐2 peptides and cocultured them with trophoblast spheroids (HTR‐8/SVneo and JEG‐3) to dissect if SARS‐CoV‐2‐activated immune cells can interfere with trophoblast functionality. The activation and cytokine profile of the PBMCs were determined using multicolor flow cytometry. The functionality of trophoblast spheroids was assessed using microscopy, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and RT‐qPCR. Results SARS‐CoV‐2 S and M peptides significantly activated PBMCs (monocytes, NK cells, and T cells with memory subsets) and induced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFNγ. The activated PBMCs did not impact the viability, growth rate, and invasion capabilities of trophoblast spheroids. Furthermore, the hormonal production of hCG by JEG‐3 spheroids was not compromised upon coculture with the activated PBMCs. mRNA transcript levels of genes involved in trophoblast spheroid functional pathways were also not dysregulated after coculture. Conclusions Together, the findings of our in vitro coculture model, although not fully representative of in vivo conditions, strongly support the claim that the interaction of SARS‐CoV‐2‐activated peripheral blood immune cells with trophoblast cells at the fetal–maternal interface does not negatively affect trophoblast functionality. This goes in hand with the recommendation of vaccinating pregnant women in their first trimester.">

        <tr id="The persistence or emergence of long-term symptoms following resolution of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). PASC predominantly affects the cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune systems. Among these, the central nervous system (CNS) is significantly impacted, leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, brain fog, cognitive impairment, anosmia, hypogeusia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy (neuro-PASC). However, the risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms responsible for neuro-PASC remain unclear. This review hypothesis discusses the leading hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in long COVID/PASC, focusing on neuro-PASC. We propose vascular dysfunction mediated by activation of astrocytes and pericytes followed by blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological manifestations. Additionally, we provide insights into the role of spike protein at the blood–brain interface. Finally, we explore the potential pathogenic mechanisms initiated by the interaction between the spike protein and cellular receptors at the brain endothelial and tissue levels.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and nearly 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system.Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 model. (A) Experimental diagram: Eight weeks-old K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, monitored daily for symptoms, or euthanized at 5 days post-infection (DPI) to collect tissue. (B) Daily weight measurements in K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020.

(D) Representative mouse brain hemisphere image showing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by immunohistochemical staining. Boxed regions are shown on the right. Bar: 500 µm. Methods Here using the K18-hACE2 model, we investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on major parts of neurovascular systems, and found increased incidence of microhemorrhage and significant disruption of both BBB and BCSFB in K18-hACE2 mice after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cerebral microvascular injury was accompanied by substantial pericyte damage, tight junction loss, astrogliosis, and neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma. In addition, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation occurred at both BBB and BCSFB, as shown by upregulation of VCAM-1 and COX2 markers.Figure 2: Vascular damage and BBB breakdown in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 model.

Results By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment.

Conclusion The impact of such changes, together with astrogliosis and neuroinflammation, may drive or at least contribute to the neurological complications seen in COVID-19 patients. As SARS-CoV-2 will likely remain a major health issue for years to come, our findings provide a needed understanding of its impact on the major CNS barriers and brain homeostasis at both molecular and cellular levels.

        <tr id="As of early October 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, resulted in approximately 35 million cases and one million fatalities worldwide. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease marked by the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies and a lack of tolerance to nuclear self-antigens. Hypocomple-mentemia, or an abnormal blood complement deficit, is a reliable predictor of infection in SLE patients. Moreover, it has been found that immunoglobulin (Ig), particularly IgG and IgM, is lowered in SLE patients, which may be a factor in their heightened susceptibility to infection. Bloodstream autoantibodies, lymphopenia, aberrant T cells, proinflammatory cytokines, and impaired regulatory systems all lead to an immune response that is aberrant in lupus patients. SLE patients exhibit impaired CD8 T cell responses, including abnormal phagocytosis and chemotaxis. Recent study has shown that COVID-19 infections significantly boost type I inter-feron responses. Patients with SLE and Covid-19 infection typically get immune-suppressing drugs viz corticosteroids, Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK), and tocilizumab, which improve their immune systems and diminution susceptible to Covid-19 infections.">

        <tr id="This work aimed to investigate interactions between antibody-opsonized SARS-CoV-2 and monocytes enriched from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to determine whether antibody dependent enhancement might contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Pre-incubation of SARS-CoV-2 with sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients led to significantly increased virus uptake and viral replication in monocytes. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 pre-incubated with sera from patients with severe COVID-19 but not those with mild disease or post vaccination strongly increased IL-6 secretion by monocytes. Antibody dependent viral uptake was partially inhibited by monoclonal anti-FcγRIIa antibody whereas IL-6 secretion was completely abolished. FcγRIIa preferentially binds IgG2, and sera from patients with severe COVID-19 contained lower IgG2 levels as compared to mild COVID-19 cases whereas IgG1 levels were increased. These data suggests that FcγRIIa-mediated binding of antibody-opsonized SARS-CoV-2 critically impacts monocytic inflammatory cytokine release and COVID-19 pathophysiology.">

        <tr id="Abstract The development of antiviral drugs against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) responsible for the recent Covid‐19 pandemic is crucial, as treatment options remain limited and vaccination does not prevent (re)infection. Two relatively underexplored targets of this virus are the 3′‐5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) and the 2’‐O‐methyltransferase (2′‐O‐MTase), both essential for viral viability. The non‐structural proteins Nsp14 and Nsp16 exhibit enzymatic activities for ExoN and 2′‐O‐MTase, respectively, especially when in complex with their co‐factor protein Nsp10. The study focuses on the use of target‐directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (tdDCC) to identify binders of Nsp10, aiming to disturb the protein‐protein interactions (PPI) involving Nsp10‐Nsp14, as well as Nsp10‐Nsp16. We synthesised the hits and evaluated them to assess Nsp10 affinity, ExoN and 2′‐O‐MTase activities inhibition, and antiviral activity in hCoV‐229E and SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected whole‐cell settings. This study reports a novel class of ExoN and/or 2′‐O‐MTase inhibitors exhibiting antiviral activity against coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 and post-COVID (long COVID) are associated with thromboembolic complications; however, it is still not clear whether platelets play a leading role in this phenomenon. The platelet hyperreactivity could result from the direct interaction between platelets and viral elements or the response to inflammatory and prothrombotic factors released from blood and vessel cells following infection. The existing literature does not provide clear-cut answers, as the results determining platelet status vary according to methodology. Elevated levels of soluble markers of platelet activation (P selectin, PF4), increased platelet aggregates, and platelet-derived microparticles suggest the activation of platelets circulating in the bloodstream of COVID-19 patients. Similarly, platelets isolated from COVID-19 patients demonstrate increased reactivity in response to collagen, thrombin, and ADP. By contrast, an analysis of whole blood from COVID-19 patients indicates the reduced activation of the fibrinogen receptor. Similarly, some in vitro studies report potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 in platelets, whereas others do not indicate any direct effect of the virus on platelets. The aim of this work is to review and evaluate the reliability of the methodology for testing platelet function after contact with SARS-CoV-2. Despite the diversity of methods yielding varying results and the influence of plasma components or blood cells, it can be concluded that platelets play an important role in the development of thrombotic complications after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a profound global impact since its emergence in late 2019. Characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress and death, COVID-19 has necessitated extensive research into the host-pathogen interactions that drive disease progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies. This study employed a multi-omic approach that combined direct RNA sequencing (DRS) and Illumina cDNA sequencing to investigate whole blood transcriptomic profiles in COVID-19 patients. By leveraging the unique capabilities of Nanopore DRS, which provides long-read sequencing data, we were able to capture not only gene expression levels but also crucial RNA modifications, including poly(A) tail length, non-adenine residue (non-A), pseudouridylation (psU), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation. This comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore the impact of these RNA modifications on gene expression and function within the context of COVID-19. Our findings reveal significant alterations in gene expression patterns, poly(A) tail lengths, non-A and the prevalence of psU and m5C modifications in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. These results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between viral infection, host immune response, and RNA processing, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Despite safety concerns regarding the toxicity of tattoo ink, no studies have reported the consequences of tattooing on the immune response. In this work, we have characterized the transport and accumulation of different tattoo inks in the lymphatic system using a murine model. Upon quick lymphatic drainage, we observed that macrophages mainly capture the ink in the lymph node (LN). An initial inflammatory reaction at local and systemic levels follows ink capture. Notably, the inflammatory process is maintained over time as we observed clear signs of inflammation in the draining LN two months following tattooing. In addition, the capture of ink by macrophages was associated with the induction of apoptosis in both human and murine models. Furthermore, the ink accumulated in the LN altered the immune response against a COVID-19 vaccine. We observed a reduced antibody response following vaccination with a mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which was associated with a decreased expression of the Spike protein in macrophages in the draining LN. Considering the unstoppable trend of tattooing in the population, our results are crucial in informing the toxicology programs, policymakers, and the general public regarding the potential risk of the tattooing practice associated with an altered immune response.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to an unprecedented global health crisis. While primarily recognized for its respiratory implications, the virus has shown a significant affinity for the nervous system, resulting in a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations. This literature review explores the intersection of neurology and virology, focusing on the acute and long-term neurological effects of COVID-19.
Methods: A comprehensive review of current literature was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Relevant studies were selected based on their focus on the pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and long-term neurological outcomes of COVID-19. Special attention was given to peer-reviewed articles, meta-analyses, and clinical case reports published between 2019 and 2024.
Results: The review identifies multiple mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 invades the nervous system, including direct viral entry and systemic inflammation. Acute neurological manifestations include encephalitis, stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, while long-term sequelae encompass cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, and psychiatric disorders. The findings underscore the complexity of COVID-19’s impact on the nervous system, with both immediate and enduring effects.
Conclusion: Neuro-COVID represents a significant and evolving challenge in the context of the pandemic. Understanding the neurological implications of COVID-19 is crucial for improving patient outcomes and guiding future research. This review underscores the need for heightened clinical awareness and a multidisciplinary approach to effectively address the complex neuro-COVID spectrum.">

        <tr id="Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) caused by bacteria or viruses are associated with stroke severity. Recent studies have revealed an imbalance in the von Willebrand factor (VWF)-ADAMTS13 axis in patients with RTIs, including COVID-19. We examined whether this imbalance contributes to RTI-mediated stroke severity. Wild-type (WT), Vwf -/-, or Adamts13-/- mice with respective littermate controls (Vwf +/+, or Adamts13+/+) were infected intranasally with sublethal doses of S. aureus (on days 0, 2, and 5) or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (on day 0) and subjected to transient (30 or 45 min) cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion. In S. aureus-infected mice, infarct volumes were assessed on day 2 and functional outcomes on weeks 1 and 4 post-reperfusion. In SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, infarct volumes and functional outcomes (Bederson score) were assessed on day 1 post-reperfusion. We demonstrated that S. aureus or SARS-CoV-2 RTI was accompanied by an imbalance in the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis and an increase in plasma levels of IL-6, CXCL1, and MCP-1, which was associated with larger infarcts and worse functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. mock-infection). S. aureus- or SARS-CoV-2-infected Vwf -/- mice exhibited reduced infarcts and improved functional outcomes, while infected Adamts13-/- mice displayed greater stroke severity (P<0.05 vs. control). In the models of RTI preceding stroke, VWF contributes to stroke severity, while ADAMTS13 is protective.">

Methods We performed single-cell transcriptome coupled with T-cell/B-cell receptor (TCR/BCR) sequencing in 15 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from Omicron infection and naïve with booster vaccination. Results We found that after breakthrough infection, multiple cell clusters showed activation of the type I IFN pathway and widespread expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); T and B lymphocytes exhibited antiviral and proinflammatory-related differentiation features with pseudo-time trajectories; and large TCR clonal expansions were concentrated in effector CD8 T cells, and clonal expansions of BCRs showed a preference for IGHV3. In addition, myeloid cells in the BA.5.2 breakthrough infection with the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV were characterized by enhanced proliferation, chemotactic migration, and antigen presentation. Discussion Collectively, our study informs the comprehensive understandings of immune characterization for Omicron breakthrough infection, revealing the positive antiviral potential induced by booster doses of vaccine and the possible "trained immunity" phenomenon in the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV, providing a basis for the selection of vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="In a subset of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals treated with the antiviral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the virus rebounds following treatment. The mechanisms driving this rebound are not well understood. We used a mathematical model to describe the longitudinal viral load dynamics of 51 individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, 20 of whom rebounded. Target cell preservation, either by a robust innate immune response or initiation of N-R near the time of symptom onset, coupled with incomplete viral clearance, appears to be the main factor leading to viral rebound. Moreover, the occurrence of viral rebound is likely influenced by the time of treatment initiation relative to the progression of the infection, with earlier treatments leading to a higher chance of rebound. A comparison with an untreated cohort suggests that early treatments with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be associated with a delay in the onset of an adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, our model demonstrates that extending the course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment to a 10-day regimen may greatly diminish the chance of rebound in people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. Altogether, our results suggest that in some individuals, a standard 5-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir starting around the time of symptom onset may not completely eliminate the virus. Thus, after treatment ends, the virus can rebound if an effective adaptive immune response has not fully developed. These findings on the role of target cell preservation and incomplete viral clearance also offer a possible explanation for viral rebounds following other antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2.


IMPORTANCE
Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. In a subset of individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the initial reduction in viral load is followed by viral rebound once treatment is stopped. We show that the timing of treatment initiation with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may influence the risk of viral rebound. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir stops viral growth and preserves target cells but may not lead to full clearance of the virus. Thus, once treatment ends, if an effective adaptive immune response has not adequately developed, the remaining virus can lead to rebound. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of rebound and can help develop better treatment strategies to minimize this possibility.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids. SUMMARY The neurotropic Usutu virus can cause encephalitis driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment, microglia activation and blood-brain barrier disruption, all of which are inhibited by glucocorticoid treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a significant global public health challenge. While respiratory symptoms dominate, the virus's impact on other systems, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), has gained increasing attention. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates tropism for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, expressed in the olfactory epithelium, lungs, endothelium, kidneys, enterocytes, and neurons, contributing to neurological manifestations observed during the acute phase of the disease.  
Materials and Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. Keywords included: COVID-19, Post Acute COVID-19 Syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 Virus, Neurological Manifestations, and Central Nervous System Viral Diseases. A total of 58 articles were selected for analysis based on relevance and quality of evidence regarding neurological symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19.  
Basic Results: The acute phase of COVID-19 frequently involves neurological symptoms such as frontal and holocranial headaches, dizziness, gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, and alterations in consciousness. Severe complications, though less common, include encephalitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and myelitis. These conditions often present as altered mental status, seizures, aphasia, headaches, or focal deficits, contributing substantially to patient morbidity and mortality.  
Conclusions: Neurological symptoms and complications constitute a significant aspect of COVID-19, highlighting the virus's potential to affect the CNS. While severe complications are rare, their profound impact on prognosis underscores the importance of early recognition and management. Further research is essential to understand the pathophysiology and optimise therapeutic approaches for affected patients. ">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 provokes acute oxidative stress in the lungs via cytokines, inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic factors, which might cause alveolar injury followed by severe respiratory syndrome during COVID-19 infection. The lack of particular antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 has opened novel avenues of complementary and alternative medicine as a potential remedy. The current study explored the mechanistic role of the ultradiluted formulation of Eupatorium (UDE) against SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S protein-mediated oxidative stress and mitochondriopathy. Methods: Cell line and BALB/c mice were used to report that SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused an inflammatory response and subsequent cytokine storm via the NF-κB pathway in the lung along with oxidative damage. Morphological examination was performed using DAPI staining and histology for treated cells and lung tissues of animals, respectively. The molecular mechanism of action of UDE was investigated through qRT-PCR for the genetic expressions of various cytokines, inflammatory, and apoptotic mediators; ELISA, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot for the translational expression of the same molecules assayed for genetic expressions; and biochemical assays for various enzymes and ROS. Results: UDE treatment suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue-level oxidative stress and safeguarded mitochondrial integrity from free radical-mediated oxidative damage. Additionally, UDE played a direct role in restoring cellular redox homeostasis and reducing the inflammatory response by suppressing NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-1 expression, and ROS formation. Further, a plausible mechanism of action of UDE against S protein-induced damage was proposed. Conclusions: This study described a novel therapeutic approach against S protein-mediated hyperinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative damage. Hence, UDE may be considered as a prospective alternative to combat life-threatening consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Host-related factors influence the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection; for instance, the expression of host microRNAs (miRNAs) could influence the progression and complications of COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the expression pattern of endogenous miRNAs in 80 severe COVID-19 patients compared to a group of healthy individuals. Materials and Methods The miRNA screening expression analysis was performed using TaqMan Low-Density Array, and the expression changes of miR-490-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-454-3p, and miR-431-5p were validated using RT-qPCR. In silico analysis was used to identify new targets and predict the pathways, biological processes, and interactions of the selected miRNAs. Results The miR-490-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-454-3p, and miR-431-5p, were over-expressed in the total population of severe COVID-19 patients compared to the control group. miR-490-3p was found to be over-expressed in both female and male COVID-19 patients.

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the recognition of viral particles and activation of the innate immune system, but their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still poorly characterized. In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 10 (TLR10) in modulating the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results showed that overexpression of TLR10 in A549 lung epithelial cells, immunostimulated with SARS-CoV-2 proteins S and N mainly downregulated proinflammatory cytokines and interferons and affected gene expression in the cocultured THP-1 monocytes. Our results suggest that TLR10 could mediate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection by downregulating the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL10, IL6, IL8, and IFNβ. Modulation of TLR10 expression could have implications for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, in whom excessive inflammation leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a key feature. However, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of modulating TLR10 expression on the antiviral response and the overall balance of the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection disturbs the coagulation balance in the blood, triggering thrombosis and contributing to organ failure. The role of prothrombotic metabolites in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains elusive. Leveraging K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, we observed higher levels of the tryptophan metabolite, kynurenine, compared to controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed a significant upregulation of enzymes controlling Kynurenine biogenesis, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase levels in kidneys and liver, respectively, as well as changes in the enzymes involved in kynurenine catabolism, including kynurenine monooxygenase and kynurinase. Consistent with the agonistic role of these metabolites in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) signaling, AHR activation and its downstream mediator, tissue factor (TF), a highly potent procoagulant factor, was observed in endothelial cells (ECs) of lungs and kidneys of infected mice. These findings were validated in humans, where compared to controls, sera of COVID-19 patients showed increased levels of Kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid. Activation of the AHR-TF axis was noted in the kidneys and lungs of COVID-19 patients, and COVID-19 sera showed higher IDO-1 activity than controls. Levels of Kyn in COVID-19 patients correlated strongly with the TF-inducing activity of COVID-19 sera on ECs. A specific IDO-1 inhibitor or AHR inhibitor separately or in combination suppressed COVID-19 sera-induced TF activity in ECs. Together, we identified IDO-1 as upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in augmented Kyn and its prothrombotic catabolites, thereby suggesting the Kyn-AHR-TF axis as possibly a new diagnostic and/or therapeutic target. Key points SARS-CoV-2-infection upregulates kynurenine biogenesis in the liver and diminishes kynurenine catabolism in the lungs and kidneys. An increase in kynurenine stimulates the AHR-TF axis in the microvasculature in COVID-19 patients, which is inhibited by pharmacological manipulation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 remain a major global health challenge. We have discovered a second-generation small molecule 3CL protease inhibitor S-892216 that is proceeding with phase 1 study in Japan. S-892216 has potent antiviral activity and addresses current treatment concerns of currently available antivirals regarding drug-drug interaction (DDI) and safety. We evaluated the therapeutic effect of S-892216 by using SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster model. In this study, virus titer in lungs and nasal turbinates (NT), lung inflammation, body weight loss and lung weight increase caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. Methods Syrian hamsters were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BE.1/BA.5-like. The hamsters were orally treated twice daily with S-892216 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg or ensitrelvir 50 mg/kg, or subcutaneously treated with nirmatrelvir 750/250 mg/kg (750 mg/kg for the loading dose and 250 mg/kg for the maintenance doses) from 1 day post infection for 5 days. Lungs and NT were collected for virus titers and lung inflammation evaluation. Lung weights were measured 7 days post infection and body weight changes were monitored until 14 days post infection. Results Oral treatment with S-892216 significantly reduced virus titers in lung (1.9- and 2.9-log reduction at the doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and NT (1.8- and 2.3-log reduction at the doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) 3 days post infection. In addition, S-892216 suppressed lung inflammation and body weight loss caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection dose dependently. The virus titer reduction in lung and NT and suppression of lung inflammation and body weight losses were comparable in S-892216 1 mg/kg, ensitrelvir 50 mg/kg and nirmatrelvir 750/250 mg/kg treatment groups. Conclusion Oral treatment with S-892216 exhibited therapeutic effect in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. Furthermore, S-892216 showed comparable efficacy at lower dosages compared to ensitrelvir and nirmatrelvir. These findings suggest that S-892216 could be used at lower dosage than the current treatment options in clinical settings. We will evaluate DDI and the safety potential of S-892216 in clinical trials in future.

        <tr id="Single-cell transcriptomics applied to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for elucidating the pathophysiology of neurologic diseases has produced only a preliminary characterization of CSF immune cells. CSF derives from and borders central nervous system (CNS) tissue, allowing for comprehensive accounting of cell types along with their relative abundance and immunologic profiles relevant to CNS diseases. Using integration techniques applied to publicly available datasets in combination with our own studies, we generated a compendium with 139 subjects encompassing 135 CSF and 58 blood samples. Healthy subjects and individuals across a wide range of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, COVID-19, and autoimmune encephalitis, were included. We found differences in lymphocyte and myeloid subset frequencies across different diseases as well as in their distribution between blood and CSF. We identified what we believe to be a new subset of AREG+ dendritic cells exclusive to the CSF that was more abundant in subjects with MS compared with healthy controls. Finally, transcriptional cell states in CSF microglia-like cells and lymphoid subsets were elucidated. Altogether, we have created a reference compendium for single-cell transcriptional profiling encompassing CSF immune cells useful to the scientific community for future studies on neurologic diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute COVID-19 infection causes significant alterations in the innate and adaptive immune systems. While most individuals recover naturally, some develop long COVID (LC) syndrome, marked by persistent or new symptoms weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, there are no clinical tests to distinguish LC patients from those fully recovered. Understanding the immunological basis of LC is essential for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches. Methods We performed deep immunophenotyping and functional assays to examine the immunological profiles of LC patients, individuals with active COVID-19, recovered patients, and healthy donors. This analysis assessed both innate and adaptive immune features, identifying potential biomarkers for LC syndrome. A Binomial Generalized Linear Model (BGLM) was used to pinpoint immune features characterizing LC. Results COVID-19 patients exhibited depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes, and monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells. Elevated basal inflammation was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to LC patients, whose immune profiles were closer to those of healthy donors and recovered individuals. However, LC patients displayed persistent immune alterations, including reduced T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Tregs) and switched memory B cells, similar to COVID-19 patients. Through BGLM, a unique adaptive immune signature for LC was identified, featuring memory CD8 and gd T cells with low proliferative capacity and diminished expression of activation and homing receptors. Discussion The findings highlight a unique immunological signature associated with LC syndrome, characterized by persistent adaptive immune dysregulation. While LC patients displayed recovery in innate immune profiles comparable to healthy and Recovered individuals, deficits in T cell and memory B cell populations were evident, differentiating LC from full recovery. These findings provide insights into LC pathogenesis and may support the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Many common symptoms in post-acute sequelae following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) overlap with those of multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined symptoms and performance of the PASC score, developed in the general population, in MS based on infection history.


METHODS
We surveyed North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry participants regarding infections and categorized participants based on infection history. Symptoms experienced before, during, and after infection were used to identify persistent new symptoms. PASC was defined as a score ⩾ 12 based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study RECOVER.


RESULTS
Of 4787 participants surveyed, 2927 were included: 294 (10%) having recent COVID-19; 853 (29.1%) recent non-COVID-19 infection; 246 (8.4%) recent COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infection; 1534 (52.4%) uninfected, defined as never having COVID-19 nor any infection within the past 6 months. Compared to those uninfected, infection groups reported at least a two-fold increase in fever, cough, loss of smell/taste, and shortness of breath. Based on persistent new symptoms, PASC was identified in only 1.5% of participants with COVID-19.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests lower than expected prevalence of PASC in MS and a complex association between infections and development of new persistent symptoms following infections. The similar proportions classified with PASC across infection groups shows that symptoms of PASC are common and complicate assessment of PASC in MS.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with the enveloped RNA betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, led to a global pandemic involving over 7 million deaths. Macrophage inflammatory responses impact COVID-19 severity; however, it is unclear whether macrophages are infected by SARS-CoV-2. We sought to identify mechanisms regulating macrophage expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and to determine if macrophages are susceptible to productive infection. We developed a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mouse whereby hACE2 cDNA was cloned into the mouse ACE2 locus under control of the native promoter. We validated susceptibility of hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to wild-type mice and an established K18-hACE2 model of acute fulminating disease. Intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 led to pulmonary consolidations with cellular infiltrate, edema, and hemorrhage, consistent with pneumonia, yet unlike the K18-hACE2 model, hACE2 mice survived and maintained stable weight. Infected hACE2 mice also exhibited a unique plasma chemokine, cytokine, and growth factor inflammatory signature relative to K18-hACE2 mice. Infected hACE2 mice demonstrated evidence of viral replication in infiltrating lung macrophages, and infection of macrophages in vitro revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of altered RNA and ribosomal processing machinery as well as activated cellular antiviral defense. Macrophage IL-1β-driven NF-κB transcription of ACE2 was an important mechanism of dynamic ACE2 upregulation, promoting macrophage susceptibility to infection. Experimental models of COVID-19 that make use of native hACE2 expression will allow for mechanistic insight into factors that can either promote host resilience or increase susceptibility to worsening severity of infection.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is central to temporal lobe epilepsy, yet the specific role of myeloid cells remains unclear. In status epilepticus (SE) models, circulating monocytes have been reported to infiltrate the brain, though distinguishing them from microglia remains challenging. Using a rat model, we traced infiltrating monocytes post-SE, to investigate their persistence, phenotypic evolution during epileptogenesis and contribution to neuroinflammation. By tracking phagocyted fluorescent nanoparticles and using CD68 immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that monocytes entered the brain in significant numbers 24 hours post-SE, after the inflammatory peak occurred (7h post-SE). Tracked up to 7 weeks, these cells adopted a microglia-like phenotype, contributed to the microglial scar and sustained low-grade inflammation during the chronic phase of epilepsy solely through their presence, as their expression of pro-inflammatory markers resembled that of non-activated microglia. Importantly, monocytes initially and transiently supported an anti-inflammatory response providing a unique opportunity to modulate neuroinflammation and potentially disrupt epilepsy progression, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), alarmed the global community due to the significant loss of human lives during the pandemic. However, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. A positive aspect of this recent pandemic has been that it stimulated scientists to create vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, accelerating the emergence of new therapeutic agents based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Numerous mRNA therapeutic products are currently in development, with dozens at various clinical trial stages. These products have facilitated significant changes in the paradigm of medical therapy, including the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although most of these cardiovascular mRNA therapeutics are still in preclinical development, phase IIa trials for myocardial ischemia therapy have already been completed with encouraging results. The scope of mRNA therapy for CVD is extremely broad, potentially even limitless, with ongoing research including conditions like myocardial ischemia, heart failure, arrhythmias, hypercholesterolemia, and occlusive arterial diseases. Moreover, mRNA can be used to enhance the effectiveness of cell therapies. In the future, researchers predict that mRNA therapies will not only replace some existing biopharmaceuticals and pharmacotherapy methods but also be applied to treat previously considered untreatable cardiovascular diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Factors leading to severe COVID-19 remain partially known. New biomarkers predicting COVID-19 severity that are also causally involved in disease pathogenesis could improve patient management and contribute to the development of innovative therapies. Autophagy, a cytosolic structure degradation pathway is involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, degradation of intracellular pathogens and generation of energy for immune responses. Acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) is a key regulator of autophagy in the context of diabetes, obesity and anorexia. The objective of our work was to assess whether circulating ACBP levels are associated with COVID-19 severity, using proteomics data from the plasma of 903 COVID-19 patients. Methods Somalogic proteomic analysis was used to detect 5000 proteins in plasma samples collected between March 2020 and August 2021 from hospitalized participants in the province of Quebec, Canada. Plasma samples from 903 COVID-19 patients collected during their admission during acute phase of COVID-19 and 295 hospitalized controls were assessed leading to 1198 interpretable proteomic profiles. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were measured by ELISA and a cell-binding assay. Results The median age of the participants was 59 years, 46% were female, 65% had comorbidities. Plasma ACBP levels correlated with COVID-19 severity, in association with inflammation and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, independently of sex or the presence of comorbidities. Samples collected during the second COVID-19 wave in Quebec had higher levels of plasma ACBP than during the first wave. Plasma ACBP levels were negatively correlated with biomarkers of T and NK cell responses interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-21, independently of age, sex, and severity. Conclusions Circulating ACBP levels can be considered a biomarker of COVID-19 severity linked to inflammation. The contribution of extracellular ACBP to immunometabolic responses during viral infection should be further studied.">

Data regarding functional roles of human T cells in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) viral clearance in primary COVID-19 are limited. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed samples for associations between SARS2 upper respiratory tract viral RNA levels and early virus-specific adaptive immune responses for 95 unvaccinated clinical trial participants with acute primary COVID-19 aged 18–86 years old, approximately half of whom were considered at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Functionality and magnitude of acute SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated, in addition to antibody responses. Most individuals with acute COVID-19 developed SARS2-specific T cell responses within 6 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Early CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were polyfunctional, and both strongly associated with reduced upper respiratory tract SARS2 viral RNA, independent of neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, these findings provide evidence for protective roles for circulating SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious threat to people worldwide causing a variety of diseases, manifesting with intestinal, respiratory, hepatic, and neurological symptoms. The therapeutic strategy to counteract SARS-CoV-2 encompasses antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, such as systemic glucocorticoids which may benefit patients with middle and severe COVID-19. The spike glycoprotein (S protein), which recognizes the host cell receptor and initiates the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to it, can be considered a potential target for glucocorticoids. However, the mechanism of glucocorticoid inhibitory action against the S protein is currently unclear due to insufficient study of the ligand-binding sites on the S protein. The aim of the study was to evaluate the binding characteristics of systemic glucocorticoids to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and to elucidate the topological features of non-covalent ligand-protein complexes. AutoDock Vina was used for molecular docking studies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with ligands. Dexamethasone (DEX), methylprednisolone (Medrol), triamcinolone (TAC), and prednisone (PRED) were selected as ligands. The Open Babel 3.1.1 software was used to prepare ligand structures. Two 3D structures of the S protein which have open (RBD-up) and closed (RBD-down) conformations in the receptor-binding domain (PDB ID: 6VYB, and PDB ID: 6VXX), respectively, were used as docking targets (www.rcsb.org). Ligand interactions with amino acid residues were identified using the PLIP web tool (https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de). Visualization of docking results was implemented in PyMol 2.5. Docking study demonstrated that all glucocorticoids can bind to multiple sites in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including the receptor-binding fragment (S1) and the fusion fragment (S2). Methylprednisolone showed the best affinity with the S protein in RBD-up conformation than other glucocorticoids, with a binding free energy of –9.7 kcal/mole and an inhibition constant value of 0.08⋅10–6 M. Triamcinolone demonstrated a high affinity with the S protein in RBD-down conformation, at which the binding free energy was −8.8 kcal/mole and an inhibition constant value was 0.36⋅10–6 M. Our results show that Gly744, Asp745 and Arg1000 are mainly involved in the stabilization of complexes through the hydrogen bonds. Hydrophobic interactions are primarily mediated by Thr572, Ile587, and Val976. These results are an important basis for the development of potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2.">

While acute COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique patterns of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID">

        <tr id="Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and long-term complications in bone health. Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces bone turnover and promotes bone loss, but the mechanism underlying worsened bone health remains elusive. This study sought to identify specific immune mediators that exacerbated preexisting IMIDs after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Plasma samples from 4 groups were analyzed: healthy, IMID only, COVID-19 only, and COVID-19 + IMID. Using high-throughput multiplexed proteomics, we profiled 1,500 protein biomarkers and identified 148 unique biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with IMIDs, including elevated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17F) and bone resorption markers. Long-term circulating SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, a virulence factor for COVID-19, was detected in the COVID + IMID group. RA was one of the most common IMIDs in our study. ORF8 treatment of RA-derived human osteoblasts (RA-hOBs) increased levels of inflammatory (TNF, IL6, CCL2) and bone resorption (RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio) markers compared with healthy controls. Supernatants from ORF8-treated RA-hOBs drove the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast-like cells. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exposure can exacerbate IMIDs through ORF8-driven inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19–induced bone pathologies.">

Recent studies have reported that severe cases of COVID-19 are primarily characterized
by endotheliitis (or endothelialitis), whose severity is related to the pre-existing or current damage to
the complex structure that lines the surface of the vascular endothelium, most notably the glycocalyx.
Such damage results in the loss of many endothelial cell functions. To restore these functions, the
cell must repair the glycocalyx that covers it. However, this is not always possible, especially when
the repair capacity of such an exo-endo-cytoplasmic cell structure is limited due to cellular senescence.
If the gene repair system remains activated, the damaged glycocalyx can be reconstituted via
specific transcriptional pathways in response to oxidative and reductive stresses. Despite the experimental
evidence in favour of this hypothesis, many of the recently published reviewrs on long
COVID do not mention the use of therapeutic treatments via specific 'oxidative eustress'. In fact,
mild and controlled oxidative stress is able to induce an activating response to cellular damage repair
processes. This perspective aims to draw the attention of researchers to these aspects in an attempt to
address this gap in understanding.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic and devastating health crisis. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), and the exaggerated immune response resulting from infection with this disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality.  Activation may have a contribution to disease severity.A case study was carried out in order to find the association between COVID-19, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2. The effect of age, sex, smoking, diabetic and hypertention on the level of the studied cytokines were evaluated. Inaddition, the influnce of COVID-19 severity on TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2 levels were studied. Blood samples were collected from 50 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who visited of Al-Hussein Teaching hospital and 50 control people, during the period from (May -November 2021). The ages of the patients ranged from (Twenty two years to seventy six years). The serum samples were used in detection of TNF-α , IL-8 and IL-2  by using ELISA test. Then   the collected data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 11. The results showed that that the most affected age group was (40-60) years old followed by less than 40 years old and more than 60 years old. The numbers of patients were 29, 11 and 10 respectively. Most of COVID-19 patients were male (56 %:28), while the rest cases were females (44%:22). The mean values of the studied cytokines in COVID-19 patients in both sex and all age groups were more than their counter parters in H.C group. The effect of main risk factors for severe and long COVID-19 include age, sex, smoking, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension) on variations in the level of studied cytokines of the host were found significantly. Moreover, the effect of COVID-19 severity on the studied cytokines was highly significants. The maximum values of cytokines were obtaind in critical degree followed by severe and moderate severity.  It is concluded from the study's results that patients infected with severe SARS-CoV-2 experience increasing proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 that produce signaling the initial phase of cytokine storm. Thus, further studies should be conducted to use the studied cytokines inhibitors as a treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The availability of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus data post-COVID has reached exponentially to an enormous magnitude, opening research doors to analyze its behavior. Various studies are conducted by researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the virus, like genomic surveillance, etc, so that efficient prevention mechanisms can be developed. However, the unstable nature of the virus (rapid mutations, multiple hosts, etc) creates challenges in designing analytical systems for it. Therefore, we propose a neural network-based (NN) mechanism to perform an efficient analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 data, as NN portrays generalized behavior upon training. Moreover, rather than using the full-length genome of the virus, we apply our method to its spike region, as this region is known to have predominant mutations and is used to attach to the host cell membrane. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline that first converts the spike protein sequences into a fixed-length numerical representation and then uses Neuromorphic Spiking Neural Network to classify those sequences. We compare the performance of our method with various baselines using real-world SARS-CoV-2 spike sequence data and show that our method is able to achieve higher predictive accuracy compared to the recent baselines.">

        <tr id="Globally, sepsis remains a major health issue, with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) being a leading cause of mortality. MODS, a severe condition often seen in intensive care units, typically results from infections or trauma and involves complex pathophysiological processes requiring various clinical interventions. Although infections are the main triggers, the mechanisms driving MODS remain unclear. To investigate the transition of sepsis to MODS, we generated a single cell RNA sequencing dataset comprising 86,839 immune cells from pediatric sepsis patients at the clinical onset of MODS patients and age-matched controls, identifying 22 distinct cell types. A cluster of S100 genes, located in the same genomic region, was highly expressed in neutrophils in MODS patients, demonstrating strong diagnostic potential across cohorts (AUC=0.94– 0.99) and potential as therapeutic targets. We found that many B and T cells showed heightened inflammation and increased apoptotic activity during early MODS. Additionally, specific transcription regulators and surface proteins associated with inflammation and S100 regulations were uniquely expressed in MODS. Pseudotime analysis revealed distinct S100 gene expression patterns between controls and MODS. Cell-cell interaction analysis highlighted dendritic cells as key mediators, enhancing communication between plasma cells and Vδ T cells while activating inflammatory and immunosuppressive pathways. We also analyzed 116,803 immune cells from adult MODS patients, revealing stronger immune dysregulation compared to pediatric MODS, including altered S100 gene expression, and enhanced cell-cell interactions. These findings suggest that S100 genes may serve as a marker for MODS. Furthermore, insights gained from adult MODS could improve our understanding of rare pediatric MODS and contribute to the development of better therapeutics for all MODS patients.">

        <tr id="Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide range of treatment options have been evaluated in preclinical studies and clinical trials, with several being approved for use in humans. Immunomodulatory drugs have shown success in dampening the deleterious inflammatory response seen in severe COVID-19 patients, but there remains an urgent need for development of additional therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. A potential drug target is the CCR5-CCL5 axis, and blocking this pathway may protect against severe disease. Here we evaluated whether OB-002, an analog of human CCL5 and a potent antagonist of CCR5, provides therapeutic benefit in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. Daily treatment with OB-002 altered immune gene transcription in the lungs, and reduced pathology following infection, but did not prevent weight loss or viral replication in the lungs of infected animals, even in combination with the antiviral drug remdesivir. Our data suggest that targeting the CCR5-CCL5 pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters is insufficient to significantly impact disease development in this model.">

        <tr id="Background Several years after the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of trained immunity in COVID-19 remains controversial, and questions regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19 on immune cells remain unresolved. We investigated the roles of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination and latent infections in the progression of COVID-19 and sepsis. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of 97 individuals recovering from mild-to-critical COVID-19 and 64 sepsis patients. Immune cell frequencies, expression of functional markers, and plasma titres of anti-Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies were assessed and their impact on disease severity and outcomes were determined. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS. Results Post COVID-19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterized mainly by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post-critical COVID-19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. Additionally, a higher frequency of CMV and T. gondii seropositive-alongside a lower frequency of BCG seropositive-patients were associated with severe and critical COVID-19. However, the monocyte response to stimulation was unaffected by the severity of COVID-19. Conclusion These findings highlight the long-term alterations of immune cells in post-COVID-19 patients emphasizing the substantial impact of COVID-19 on immune function. However, our data showed no relationship between previous BCG vaccination and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) are critical for neuronal support functions, including myelination and remyelination. Emerging evidence reveals their active roles in neuroinflammation, particularly in conditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study explores the inflammatory translatome of OLCs during the early onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an established MS model. Using RiboTag-based RNA sequencing in genetically modified Olig2-Cre RiboTag mice, we identified 1,556 upregulated and 683 downregulated genes in EAE OLCs. Enrichment analysis indicated heightened immune-related pathways, such as cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and antigen presentation, while downregulated genes were linked to neuronal development and myelination. Notably, OLCs expressed cytokines/chemokines, and their receptor, highlighting their active involvement in neuroinflammatory signaling. Functional studies demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling in OLCs exacerbates EAE pathology by enhancing antigen presentation and chemokine production, whereas interferon-beta (IFN-β) signaling showed minimal impact. These findings provide novel insights into the inflammatory role of OLCs in EAE and suggest therapeutic potential in targeting OLC-mediated neuroinflammation for MS and related disorders.">

        <tr id="Based on the analysis of literature data, the issues of neurological complications after the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 are highlighted. There is little evidence for a direct mechanism for the neuroinvasiveness and neurotoxicity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Various mechanisms of coronavirus penetration into the brain are discussed - anterograde and retrograde, neuronal spread, transcriptional and hematogenous pathways. Retrograde/anterograde transport and transsynaptic transfer of the virus have been confi rmed by in vitro studies. Penetration of the virus into the central nervous system is also possible by spreading through peripheral nerves, for example, along the vagus nerve, which innervates the lungs and intestines. There are several possible mechanisms for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the blood-brain barrier: circulation of viral particles in the bloodstream, viral transcytosis through endothelial cells of blood vessels and capillaries, infection of leukocytes by viruses and transfer of viruses through the blood-brain barrier. Hypoxia caused by cytokine storm and respiratory distress lead to disruption of brain metabolism and the development of neurological complications.Aim. Analysis of literature data on the study of early and long-term manifestations of neurological disorders and diseases during a new coronavirus infection, postCovid syndrome (long COVID-19), as well as after vaccination.Results.

Despite a plethora of recent research on both SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, few have taken a systems biology approach to address individual-level variation, especially based on non-European populations. Accordingly, we analyzed multi-omics data generated at three timepoints from 193 Korean COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms, composed of whole genome sequencing, blood-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (2.15M cells), 195 cytokine profiles, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele data. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), disease severity interacting eQTLs (n = 388), and disease progression interacting eQTLs (n = 945) for various cell types. We elucidated a complex regulatory mechanism involving HLA genes and their targets, and identified genetic determinants of cytokine levels. Finally, we show how regulation of ieQTLs is established by upstream transcription factors (TFs), illustrating complex regulation of the IGFBP7 ieQTL by a combined action of two TFs, which is potentially important in conferring differential severity. This study illuminates an efficient molecular interrogation framework that can be applied toward understanding infectious disease progression in individuals of different genotypes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), is a major concern due to its astonishing prevalence and high fatality rate, especially among elderly people. Patients suffering from COVID‐19 may exhibit immunosuppression in the initial stage of infection, while a cytokine storm can occur when the disease progresses to a severe stage. This inopportune immune rhythm not only makes patients more susceptible to the virus but also leads to numerous complications resulting from the excessive production of inflammatory factors. A20, which is widely accepted as a pivotal regulator of inflammation, has been shown to be implicated in the processes of antiviral responses and immunosuppression. Thus, A20 may participate in regulating the pathological processes of COVID‐19. Methods This narrative literature review summarizes recent evidence on the mechanisms of A20 in regulating the pathological processes of COVID‐19. We also downloaded single‐cell RNA‐seq data sets from healthy individuals and patients with varying severities of COVID‐19 from the NCBI GEO database to further dissect A20's regulatory mechanisms of these intricate cytokine pathways that are closely associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results A20 might be one of the most critical anti‐infectious and anti‐inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19. It effectively suppresses the immune damage and inflammatory storm caused by viral infection. Conclusions Understanding the relationship between A20‐regulated signaling pathways and pathological processes of COVID‐19 can provide insight into potential targets for intervention. Precise regulation of A20 to induce antiviral activity and an anti‐inflammatory response could mediate the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 and could become an effective treatment.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) ESX-1, a type VII secretion system, is a key virulence determinant contributing to MTB’s survival within lung mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), but its effect on MNP recruitment and differentiation remains unknown. Here, using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing techniques, we studied the role of ESX-1 in MNP heterogeneity and response in mice and murine bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDM). We found that ESX-1 is required for MTB to recruit diverse MNP subsets with high MTB burden. Further, MTB induces a transcriptional signature of immune evasion in lung macrophages and BMDM in an ESX-1–dependent manner. Spatial transcriptomics revealed an up-regulation of permissive features within MTB lesions, where monocyte-derived macrophages concentrate near MTB-infected cells. Together, our findings suggest that MTB ESX-1 facilitates the recruitment and differentiation of MNPs, which MTB can infect and manipulate for survival. Our dataset across various models and methods could contribute to the broader understanding of recruited cell heterogeneity during MTB lung infection.">

        <tr id="Anti-Aβ immunotherapy use to treat Alzheimer's disease is on the rise. While anti-Aβ antibodies provide hope in targeting Aβ plaques in the brain, there still remains a lack of understanding regarding the cellular responses to these antibodies in the brain. In this study, we sought to identify the acute effects of anti-Aβ antibodies on immune responses. To determine cellular changes due to anti-Aβ antibody exposure, we intracranially injected 14 mo APP male and female mice with anti-Aβ IgG1 (6E10) or control IgG1 into the cortex. After 24 h or 3 d, we harvested the cortex and performed a glial cell-enriched preparation for single-cell sequencing. Cell types, proportions, and cell-to-cell signaling were evaluated between the two injection conditions and two acute timepoints. We identified 23 unique cell clusters including microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells, neurons, oligos/OPCs, immune cells, and unknown. The anti-Aβ antibody-injected cortices revealed more ligand–receptor (L–R) communications between cell types, as well as stronger communications at only 24 h. At 3 d, while there were more L–R communications for the anti-Aβ antibody condition, the strength of these connections was stronger in the control IgG condition. We also found evidence of an initial and strong communication emphasis in microglia-to-nonparenchymal immune cells at 24 h, specifically in the TGFβ signaling pathway. We identify several pathways that are specific to anti-Aβ antibody exposure at acute timepoints. These data lay the groundwork for understanding the brain's unique response to anti-Aβ antibodies.">

Cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of mortality following infection. In this review, we discuss immune pathogenesis and four medications, including Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Dexamethasone, and Annual SZ for COVID-19. A comparison of the effectiveness and therapeutic usage of drugs as reported in clinical trials and reports was made at different disease levels as well. Clinical studies indicate that Annual SZ with mild side effects was more affordable and might be more effective than other medications.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The majority of COVID-19 infections in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological (Heme-Onc) diagnoses are mild with good outcome compared to adults. Postulated reasons include cross-protection from immunity against seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV’s), subdued inflammatory responses in children than in adults and differences in humoral and T-cell responses. The objectives of this study are to compare antibody responses against HCoV’s, anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral, T-cell, and inflammatory profiles between Heme-Onc children with COVID-19 and control groups. Methods Binding IgG antibodies against Spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2, four HCoV’s (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), quantitative levels of 21 cytokines and 9 chemokines (multiplexed solid-phase electrochemiluminescence assay by Meso Scale Diagnostics/MSD) were compared among five cohorts: 1) children with Heme-Onc diagnoses and COVID-19 (n = 41) 2) healthy children with COVID-19 (n = 21) 3) adults with COVID-19 (n = 14) 4) children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) [n = 23] and 5) healthy children without COVID-19 (n = 12). Additionally, T-cell responses against S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using ELISpot in Heme-Onc children a group of healthy children COVID-19. Results Anti-S antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV were significantly lower in children in Heme-Onc and healthy children with COVID-19 compared to adults with COVID-19 (Figure 1). The concentration of eight pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly lower in Heme-Onc and healthy children compared to adults with COVID-19 and children with MIS-C. The responder T-cell frequency varied between 0 and 860/100,000 PBMC at study enrollment in children with Heme-Onc diagnoses. Conclusion In this single-center study, cross-protection from HCoV antibodies is an unlikely mechanism to explain mild COVID-19 in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological diagnoses. Subdued inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be one of the factors for the mild COVID-19 disease phenotype in children.

        <tr id="Haemophilus ducreyi causes the genital ulcer disease chancroid and cutaneous ulcers in children. To study its pathogenesis, we developed a human challenge model in which we infect the skin on the upper arm of human volunteers with H. ducreyi to the pustular stage of disease. The model has been used to define lesional architecture, describe the immune infiltrate into the infected sites using flow cytometry, and explore the molecular basis of the immune response using bulk RNA-seq. Here, we used single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to simultaneously characterize multiple cell types within infected human skin and determine the cellular origin of differentially expressed transcripts that we had previously identified by bulk RNA-seq. We obtained paired biopsies of pustules and wounded (mock infected) sites from five volunteers for scRNA-seq. We identified 13 major cell types, including T- and NK-like cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, as well as other cell types typically found in the skin. Immune cell types were enriched in pustules, and some subtypes within the major cell types were exclusive to pustules. Sufficient tissue specimens for spatial transcriptomics were available from four of the volunteers. T- and NK-like cells were highly associated with multiple antigen presentation cell types. In pustules, type I interferon stimulation was high in areas that were high in antigen presentation-especially in macrophages near the abscess-compared to wounds. Together, our data provide a high-resolution view of the cellular immune response to the infection of the skin with a human pathogen.IMPORTANCEA high-resolution view of the immune infiltrate due to infection with an extracellular bacterial pathogen in human skin has not yet been defined. Here, we used the human skin pathogen Haemophilus ducreyi in a human challenge model to identify on a single cell level the types of cells that are present in volunteers who fail to spontaneously clear infection and form pustules. We identified 13 major cell types. Immune cells and immune-activated stromal cells were enriched in pustules compared to wounded (mock infected) sites. Pustules formed despite the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and type I interferon. Interferon stimulation was most evident in macrophages, which were proximal to the abscess. The pro-inflammatory response within the pustule may be tempered by regulatory T cells and cells that express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, leading to failure of the immune system to clear H. ducreyi.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical syndrome with a mortality rate of up to 40%, and it is characterized by a prominent inflammatory cascade. The inflammasome and pyroptosis play crucial regulatory roles in regulating various inflammatory-related diseases by serving as pivotal signaling platforms for inflammatory responses and mediating the release of substantial quantities of inflammatory factors. Our previous studies confirmed that GC-1, a clinical-stage thyroid hormone analog, effectively mitigated pulmonary fibrosis by restoring mitochondrial function in epithelial cells. However, the potential effects of GC-1 on macrophage inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis in lung injury as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. Methods: The effects of GC-1 on lung injury, oxidative damage and inflammation were evaluated in two murine models of ALI (LPS-or HCl-induced models) by assessing lung pathology, the concentrations of IL-1 β and IL-18 in BAL fluid, inflammasome and the levels of inflammasome-and pyroptosis-related proteins. Additionally, the impact of GC-1 on ROS-mediated inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis was investigated by examining ROS levels, Nrf2 signaling, and inflammasome adaptor protein ASC levels in mouse alveolar macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages treated with LPS and ATP. The Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 and the mitochondrial-ROS inhibitor Mito-TEMPO were used to further elucidate the effect of GC-1 on the Nrf2-p53-ASC pathway. Results: GC-1 significantly alleviated inflammation and lung injury in ALI model mice, as indicated by pulmonary pathology, inflammatory cytokine levels, ROS production and pyroptosis rates. Consistently, GC-1 inhibited ASC recruitment and oligomerization in macrophages, which suppressed the gasdermin D-mediated release of IL-1 β and IL-18. These findings indicated a reduction in inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis initiation. Further research revealed that GC-1 may mitigate oxidative stress induced by mitochondrial damage through Nrf2 signaling, thereby inhibiting the expression of ROS-activated p53 and the target gene ASC. This protective effect of GC-1 could be reversed by ML385 and mimicked by Mito-TEMPO. Conclusions: This study presents a novel mechanism for treating ALI in which GC-1 inhibits macrophage ROS-mediated inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis through Nrf2-p53-ASC pathway. These findings highlight the promising potential of the use of GC-1 as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drug in the treatment of ALI/ARDS.">

        <tr id="The interface between the brain surface and the adjacent meninges is a selective barrier regulating fluid, protein and immune cell exchange between the CNS and periphery. However, the cell types that form this important interface are not yet fully defined. To address this limitation, we have used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell spatial transcriptomics together with morphological lineage tracing and immunostaining to analyze the adult murine cortex. We show that the cortical interface is comprised of three major cell types, leptomeningeal cells, border astrocytes and tissue-resident macrophages. On the peripheral side the interface is comprised of transcriptionally-distinct PDGFRα-positive leptomeningeal mesenchymal cells that are intermingled with macrophages. This leptomeningeal pial layer is lined by a population of transcriptionally-distinct border astrocytes. The interface neighborhood is rich in growth factor mRNAs, including many leptomeningeal ligands predicted to act on both the border astrocytes and macrophages. On the CNS side of the interface is the relatively cell-sparse cortical layer one containing interneurons, microglia, parenchymal astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes. Except for the border astrocytes, layer one cells are not closely-associated with the interface, suggesting that secreted ligands may be the major way the brain interface communicates with the underlying cortical parenchyma. Thus, our data provide a molecular/cellular resource describing the brain interface cell types and their interactions, thereby enabling future studies asking how this distinct cellular compartment regulates CNS:periphery interactions. Significance Statement Recent years have seen significant progress in identifying the diverse cell types within the meningeal space. However, the mechanisms by which these cells interact with glial and neuronal cells in layer one of the adult murine cortex remain poorly understood. During development, communication between radial precursors and meningeal layers is crucial for proper brain formation, but the role of this interaction in adulthood is still unclear. Additionally, how resident immune cells in the leptomeningeal space signal to layer one cortical cells or meningeal mesenchymal cells during homeostasis remains an open question. Understanding the identity, location, and interactions of these cells is essential for unraveling the complex dynamics at this critical brain interface.">

        <tr id="Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are a major cause of morbidity largely due to lack of prevention and inadequate treatments. While mortality from viral CNS infections is significant, nearly two thirds of the patients survive. Thus, it is important to understand how the human CNS can successfully control virus infection and recover. Since it is not possible to study the human CNS throughout the course of viral infection at the cellular level, here we analyzed a non-lethal viral infection in the CNS of nonhuman primates (NHPs). We inoculated NHPs intracerebrally with a high dose of La Crosse virus (LACV), a bunyavirus that can infect neurons and cause encephalitis primarily in children, but with a very low (≤ 1%) mortality rate. To profile the CNS response to LACV infection, we used an integrative approach that was based on comprehensive analyses of (i) spatiotemporal dynamics of virus replication, (ii) identification of types of infected neurons, (iii) spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and (iv) morphological and functional changes in CNS intrinsic and extrinsic cells. We identified the location, timing, and functional repertoire of optimal transcriptional and translational regulation of the primate CNS in response to virus infection of neurons. These CNS responses involved a well-coordinated spatiotemporal interplay between astrocytes, lymphocytes, microglia, and CNS-border macrophages. Our findings suggest a multifaceted program governing an optimal CNS response to virus infection with specific events coordinated in space and time. This allowed the CNS to successfully control the infection by rapidly clearing the virus from infected neurons, mitigate damage to neurophysiology, activate and terminate immune responses in a timely manner, resolve inflammation, restore homeostasis, and initiate tissue repair. An increased understanding of these processes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve outcomes of viral CNS diseases in humans.">

        <tr id="The long-term effects of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations on adaptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several cardiovascular complications, including myocarditis, which can be a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause cardiac muscle inflammation through direct mechanisms, such as viral invasion of myocardial cells, and indirect mechanisms, such as the systemic inflammatory response. Myocarditis can lead to life-threatening electrical dysfunctions and arrhythmias. Although post-infection myocarditis is more common, rare cases of post-vaccination myocarditis have also been reported, especially with mRNA vaccines. However, these post-vaccination cases tend to be mild and self-limiting, with a good response to treatment. Despite the associated risks, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, significantly reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections and related heart complications. It is crucial to continue surveillance and research to better understand the association between COVID-19, myocarditis and sudden cardiac death in the young and improve prevention and intervention strategies. In this literature review, we analyzed the pathogenetic mechanisms and histological features of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 and its vaccination, and focused on the correlation with sudden cardiac death.">

        <tr id="Aims/Purpose: Long COVID is a multi systemic condition that occurs in some patients after acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. It has been hypothesized that endothelial dysfunction might be involved in the disease process. Assessment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) in the retina is a non‐invasive method to measure endothelial function. Briefly, stimulation of the retina with flicker light usually leads to a significant increase in retinal blood flow. This mechanism has been found to be disturbed in diseases that are associated with endothelial dysfunction.In this context, we investigated whether changes in NVC can be found in patients with long COVID compared to healthy subjects.Methods: We included patients who had a previously confirmed COVID‐19 infection and were diagnosed with long COVID according to WHO guidelines. Healthy subjects had no history of COVID‐19 infection and were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 seroprevalence. To assess NVC, diffuse flicker light stimulation was performed over 60s using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA, Imedos, Germany). We calculated the percentage increase in mean vessel diameter of arteries and veins in response to the flicker light relative to the baseline diameter size.Results: Fifteen (15) patients with long COVID and 11 healthy subjects were included in the current study. During stimulation with flicker light, the diameters of retinal arteries and veins significantly increased in patients with long COVID (3.1 ± 3.5% for arteries and 4.8 ± 2.9% for veins, p < 0.001 vs. baseline each). The same was found for healthy controls (increase in arteries: 3.4 ± 3.0%, increase in veins: 4.2 ± 1.8%, p < 0.001 vs. baseline each). No difference between the two groups in the flicker response was observed (p = 0.792 for arteries and p = 0.579 for veins).Conclusions: In our small study, NVC was not altered in patients with long COVID compared to healthy subjects. However, further studies including larger sample sizes are needed to assess vascular issues in long COVID patients to better understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Understanding the behavior of B cells during infection and vaccination is important for determining protective humoral immunity. We evaluated the profile of humoral immunity and B cell pool in individuals who were acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2, recovered from COVID-19, or received two doses of the AZD1222 vaccine. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these individuals were subjected to in vitro stimulation to promote the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and the ELISpot evaluated the abundance of pan and SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1-reactive IgG+ ASC. Stimulated PBMCs were characterized using flow cytometry. Culture supernatants were assessed for soluble B-cell-activating factors. The IgA and IgG for the S1 were evaluated through ELISA. Results: The recovered individuals displayed a robust S1 ASC compared to acute and vaccinated individuals. Although the frequency of total B cells or B cell subsets did not vary among the groups, plasmablast cells were increased in naïve and double-negative B cells in the acute, recovered, and vaccinated individuals. Similar IgA and IgG production appeared to be present in the acute and recovered individuals. During vaccination, more IgG is produced than IgA. In acute patients, BAFF levels were positively correlated with total B cells and IgG+ plasmablast cells but negatively correlated with IgA+ plasmablast cells. Conclusions: Vaccination and natural infection with COVID-19 induce a differential profile and functionality of B cells. We suggest that new vaccines against COVID-19 incorporate molecular adjuvants that regulate B lymphocyte functionality and consider the beneficial aspects of the IgA response in addition to IgG.">

        <tr id="The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection is reported to begin with the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human body through droplets, entering the lungs, and binding to the ACE-2 receptor. Meanwhile, activated macrophages stimulate an immune and inflammatory response, activating the coagulation cascade. This activation in COVID-19 patients can exacerbate the condition and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The coagulation cascade is influenced by the expression of related genes, including F3, F5, F8, F12, F13A1, VWF, THBD, PROC, PROCR, PROS1, SERPINE1, A2M, and PLAUR. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022, with 22 mild COVID-19 cases, 35 moderate-to-severe cases, and 20 healthy control individuals from Dr. M. Djamil Padang General Hospital in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Coagulation gene expression data using the RNA-Seq method with transcriptomic analysis were collected and recorded in transcript per-million (TPM) units. The results showed a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes in moderate-to-severe compared to mild COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The analysis of log2 folds change has a statistically significant increase observed in the expression of coagulation genes and a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes among moderate-to-severe and mild patients, as well as healthy controls. The results underscored the impact of COVID-19 infection on the activity of coagulation cascade genes, which could influence the condition of patients and serve as a reference for therapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction COVID-19 was less severe in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared with Europe and North America. It is unclear whether these differences could be explained immunologically. Here we determined the levels of ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 peptide-specific IFN-{gamma} producing cells, and levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines over the first month of COVID-19 diagnosis among Kenyan COVID-19 patients from urban and rural areas. Methods Between June 2020 and August 2022, we recruited and longitudinally monitored 188 COVID-19 patients from two regions in Kenya, Nairobi (urban, n = 152) and Kilifi (rural, n = 36), with varying levels of disease severity {-}- severe, mild/moderate, and asymptomatic. IFN-{gamma} secreting cells were enumerated at 0-, 7-, 14- and 28-days post diagnosis by an ex vivo enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay following in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with overlapping peptides from several SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A multiplexed binding assay was used to measure the levels of 22 plasma cytokines and chemokines. Results Higher frequencies of IFN-{gamma}-secreting cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides were observed on the day of diagnosis among the asymptomatic compared to the patients with severe COVID-19. Higher concentrations of 17 of the 22 cytokines and chemokines measured were positively associated with severe disease, and in particular interleukin (IL)-8, IL-18 and IL-1ra (p<0.0001), while a lower concentration of SDF-1 was associated with severe disease (p<0.0001). Concentrations of 8 and 16 cytokines and chemokines including IL-18 were higher among Nairobi asymptomatic and mild patients compared to their respective Kilifi counterparts. Conversely, the concentrations for SDF-1 were higher in rural Kilifi compared to Nairobi (p=0.012). Conclusion In Kenya, as seen elsewhere, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were associated with severe COVID-19, while an early IFN-{gamma} cellular response to overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides was associated with reduced risk of disease. Living in urban Nairobi (compared with rural Kilifi) was associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The pathogenesis of Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) following mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. In particular, the involvement of activated mast cells (MC) in the highly angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing small bowel, the largest lymphoid organ, might be significant in PCS pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of activated MC, residual SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and zonulin (a marker for impaired intestinal integrity), in the context of PCS, examining peripheral blood (PB) and terminal ileum (TI) 2 years post-infection. Methods In this cross-sectional, controlled study, paired PB and TI samples were obtained from 21 SARS-CoV-2 convalescents with (PCS+) and 11 without PCS (PCS−). CD117+CD25+ activated MC and residual S protein were assessed using fluorescent immunohistochemistry on sections of the the ileal tissue from the gut. Tryptase, zonulin and S protein were quantified in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry assessed frequencies of T-cells (CD3+CD4+ (TCD4), CD3+CD8+ T-cells (TCD8)) and CCR7±CD27± memory subsets (TCM: T central memory, TEM: T effector memory) on mononuclear cells of PB and TI. Results Among PCS+ and PCS−, median follow up was 22 and 18 months post-infection, 81% and 73% were female, and 57% and 55% had pre-existing conditions of which arterial hypertension, chronic lung disease and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent. Compared to PCS−, PCS+ expressed significantly more MC (p< 0.0001) in ileal sections, along with elevated levels of tryptase (p=0.0196) and zonulin (p=0.024) in PB. S protein, by contrast, was undetectable in PB of PCS+ and PCS− even 2 years post-infection. In TI however, the frequency of tissue-resident S protein-infected cells was significantly higher in PCS+ compared to PCS− (p=0.0135). Interestingly, systemic tryptase levels correlated positively to elevated TCM in TI (r=0.7407, p=0.0034). Conclusion Elevated MC activity and S protein in the TI, along with increased tryptase and zonulin levels in PB, indicate ongoing immune activation and intestinal damage in the TI of PCS+. Understanding the role of tissue-resident MC in PCS pathogenesis could lead to targeted therapies. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a respiratory disease that can range in presentation from mild symptoms to severe conditions such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus, spreads through aerosols and respiratory droplets. It enters human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, leading to various complications, including significant alterations in red blood cells and potential disruptions in haemoglobin function and oxygen transport. During infection, the interaction between hypoxia, inflammation, and haematopoiesis affects erythropoiesis at multiple levels. Hypoxia and inflammation, resulting from lung complications and a reduced red blood cell count, influence the regulation of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron levels in the blood. Elevated hepcidin levels are associated with hypoxia and the suppression of erythroferrone, a hormone that normally inhibits hepcidin production. Despite high levels of inflammation, patients in intensive care units often exhibit elevated ferritin levels, which, rather than indicating low hepcidin, suggest disrupted iron metabolism and the development of severe anaemia. Iron is kept in stores, likely due to paradoxically high hepcidin levels, which explains the elevated ferritin measurements. An increase in immature blood cells and a decrease in CD71+ erythroid cells are observed. The elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells highlight their dual role in modulating hyper-inflammation and immune response during disease progression. This review examines the pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 affects red blood cell production and the haematopoietic system and how it triggers cytokine storms through interleukins, immature blood cells, and CD71+ erythroid cells. Understanding these processes provides novel pathways for managing haematological manifestations and immune responses in patients with COVID-19.">

COVID-19 is known to affect both the respiratory, digestive, excretory, and nervous systems. The incidence of chronic effects of the novel coronavirus infection is now on the rise. This paper is aimed to review the epidemiology, pathogenesis and components of post-COVID asthenia. Material and methods. Sixty-three references published between 2005 and 2023 and indexed in the PubMed, CyberLeninka, Russian Citation Index, Semantic Scholar, and Google Scholar databases were included in this review. Results. The study revealed the most common symptoms of post-COVID asthenia are fatigue, muscle weakness, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anxiety or depression, impaired memory and cognitive functions (“foggy brain”), hyposmia, and reduced work performance. One of the specific symptom complexes for post-COVID is asthenovegetative syndrome, the incidence of which according to the meta-analysis ranged from 13.1 to 72.8 %, with a cumulative percentage of 45 ± 0.05 % (95 % confidence interval 0.31–0.54). Conclusions. Nowadays, post-COVID asthenia is becoming extremely severe. It is necessary to review in detail the available data on the epidemiology and components of post-COVID asthenia in order to develop an adequate strategy for post-COVID management.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has presented formidable challenges to global health since its emergence in late 2019. While primarily known for respiratory symptoms, it can also affect the ocular surface. This review summarizes the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on ocular surface immunity and inflammation, focusing on infection mechanisms, immune responses, and clinical manifestations. Ocular symptoms, though uncommon, include conjunctivitis, dry eye, and blurred vision. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in ocular surface epithelial cells, facilitating viral entry, replication, and local dissemination. The innate immune responses involving corneal epithelial cells and immune cells are discussed, alongside mechanisms of antigen presentation and adaptive immunity. The review also examines the roles of cytokines and chemokines in mediating ocular surface inflammation and explores the impact of cytokine storms and chronic inflammation on ocular health. Additionally, the interplay between systemic and ocular immune responses is highlighted, analyzing how systemic COVID-19 inflammation influences ocular surface health. These insights underscore the broader implications of COVID-19 beyond localized ocular infection. By consolidating current findings, this review aims to guide preventive and therapeutic strategies while identifying directions for future research to mitigate the ocular consequences of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in nearly 630 million cases and 6.60 million fatalities globally, as of November 2022. SARS-CoV-2, a species of the Coronaviridae family, has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome as well as four main structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) required for viral entrance into target cells. The spike protein (S) influences this entry through interactions with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized numerous variants of concern (VOCs) that involve Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, having multiple mutations within the spike protein, altering infection rates and immunity evasion. The Omicron variant, featuring 50 mutations, mainly within the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), has a higher transmission rate as compared to other variants. This study focused on two recent Omicron subvariants, XBB.1.5 and CH.1.1, which are known for their high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor. Utilizing an in silico strategy, a total of 1.65 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to assess the stability as well as binding details of these subvariants along with the wild-type Omicron variants. The comprehensive structural stability of the spike protein–hACE2 complexes was evaluated by using numerous parameters including root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, the binding free energies have been determined using the MM-GBSA approach to provide insights into the binding affinities of these variants. Evaluation revealed that the unbound mutant frameworks (SM and TM) displayed higher degrees of instability in comparison to the wild-type (WT) Omicron variant. In contrast, the WT–hACE2 of the Omicron variant complex was less stable than the subvariants, SM–hACE2 and TM–hACE2 complexes. Binding free energy calculations employing MM-PBSA disclosed higher binding energy values for the SM–hACE2 and TM–hACE2 complexes, suggesting a more stable and ordered binding interaction. The observed increase in transmissibility of the new XBB.1.5 and CH.1.1 subvariants, in comparison to the wild-type Omicron, appears to be due to this greater stability and ordered binding.">

        <tr id="Introduction Despite the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, inflammatory and/or thrombotic episodes have been reported. Since the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the endothelium remains uncertain, our objective was to assess endothelial activation status before and 90 days after the third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Methods A prospective longitudinal study was conducted at University General Hospital of Albacete, involving 38 healthy health-care workers. Serum levels of endothelial markers (endocan and sVCAM-1) and spike S1-specific IgG antibodies were determined before and at 7, 15, 24 and 90days following vaccination. To analyze each participant´s individual response, we calculated relative increases/decreases (delta values) in endothelial markers and antibodies concentrations compared to their pre-vaccination levels. Results We identified two significantly distinct profiles of endothelial markers response, characterized by either increased or decreased serum levels of endocan and sVCAM. Incremental and decremental response groups did not differ in terms of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and influenza vaccine co-administration. However, these responses were significantly associated with the relative spike-specific antibody production. Specifically, the greatest relative increase in antibodies was found in the decremental responders. Additionally, the higher delta antibody production was observed in non-previously infected individuals Conclusion Administration of the BNT162b2 booster vaccine triggered a non-homogenous response of endothelial function markers among the study participants. Our findings improve the understanding of individual responses to the mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine, which could be useful in assessing the need for booster doses, particularly in population at risk of vascular complications.">

        <tr id="Oligodendroglia are the responsible cells for myelination in the central nervous system and their involvement in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is poorly understood. We performed snRNA-seq and image-based spatial transcriptomics of human caudate nucleus and putamen (dorsal striatum) from PD and Control brain donors to elucidate the diversity of oligodendroglia and how they are affected by the disease. We have defined fifteen subclasses, from precursor to mature cells, four of which are disease-associated. These PD-specific populations are characterized by the overexpression of heat shock proteins and distinct expression signatures, including immune responses and myelination alterations. We have also identified disruptions in cell communication and oligodendrocyte development, evidenced by changes in neurotransmitter receptors expression and cell adhesion molecules. These transcriptomic changes correlated with impaired myelin integrity and altered oligodendrocyte distribution in the striatum. Thus, we uncover oligodendroglia as a critical cell type in PD and a potential new therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is associated with respiratory disease in children. Between 2014 and 2018, biennial EV-D68 outbreaks coincided with peaks of a polio-like neurologic condition called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). We hypothesized that specific mutations within the currently circulating B3 clade of EV-D68 impacted neurovirulence. However, recovery of these strains from infectious clones by published methods proved unsuccessful. Therefore, we tested different cell lines, reagents, and conditions to enhance efficiency of recombinant (r)EV-D68 rescue. In this study, we present a tractable rescue system to define virulence determinants in B3 clade strains. Using this approach, we successfully rescued historic and contemporary rEV-D68 strains to high titer after limited cell culture passage. All strains in our study replicated efficiently in the parental RD cell line and in human respiratory epithelial cell lines, with BEAS-2B cells exhibiting greater permissivity than A549 cells. While B2 and B3 clade strains could infect the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, the neurovirulent B2 clade strain rUSA/IL/2014-18952 was more dependent on neuron differentiation than B3 clade strains and replication was not sustained under multi-cycle growth conditions. Conversely, replication of rUSA/IL/2014-18952 was more efficient in human spinal cord organoids, which model the cellular heterogeneity of the spinal cord, while replication of B3 clade strains was more modest. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed infection, with viral antigen colocalized with neurons. These findings suggest shifting dynamics of EV-D68 neurovirulence and provide a critical platform for further assessment of viral determinants of neurovirulence in B3 clade strains. IMPORTANCE Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) can cause acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a debilitating neurological condition of the spinal cord in children. Identifying viral determinants of EV- D68 neuropathogenesis is critical to understanding recent shifts in AFM prevalence; however, these investigations are limited to a small subset of infectious clones distantly related to currently circulating B3 clade strains. In this study, we leverage improved rescue strategies to characterize recombinant (r)EV-D68 strains from the dominant B3 clade. While all rEV-D68 replicate efficiently in the parental cell line and in human respiratory epithelial cells, B3 clade strains achieved greater titers in cultured neurons than a neurovirulent B2 clade strain, with less dependence on neuronal differentiation state. All B3 clade strains established infection in human spinal cord organoids, but replication varied between strains. Therefore, our study presents a tractable rescue system to begin to dissect viral determinants of shifting neurotropism within contemporary EV-D68 clades.">

        <tr id="Persistent Covid (PC) represents a post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by symptoms that persist for more than 12 weeks after the acute phase. These symptoms, which include chronic fatigue, respiratory distress, cognitive dysfunction, and other multisystem effects, significantly impact the quality of life of the affected individuals. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood, although studies have suggested a multifactorial origin. Proposed factors include viral persistence, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation disturbances, and gut dysbiosis. The identification of these mechanisms could facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, opening new perspectives for the effective management of persistent Covid. The diagnosis of PC is complex due to the diversity of symptoms and the lack of specific biomarkers. At present, therapeutic approaches focus primarily on symptomatic relief, but further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying PC and to develop targeted interventions.

        <tr id="Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease, characterized by impaired wound repair, tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Immune system may participate in the development and progression of the disease as indicated by altered activity in IPF sufferers. This study investigates the immune response to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in patients with IPF compared to healthy controls, with a particular focus on evaluation of antibody responses, interferon-gamma release, cytokine profiling and a broad panel of immune cell subpopulations. IPF patients without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 had undetectable levels of anti-N IgG antibodies, highlighting their lack of previous infection. After vaccination, IPF patients showed a significant increase in anti-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies, though their levels were lower compared to healthy controls and convalescent IPF patients. Additionally, IPF patients exhibited altered proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T lymphocytes (Teffs) before and after vaccination. Specifically, IPF patients had higher percentages of Tregs with a Th2 phenotype and Th17 Tregs, along with reduced proportions of Th1/17 Tregs. Teffs in IPF patients showed a decrease in Th1-like and Th2-like populations after vaccination. Moreover, IPF patients demonstrated elevated populations of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc) before vaccination and increased levels of γδ Tc cells throughout the study. Alterations in cytokine profiles were also observed, IPF patients showed higher levels of IL-6 and IL-22 compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest a distinct immune response in IPF patients to the COVID-19 vaccine, characterized by differences in antibody production, T cell differentiation and cytokine secretion compared to healthy individuals.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses cause nearly 1 billion global infections annually and are associated with a diverse array of human illnesses. Among these, myocarditis and the resulting chronic inflammation have been recognized as major contributing factors to virus-induced heart failure. Despite our growing understanding, very limited therapeutic strategies have been developed to address the pathological consequences of virus-induced chronic innate immune activation. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was used as a model cardiotropic enterovirus. We leveraged in vitro cell-based studies to investigate cardiomyocyte and macrophage interaction during CVB3 infection, as well as animal studies and unique human cardio specimens to evaluate mechanisms of viral heart injury. We present evidence that viral myocarditis is in part exacerbated by pathological activation of the complement pathway in cells, mice, and human cardiac tissues. We demonstrate unique cell type-specific responses to viral infection that are exacerbated by mitochondrial injury in cardiomyocytes and NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in macrophages. Macrophages are robustly activated by damage-associated mitochondrial components, including mitochondrial proteins and lipid extracts. Mechanistically, we identify complement protective factors CD59/protectin and CD55/DAF as novel targets of viral proteinase that acts to release the brakes on complement-mediated autoinjury. Collectively, our study highlights a novel mechanism that can act as a potential contributor to CVB3 pathogenesis through mitochondrial injury-mediated autoimmunity.


IMPORTANCE
This study sheds light on how enteroviruses, specifically coxsackievirus B3, may contribute to heart failure by triggering harmful immune responses in the heart. We discovered that viral infections in heart cells cause mitochondrial damage, which in turn activates a destructive immune response involving the complement system. This immune activation is one of the significant contributors that lead to further injury of heart tissues, worsening the damage caused by the virus. Additionally, we identified key protective molecules that are targeted and disrupted by the virus, allowing the immune system to attack the heart even more aggressively. Understanding these mechanisms may provide additional insights into how viral infections can lead to chronic heart conditions and suggests potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reduce heart damage in patients affected by viral myocarditis.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVES
The present study evaluated the relationships of the serum levels of the cyclic dinucleotide 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) marker of activation of pattern-recognition receptors with immunoglobulin G antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome-linked coronavirus (IgG-SARS)-positive status and endothelial dysfunction.


METHODS
Selected groups from two cohorts (cohort 1 of 307 healthy volunteers and cohort 2 of 218 coronary heart disease [CHD] patients). COVID-19 infection was confirmed by detection of IgG-SARS against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein receptor-binding domain. Cohort 1 was examined for systematic coronary risk evaluation by European Society of Cardiology (SCORE) starting from 2019 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cohort 2 was processed starting from 2017 (three years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic) in a hospital setting to undergo coronary angiography to assess coronary lesions as Gensini score. The levels of cGAMP and endothelial markers (nitrate and nitrite combined as NOx and endothelin-1) were assessed in the serum to evaluate the associations with IgG-SARS status, SCORE, and extent of coronary lesions by correlation and receiver operating characteristic analyses.


RESULTS
Serum cGAMP did not discriminate between SARS-positive and SARS-negative healthy subject of cohort 1. Moreover, the level of cGAMP was not associated with endothelial biomarkers in healthy subjects. However, Serum cGAMP was associated with atherosclerosis, with area under the curve 0.69 (95 % CI 0.587-0.806; p=0.001), and with endothelial markers in cohort 2.


CONCLUSIONS
Low cGAMP was associated with atherosclerosis in CHD patients, suggesting that cGAMP is a new biomarker in the context of sterile inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 global pandemic, leads to a wide variety of responses among patients. Some of them present a very severe phenotype, while others only experience mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. This differential prognosis is tightly related to the inflammatory status of the patient. Although WHO declared the end of the emergency, the pandemic caused a great socio-sanitary impact in all countries. Thus, the possible outbreak of new biological diseases in the future makes it necessary to deepen the knowledge of this uncontrolled immune response and look for reliable biomarkers to help us predict its potential health impact. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) as lipoxins are endogenous mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid in the resolution stage of any inflammatory process. These lipids have pro-resolving actions in several pathological models, including reducing NF-κB-mediated inflammation, and inducing the antioxidant response through the Nrf-2 pathway. Thus, although a potential relationship has already been suggested between low levels of SPMs and COVID-19 severity, their true role as a predictive biomarker is still unknown. Methods and results In this study, we have analyzed by ELISA the serum levels of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in a representative Spanish cohort. We found reduced levels in deceased patients when compared to mild or severe patients, concomitant with a decrease in the LXA4 biosynthetic pathway and an increase in its degradation pathway. Furthermore, we have studied the correlation between the levels of this SPM and several pathology indicators, finding a significant correlation between increased LXA4 levels and a better prognosis of the patients. Conclusion We propose to measure systemic LXA4 as a new promising biomarker to predict the survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and presumably to other viruses that can affect humanity in the future.">

        <tr id="CNS-resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells populate the haematoma in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), but the contribution of these cell populations to injury and repair has been controversial. To better characterise myeloid cell changes over time, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a unique paired dataset of live haematoma and peripheral blood samples from 10 ICH patients. This work presents a temporal atlas of ICH myeloid populations and identifies population-specific in-situ transcriptional drivers. In addition to distinct populations of activated microglia and TNF-low microglia, we found a unique and highly activated population of CD14+ monocytes in the haematoma. Perturbation analysis comparing haematoma-associated monocytes to shared populations in blood and haematomas identified TNF signalling as the primary driver of their activation. Employing a custom temporal trajectory analysis based on the embeddings of a single-cell foundation model, we found that this TNF response in monocytes was transient, peaking early after haemorrhage and decreasing over the ensuing 48 hours. Our analysis further identified a transient population of highly activated microglia as the likely source of TNF during the acute stage of ICH. Acute TNF signalling in CD14+ monocytes associated with better adjusted outcomes both in our and external cohorts. Overall, our results suggest that acute TNF signalling between transient populations of activated microglia and unique haematoma-associated monocytes could potentially be beneficial in recovery after ICH.

        <tr id="The pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is characterized by a complex of interactions within viral factors, abnormal haemostasis, dysfunction of endothelial cells, and inflammatory reactions, necessitating the research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. Severe COVID-19 conditions are frequently coupled with an increased immunological response, dubbed a cytokine storm, which facilitates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha). The cytokine storm contributes to widespread inflammation and endothelial activation, disrupting the balance between pro-coagulant and anticoagulant factors. Additionally, it is capable of being transmitted by contacting surfaces that are contaminated and then rubbing the face. Biomarkers such as D-dimer levels serve as valuable tools in risk assessment and monitoring, yet their interpretation requires careful consideration within the clinical context. Although some COVID-19 patients may not exhibit any symptoms, they can still spread the virus to others, and there is proof that the virus can spread via the air in some environments, especially confined areas with inadequate ventilation. Vaccines have been developed and deployed globally to prevent COVID-19 infection and reduce severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. Governments and health authorities worldwide have implemented policies including lockdowns, social isolation, mask-wearing, investigation, contact tracking, and vaccination campaigns to control transmission and reduce the impact of the virus. Data were sorted from PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer, Nature, Tailor and Francis, MDPI, BMC and some other related data. This review provides appreciable information on the pathophysiology, management and therapeutic challenges of coagulopathy in Covid-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can lead to a variety of clinical outcomes, including severe congenital abnormalities. The phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors AXL and TIM-1 are recognized as critical entry factors for ZIKV in vitro. However, it remains unclear if and how ZIKV regulates these receptors during infection. In this study, we investigated AXL and TIM-1 expression in human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells, glioblastoma U87 cells, and embryonic stem cells-derived trophoblast following ZIKV infection. We found that both the Asian strain FSS13025 and the African strain MR766 of ZIKV downregulate AXL, with a milder effect on TIM-1. We identified several ZIKV proteins, notably envelope (E), NS2A, NS3, and NS4B, that contribute to this downregulation. Notably, treatment with lysosomal inhibitor NH4Cl or the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) mitigated the AXL/TIM-1 downregulation, indicating autophagy’s involvement in the process. Importantly, this downregulation facilitates sustained viral replication and promotes viral spread by preventing superinfection and limiting cell death, which is also associated with impaired innate immune signaling. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which ZIKV downregulates entry factors to enhance prolonged viral replication and spread. AUTHOR SUMMARY Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with severe birth defects, yet the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors AXL and TIM-1 and discovered that they promote ZIKV entry but are downregulated by the virus infection. We identified several ZIKV proteins involved in AXL and TIM-1 down-regulation through an autophagy-mediated process. Mechanistically, this loss of surface receptors protects host cells from superinfection and cell death, while dampening the innate immune response, ultimately promoting viral spread. Our results contribute to a better understanding of ZIKV’s interactions with host cells and offer insight into viral entry, innate signaling, and pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of long COVID (LC) still presents many areas of uncertainty. This leads to difficulties in finding an effective specific therapy. We hypothesize that the key to LC pathogenesis lies in the presence of chronic functional damage to the main anti-inflammatory mechanisms of our body: the three reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis, and the mitochondrial redox status. We will illustrate that this neuro-endocrine-metabolic axis is closely interconnected and how the SARS-CoV-2 can damage it at all stages through direct, immune-inflammatory, epigenetic damage mechanisms, as well as through the reactivation of neurotropic viruses. According to our theory, the direct mitochondrial damage carried out by the virus, which replicates within these organelles, and the cellular oxidative imbalance, cannot be countered in patients who develop LC. This is because their anti-inflammatory mechanisms are inconsistent due to reduced vagal tone and direct damage to the endocrine glands of the HPA axis. We will illustrate how acetylcholine (ACh) and cortisol, with its cytoplasmatic and cellular receptors respectively, are fundamental players in the LC process. Both Ach and cortisol play multifaceted and synergistic roles in reducing inflammation. They achieve this by modulating the activity of innate and cell-mediated immunity, attenuating endothelial and platelet activation, and modulating mitochondrial function, which is crucial for cellular energy production and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In our opinion, it is essential to study the sensitivity of the glucocorticoids receptor in people who develop LC and whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause long-term epigenetic variations in its expression and function.">

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="It is becoming more broadly accepted that human-based models are needed to better understand the complexities of the human nervous system and its diseases. The recently developed human brain organotypic culture model is one highly promising model that requires the involvement of neurosurgeons and neurosurgical patients. Studies have investigated the electrophysiological properties of neurons in such ex vivo human tissues, but the maintenance of other cell types within explanted brain remains largely unknown. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we systematically evaluate the transcriptional identities of the various cell types found in six patient samples after fourteen days in culture (83,501 nuclei from day 0 samples and 45,738 nuclei from day 14 samples). We used two pediatric temporal lobectomy samples, an adult frontal cortex sample, two IDH wild-type glioblastoma samples, and one medulloblastoma sample. We found remarkably high correlations of day 14 transcriptional identities to day 0 tissue, especially in tumor cells (r = 0.90 to 0.93), though microglia (r = 0.86), oligodendrocytes (r = 0.80), pericytes (r = 0.77), endothelial cells (r = 0.78), and fibroblasts (r = 0.76) showed strong preservation of their transcriptional profiles as well. Astrocytes and excitatory neurons showed more moderate preservation (r = 0.66 and 0.47, respectively). Because the main difficulty with organotypic brain cultures is the acquisition of human tissue, which is readily available to neurosurgeons, this model is easily accessible to neurosurgeon-scientists and neurosurgeons affiliated with research laboratories. Broad uptake of this more representative model should prompt advances in our understanding of many uniquely human diseases, lead to more reliable clinical trial performance, and ultimately yield better therapies for our patients.">

        <tr id="HERVs (Human endogenous retroviruses) are remnants of ancient exogenous retroviruses that have integrated into the human genome, particularly in germ-line cells. Among these, the envelope protein gene HERV-W env (Human endogenous retroviruses W family envelope protein), located on chromosome 7 and primarily expressed in the human placenta, has been closely linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, as well as autoimmune diseases and cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the abnormal expression of cytokines as a key factor in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Notably, elevated serum levels of IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta) in schizophrenia, a cytokine associated with inflammation, are a characteristic feature of pyroptosis—a form of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death. Although previous research has observed significant upregulation of pyroptosis-related genes such as CASP1 (Caspase-1), NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3), and IL1B (interleukin 1 beta) in the serum of schizophrenia patients, and extensive neuron pyroptosis has been documented in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, the occurrence of neuron pyroptosis in schizophrenia remains uncertain. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying pyroptosis in schizophrenia and its potential connection with HERV-W env have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the expression levels of pyroptosis-related genes, specifically CASP1, GSDMD (Gasdermin D), and IL1B, were significantly elevated in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between HERV-W env expression and the levels of CASP1/GSDMD/IL1B in these patients. Experimental evidence further demonstrated that HERV-W env promoted the activation of Caspase-1 and the cleavage of Gasdermin D, leading to increased release of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and IL-1β. Importantly, inhibitors targeting NLRP3, CASP1, and GSDMD significantly reduced the releases of LDH and IL-1β induced by HERV-W env, whereas BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) inhibitors did not have a notable effect. This suggests that HERV-W env induces CASP1–GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis through the NLRP3–CASP1–GSDMD signaling pathway. As pyroptosis is increasingly recognized for its connection to neurodegenerative diseases, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal pyroptosis mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of HERV-W env. Additionally, it explores the potential facilitation of HERV-W env in the development of schizophrenia via pyroptosis, proposing that certain pyroptosis indicators could serve as potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. Based on our existing research results and the findings of previous researchers, we infer that HERV-W env acts as a bridge in the onset and progression of schizophrenia. Furthermore, HERV-W env may serve as a potential target for the clinical treatment of schizophrenia, suggesting that monoclonal antibody therapy targeting HERV-W env could represent a novel approach to managing this disease.">

We investigated relationships between mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific interferon- gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) T-cell responses and neutralizing antibody development in long-term care home staff doubly vaccinated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. The impacts of pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity on cellular and humoral responses to vaccination were additionally assessed. Mathematical modeling of the kinetics of spike-specific IFN-γ and IL-2 T-cell responses over 6 months post-second dose was bifurcated into recipients who exhibited gradual increases with doubling times of 155 and 167 days or decreases with half-lives of 165 and 132 days, respectively. Differences in kinetics did not correlate with clinical phenotypes. Serological anti-spike IgG, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, anti-spike IgA, and anti-RBD IgA antibody levels otherwise decayed in all participants with half-lives of 63, 57, 79, and 46 days, respectively, alongside waning neutralizing capacity (t1/2 = 408 days). Spike-specific T-cell responses induced at 2-6 weeks positively correlated with live viral neutralization at 6 months post-second dose, especially in hybrid immune individuals. Participants with pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 exhibited greater spike-specific T-cell responses, reduced anti-RBD IgA antibody levels, and a trending increase in neutralization at 2-6 weeks post-second dose. Non-spike-specific T-cells predominantly targeted SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein at 6 months post-second dose in cross-reactive participants. mRNA vaccination was lastly shown to induce off-target T-cell responses against unrelated antigens. In summary, vaccine-induced spike-specific T-cell immunity appeared to influence serological neutralizing capacity, with only a modest effect induced by pre-existing cross-reactivity.


IMPORTANCE
Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential contributions of mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific T-cell responses to the durability of neutralizing antibody levels in both uninfected and hybrid immune recipients. Our study additionally sheds light on the precise impacts of pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on the magnitude and kinetics of cellular and humoral responses to vaccination. Accordingly, our data will help optimize the development of next-generation T cell-based coronavirus vaccines and vaccine regimens to maximize efficacy and durability.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with the development of fetal complications such as microcephaly. We have recently demonstrated that palmitoleate protects against ZIKV-induced apoptosis in placental trophoblasts. In the present study, we hypothesize that palmitoleate prevents ZIKV infection-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in neurons. Neurons were infected with 0.1-1 multiplicity of infection of recombinant MR766 or PRVABC59 strains of ZIKV for an hour followed by treatment of palmitoleate (100 µM-200 µM) for different post-infection time points. Apoptosis was measured by nuclear morphological changes, caspase 3/7 activity, and immunoblot analysis of pro-apoptotic mediators. Activation of ER stress markers and viral envelope levels were detected using qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Infectious virus particles were measured by using plaque assay. ZIKV infection to neuronal cells showed increased levels of pro-apoptotic markers like cleaved-PARP, cleaved caspase-3, Bim, and Puma, whereas decreased levels of anti-apoptotic markers such as Mcl-1, Bcl-1, and Bcl-xL. Further, we observed activation of three arms of ER stress namely: inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1), protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor (ATF6) pathways with ZIKV infection. Treatment of palmitoleate dramatically decreased ZIKV infection-induced increase in percent apoptotic nuclei and caspase 3/7 activity. Further, treatment of palmitoleate decreased cleaved PARP and PUMA protein expressions. Treatment of palmitoleate reduced ZIKV-induced ER stress activation as evidenced by decreased levels of phosphorylated forms of IRE1 and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha; decreased expressions of cleaved ATF6, spliced X-box associated protein 1 and C/EBP homologous protein compared to ZIKV infection alone. Further, treatment of palmitoleate attenuated ZIKV envelope levels and infectious titer in SH-SY5Y and primary fetal cortical neurons isolated from humanized STAT2 knockin mice. These data suggest that palmitoleate supplementation protects against ZIKV-induced neuronal ER stress, apoptosis and decreases Zika viral load thereby mitigates neuronal damage.">

Although, SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals often show no or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Although SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been responsible for pneumonia,
recent studies indicate that it also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain, among other vital organs.
Evidence suggests that this virus may travel retrogradely from the olfactory epithelium to brain
stem sections, causing neurological impairments in a significant number of individuals. Individuals
with severe COVID-19 frequently have elevated cytokines that promote inflammation and acute
respiratory failure and require frequent supportive ventilation. These factors are believed to contribute
to cognitive deterioration. Severe neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients include- paralysis,
stroke, cranial nerve deficits, delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, and meningitis. The virus, with
its unique structure, and a high binding affinity for the human enzyme ACE2 (used as an entry point
by the virus), contributes significantly to its deadly nature. Furthermore, to address the outbreak effectively,
researchers worldwide must develop precise treatment strategies. Advancing new diagnostic
and treatment methods to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on cognition requires further
epidemiological research and clinical experience. Additionally, by understanding the virus's
impact on cognitive functions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted treatments to alleviate
these severe neurological consequences.

        <tr id="A positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that devastated the world. While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID- 19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Rickettsia spp. cause life-threatening diseases in humans. The fundamental pathophysiological changes in fatal rickettsial diseases are disrupted endothelial barrier and increased microvascular permeability. However, it remains largely unclear how rickettsiae induce microvascular endothelial injury. In the present study, we demonstrated that Rickettsia conorii infection disrupts the continuous immunofluorescence expression of the interendothelial tight junction protein, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), in infected monolayers of microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs), accompanied by significantly diminished total expression levels of ZO-1. Interestingly, R. conorii activated inflammasome in MVECs, as evidenced by cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1β in the cell lysates in association with significantly elevated expression levels of nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin containing protein 3 (NLRP3). Furthermore, selective inhibition of NLRP3 by MCC950 significantly suppressed the activation and cleavage of caspase-1 induced by R. conorii in endothelial cells, which further prevented the disruption of interendothelial junctions and reduction of ZO-1 expression. Of note, pharmaceutical inhibition of NLRP3 mitigated the disrupted endothelial integrity caused by R. conorii, measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran passage in a Transwell assay, independent of bacterial growth and cellular cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results suggest that R. conorii affected microvascular endothelial junction integrity likely via diminishing and interrupting the junctional protein ZO-1 in association with activating NLRP3 inflammasome. These data not only highlight the potential of ZO-1 as a biomarker for Rickettsia-induced microvascular injury but also provide insight into targeting NLRP3 inflammasome/ZO-1 signaling as a potentially adjunctive therapeutic approach for severe rickettsioses.">

        <tr id="Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is the leading cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis worldwide. The neuroimmune interactions between peripheral and central immune systems in angiostrongyliasis remain unclear. In this study, significant infiltration of eosinophils, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and Ly6C monocytes is observed in the brains of AC-infected mice, with macrophages being the most abundant. RNA-seq and SMART-seq analysis of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and DNA sensor gene sets revealed a marked increase in Z-DNA binding protein 1 (Zbp1) expression in infected mice. Confocal microscopy, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry further confirmed that Zbp1 is specifically upregulated in macrophages and microglia. Using Zbp1-knockout mice and flow cytometry, it is found that knockout of Zbp1 enhanced lymphocyte infiltration and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, modulating the immune microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) during AC infection. Mechanistically, it is revealed that in macrophage Zbp1 directly binds to receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) to promote its phosphorylation, subsequently facilitating the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl). The activated Zbp1-pRIP3-pMlkl axis leads to necroptosis and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1α, CXCL9, CXCL10 in macrophages, which recruits and activates immune cells. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of angiostrongyliasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Germ-line deletion of a conserved enhancer (the Fms intrinsic regulatory element, FIRE) in the mouse Csf1r locus causes congenital absence of microglia. Homozygous FIRE deletion on a C57BL/6J background leads to perinatal lethality and hydrocephalus (HC) in surviving pups. We developed a congenic C57BL/6J line with defined regions of non-C57BL/6J genomic DNA, increased postnatal viability and reduced incidence of HC. Both perinatal lethality and HC were eliminated in F2 mice following outcross of the congenic line to CBA/J or BALBc/J backgrounds. To assess the impacts of microglial deficiency in postnatal neurodevelopment we analyzed deep total RNA-seq data from multiple brain regions of wild-type and Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mice. Aside from the loss of microglial-specific transcripts, we found no significant alterations in relative abundance of any cell-type or region-specific transcriptomic signature. Transcripts associated with endosome/lysosome function, which are enriched in microglia, were not affected, suggesting compensatory expression by other cell types. On the C57BL/6J x CBA/J F2 background, congenital absence of microglia did not affect motor activity, behavior or myelination up to 7 months of age but was associated with astrocytosis and calcification in the thalamus. In the congenic C57BL/6J Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mouse line, intraperitoneal transfer of wild-type bone marrow cells (BMT) at weaning led to complete repopulation of the brain with microglia-like cells without giving rise to monocytic intermediates. Our results suggest novel strategies for treatment of microglial deficiency.">

        <tr id="The development of new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic potential of microvascular endothelium. A specific feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the post-COVID syndrome that is characterised by long-term impairment of various organs and systems. The immune pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis requires special attention due to their baseline pro-inflammatory status. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of novel coronavirus infection on the risk of chronic systemic hyper-inflammation and low-grade systemic inflammation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Two main groups consisted of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had survived COVID-19 (mild form) 3 months ago, or at earlier terms, including the subjects with post-COVID symptoms and those free of these symptoms. The comparison group included patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without a history of COVID-19. The control group was presented by healthy blood donors. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFá), D-dimers, troponin I, cortisol, and endothelin I (ET-I) were measured in patients’ plasma by immunoassay technique. On the basis of these markers, we calculated integral indices of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) – the levels of reactivity (RL), and chronic systemic hyper-inflammation (ChSI). Low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) was diagnosed in absence of ChSI, but in cases of simultaneous increase of D-dimer levels 250 ng/ml and ET-I levels 90 pg/ml in the patient. 
The most prevalent symptoms of post-COVID in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were tachycardia, arthralgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, which correspond to the population-wide data. By all empirical parameters, the groups of tuberculosis patients were comparable to each other (p 0.05) and significantly differed from control group. However, evaluation of integral indexes is more crucial for assessing the ‘systemic’ origin of the process. Thus, 23-50% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed subcritical SIR (RL = 1-2), being a feature of ChSI in 7.1-13.6% of cases (both in COVID-19 reconvalescents and non-COVID-19 patients). Meanwhile, all patient groups did not show significant difference in the frequency of LGSI and endothelial dysfunction (p 0.05). However, there was a trend towards an increase of these scores in the following sequence: tuberculosis without COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 + post-COVID syndrome. 
Most patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are not characterized by the development of chronic systemic hyperinflammation. LGSI is the most probable feature of general pathology in tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis infection sufficiently contributes to the development of LGSI, since the frequency and severity of LGSI and its individual manifestations are independent on the new coronavirus infection and signs of post-COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="Flaviviruses represent a serious global health threat, infecting millions annually with high rates of cross-infection among different flaviviruses, yet no broad-spectrum antiviral therapy currently targets these pathogens. Through biological big data analysis, we observed a significant downregulation of Canopy FGF Signaling Regulator 3 (CNPY3), a positive regulator of defense responses, in flavivirus-infected patients, with the level of downregulation correlating with infection severity. This observation was validated in cellular and animal models. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that flaviviruses hijack the RNA-binding protein Human antigen R (HuR) to destabilize CNPY3 mRNA via adenine-uridine-rich elements (AREs), thus downregulating CNPY3 expression and promoting viral replication. Our findings identify CNPY3 as a novel antiviral mediator essential for the TLR-mediated type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway in defense against flaviviruses. In vitro, CNPY3 overexpression reduced DENV and ZIKV replication, confirming its antiviral role. To explore therapeutic potential, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating CNPY3 mRNA (LNP-CNPY3), and early administration in flavivirus-infected mice improved survival, reduced viral loads, and attenuated neuroinflammation by enhancing antiviral and interferon responses. Together, these findings establish CNPY3 as a critical antiviral target and support LNP-CNPY3 as a promising therapeutic approach against flavivirus infections.">

        <tr id="The immune status of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in different stages of infection remains difficult to determine. In this study, we performed high-throughput single-cell mass cytometry on peripheral blood samples from 10 COVID-19 patients and four healthy donors to analyze their immune status at acute and convalescence phases. During the acute stage, the proportion of neutrophils increased significantly while natural killer (NK) cells decreased. In contrast, during the convalescence phase, the proportion of plasma cells decreased from the acute stage of disease onset and was lower than normal. The proportions of B, mast and plasma cell subsets decreased significantly with the process of disease recovery. Further analysis of the subsets of major immune cell types in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations in different stages showed that in the acute stages of disease progression, the T helper cell 1 (Th1), IgD+ B and neutrophil subsets increased in COVID-19 patients, especially in symptomatic patients, while the central memory CD4+T cells (CD4 TCM), mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) and NK cell subsets decreased significantly, especially in symptomatic patients. Then CD4 TCM and MAIT returned to normal levels at the recovery phase. Dynamic assessment displayed that the immune imbalance at the onset of COVID-19 could be corrected during recovery. Our study provides additional information on the immune status of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations in different stages. These findings may provide new insights into COVID-19 immunotherapy and immune intervention.">

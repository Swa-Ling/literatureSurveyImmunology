        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Factors regulating the severity of pneumonitis during viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found higher expression of protein S (PROS1) in lung epithelium of mild compared to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We hypothesized that PROS1 may protect the upper airways by regulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods To test this, in vitro air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary healthy human lung epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2. This model, validated through immunofluorescent staining, confocal microscopy, and single-cell RNA-sequencing, replicated pathogenic changes seen in the lungs of COVID-19. Regulation and secretion of PROS1, along with multiple soluble mediators, were quantified in control and infected cultures using ELISAs. Results We found that PROS1 is present in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium and is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection through an IFN-mediated process. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PROS1 downregulated the SARS-CoV-2-induced proinflammatory phenotypes of basal cells, transforming pathogenic CXCL10/11high into a regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 increased the secretion of M-CSF from epithelial cells, which induced the expression of PROS1 receptor MERTK on monocytes interacting with the lung epithelium. PROS1, in turn, shifted SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenic monocyte phenotypes toward a phenotype with increased MHC class II. Conclusion These findings highlight the crucial role of PROS1 in protecting against severe lung pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2, by reducing epithelial- and monocyte-derived inflammation, promoting pro-repair epithelial phenotypes, and enhancing antigen presentation in myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.">

        <tr id="Background CNS infection by HIV-1 contributes to neuroinflammation, cognitive impairments, and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Although HIV-1 is known to enter the brain early in infection via “Trojan horse” leukocytes, including infected monocytes and CD4+T cells, the specific cellular phenotypes facilitating this process during acute infection remain incompletely characterized. Objective This study aims to characterize the roles of brain lymphocytes during acute infection and primary CD4+ T cell phenotypes seeding the SIV to the CNS. Methods scRNA-seq was performed on brain and blood cells of three acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The transcriptomic data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches and validated through in vitro co-culture assays and re-analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset. Results We found a distinct cell cluster in the brain co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, suggesting brain myeloid cells may engulf CD4+ T cells entering from the blood. This finding was confirmed in by coculture studies of macrophages and T cells, and identified specific chemokines could distinguish such cells. Acute infection induced an increase in proliferating CD4+ cytotoxic-like T cells, which had high expression of viral entry receptors and adhesion molecules, indicating their role in CNS infection. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of cytotoxic genes, MHC class II molecules, ISG15, and USP18 in brain lymphocytes, indicating a robust immune response to acute infection. Conclusion Our findings suggest that CD4+cytotoxic-like T cells represent a key lymphocyte subset responsible for initiating SIV entry into the brain and triggering neuroinflammatory processes. Furthermore, interactions between infiltrating lymphocytes and brain-resident myeloid cells may facilitate viral propagation within the CNS.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, respiratory complications and cognitive dysfunction, affecting approximately 13.5% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Despite its clinical significance, the mechanisms driving PASC remain poorly understood. Here, to address this, we utilized a Phodopus roborovskii hamster model to investigate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with influenza A virus. While 46.25–47.50% of hamsters survived SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus H1N1 infection, 13.75% of SARS-CoV-2 survivors exhibited impaired weight recovery, severe lung pathology and significant neutrophil accumulation, defining the PASC group. Single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung and spleen at 30 days post-infection revealed hallmark PASC gene signatures uniquely upregulated in the PASC group. This was accompanied by elevated neutrophil levels and reduced macrophage populations, indicative of disrupted myeloid cell differentiation. Immunohistochemistry further detected persistent SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit antigen in the lungs of PASC hamsters at 30 days post-infection, coinciding with marked neutrophil infiltration, which probably drove prolonged inflammatory responses. Indeed, the neutrophils in the PASC group exhibited sustained upregulation of inflammation-related genes, including FPR2, MMP9 and S100A9, which are associated with neutrophil degranulation and extracellular trap formation. Importantly, targeting neutrophil-mediated inflammation with small-molecule inhibitors substantially reduced PASC phenotypes. Among these, Sivelestat, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, demonstrated the most pronounced efficacy, reducing PASC incidence and mortality, and markedly reducing neutrophil levels. These findings underscore the critical role of neutrophil activation in driving lung damage and chronic inflammation during PASC, offering promising therapeutic strategies for mitigating long-term COVID-19 sequelae.">

        <tr id="Background: CLEC5A is a C-type lectin expressed by monocytes and neutrophils, playing an important role in innate immunity. Although it has been shown to interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, its role during vaccination remains poorly understood. Methods: To address this question, we combined in vitro assays to characterize CLEC5A and spike expression and their impact on monocyte differentiation and T-cell activation; in vivo studies to evaluate CLEC5A expression, immune responses, and vaccine efficacy in a murine model; and in silico analyses to identify potential spike epitopes and CLEC5A interaction sites. Results: The Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent mRNA vaccine induced spike expression and CLEC5A upregulation in THP-1 monocytes, promoting M1-like differentiation and CD86+ activation. In PBMC co-cultures, CLEC5A+ monocytes acted as antigen-presenting cells, releasing inflammatory chemokines and activating both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, thereby linking CLEC5A expression to adaptive immunity. In mice, CLEC5A expression was observed on inflammatory monocytes (CCR2+CX3CR1low) within two days of vaccination. In vivo, CLEC5A expression increased during SARS-CoV-2 infection and after immunization, but declined following viral challenge in vaccinated animals. Consistently, robust humoral and cellular responses were detected post-immunization. In silico analysis further suggested differential CLEC5A binding across B- and T-cell epitopes within the spike glycoprotein. Conclusions: These findings suggest that CLEC5A may play a role in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Although further studies with different vaccine platforms are necessary to confirm and expand these observations, our results provide preliminary evidence supporting the potential of CLEC5A as an exploratory biomarker of vaccine-induced immunity.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Understanding age-associated differences in acute and memory adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and how this contributes to more favorable outcomes in children is critically important.


METHODS
We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell, B cell, and antibody responses in 329 peripheral blood samples collected from non-hospitalized children, adolescents, and adults at three timepoints, including acute and memory timepoints.


RESULTS
Most children produced robust CD4+ T cell responses during infection and developed memory CD4+ T cells; however, young children <4 years old often had undetectable CD4+ T cell responses compared to older children and adults. Young children also generated reduced frequencies of memory B cells; despite this, they mounted substantial and durable neutralizing antibody responses. CD4+ T cell responses in children were biased towards non-spike epitopes, especially in asymptomatic cases. Memory B cells in children were preferentially classical memory or, paradoxically, CXCR3+.


CONCLUSION
These findings support the concept that the kinetics and composition of T and B cell responses shift across age groups and may be associated with milder COVID-19 outcomes in children.">

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, and accounts for the majority of malaria-associated mortality. Reducing the overwhelming inflammatory responses in the early stage of infection is a key point to prevent death due to CM. In this study, we found that neutrophil mobilization occurred rapidly in response to Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection in a murine CM model. Depletion of neutrophils protected the infected mice from neuropathology, with low infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells in the brain, and attenuated activation of dendritic cell (DC) and parasite-specific T cell responses in the spleen. Flow cytometry analysis showed that following PbA infection the expression of TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 were increased in splenic DC, while only TLR9 expression was reduced after the depletion of neutrophils. To validate the TLR9-dependent activation between neutrophils and DC, we used neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to stimulate bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDC) from WT and Tlr9−/− mice. The results showed that the DNA component of NETs activates DCs through the TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to upregulated expression of costimulatory molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which was abolished by DNase I. BMDC stimulated by NETs promoted CD8+ T cell activation with TLR9 dependence. Inhibiting NETs with Sivelestat effectively impeded the onset and progression of CM in the PbA infected mice. Collectively, our results indicated that neutrophil cell death (NETosis) induced TLR9-dependent DC activation and pathogenic CD8+ T cell responses, revealing that the NETs-TLR9/NF-κB-DC-CD8+ T cell axis may provide novel insights into the immunopathogenic mechanisms of CM.

        <tr id="APOBEC3B (A3B) has been implicated in host–virus interactions, but its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that A3B is overexpressed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from severe COVID-19 patients compared to those with mild disease. A3B knockdown in Caco-2 cells significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, likely through attenuation of the PKR-mediated integrated stress response, a pathway proposed to promote SARS-CoV-2. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data suggest that BALF cells from severe COVID-19 patients exhibit a repressed state for cellular translation, potentially mediated by eIF2α phosphorylation. However, in A549-ACE2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 does not activate PKR, but A3B knockdown still reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action in different cellular contexts. To further investigate A3B’s role in severe COVID-19, we employed Geneformer, a transformer-based machine learning model, which predicted that A3B knockout would perturb AMPD2 (adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2), a key enzyme in purine metabolism and immune regulation. We validated this prediction using bulk RNA-seq and clinical scRNA-seq data, confirming that AMPD2 expression is downregulated in severe COVID-19 but restored upon A3B knockdown. Together, these findings suggest that A3B plays a proviral role in SARS-CoV-2 infection by modulating translational control and immune regulatory networks, warranting further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanistic details.">

        <tr id="Endothelial cells (ECs) act as gatekeepers and signalling hubs that coordinate communication between blood vessels and surrounding tissues by regulating vascular tone, immune responses and numerous other physiological processes. During vascular inflammation commonly associated with aging, atherosclerosis, diabetes and autoimmunity, a range of biological, environmental and physical stressors can induce activation and apoptosis of ECs. Apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) are large (~ 1–5 μm), membrane‑bound extracellular vesicles generated solely through apoptotic cell disassembly, that are increasingly recognised as mediators of intercellular communication via the transfer of bioactive molecules to target cells. Although EC apoptosis is a central feature of vascular inflammatory disorders, the formation of EC‑derived ApoBDs and their immunomodulatory roles when formed in an inflammatory environment, remains poorly defined. This study aimed to characterise the functional properties of EC‑derived ApoBDs generated under inflammatory conditions in vitro. A proteomics analysis of EC‑derived ApoBDs revealed that EC‑ApoBDs generated during inflammation (‘iApoBDs’) were enriched in inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, adhesion molecules and antigen presentation machinery compared with non-inflammatory (‘ApoBD’) controls. Functionally, iApoBDs promoted monocyte chemotaxis via the release of MCP-1, while altered expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 enhanced efferocytosis by macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, iApoBDs generated from antigen-pulsed HUVECs promoted IFN‑𝛾 expression by peptide specific CD8 T cells in an in vitro model of antigen presentation. These findings demonstrate that within an inflammatory setting, apoptotic ECs can participate in continued communication with their environment via the generation of ApoBDs, thereby modulating innate and adaptive immune processes. The formation of ApoBDs by ECs may serve as a target for therapeutic interventions in inflammatory vascular diseases.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a debilitating chronic pain condition following varicella‐zoster virus (VZV) reactivation, characterised by persistent neuroinflammation. However, the intracellular mechanisms that drive microglial activation and sustained pain sensitisation remain poorly understood. Due to mice having no VZV infection receptor, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1) infection is a well‐established PHN mice model. Here, we identified GCN5L1, a mitochondrial acetylation modulator, as a critical regulator of microglial mitochondrial dynamics and a key contributor to PHN pathogenesis. We found that GCN5L1 was markedly upregulated in the spinal dorsal horn after PHN, particularly located in microglia. Microglial Gcn5l1 deficiency attenuated HSV‐1‐induced neuroinflammatory responses and alleviated mechanical allodynia, whereas Gcn5l1 overexpression exacerbated neuroinflammatory responses both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, GCN5L1 promoted mitochondrial fission and impaired oxidative metabolism by enhancing DRP1 acetylation, without altering the expression of canonical fission–fusion regulators. Restoration of mitochondrial fission using MFI8 intrathecally reversed the anti‐inflammatory and analgesic effects of Gcn5l1 deficiency, confirming that GCN5L1 mediated pain sensitisation through mitochondrial fission–fusion in PHN. Finally, inhibiting GCN5L1 by AAV‐shGCN5L1 intrathecally suppressed neuroinflammation and mechanical allodynia in PHN mice. These findings uncovered that GCN5L1 aggravated neuroinflammation and PHN through regulating microglial mitochondrial fission–fusion homeostasis, offering new insights and potential feasibility in clinical translation for PHN management.">

        <tr id="Children with COVID-19 typically experience milder symptoms and lower hospitalization rates, though severe cases do occur. Understanding age-related immune responses is crucial for future preparedness. We characterized immune response dynamics to SARS-CoV-2 in 145 samples from 119 pediatric patients (<18 years) with confirmed infection, assessed at four distinct time points: <14 days, 14 days–3 months, 3–6 months, and 6–12 months post-infection. At infection, patients presented increased activated T-cells, higher levels of exhaustion (i.e., PD-1+), lower numbers of unswitched memory B-cells, and increased antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Both humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses increased over time (all patients showed measurable responses in the last assessment). Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients (58.6%) showed increased specific cellular responses from infection onwards, along with enriched memory B-cell subsets (but not ASCs), and distinct T-cell activation profiles. Children with severe disease were younger, predominantly boys, displayed altered T/B-cell ratios, and reduced PHA responses when infected. Compared to adolescents, younger children showed lower antibody titers and weaker cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2, possibly underlining the higher prevalence of severe manifestations in younger children. Our study illustrates important age-, gender-, and disease severity-dependent variations in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which can be helpful in improving patient management and immunization strategies adjusted to age groups.">

        <tr id="Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with major symptoms including memory and learning deficits. Neuroinflammation associated with reactive microglia promotes AD progression. These reactive microglia secrete prostaglandins, which are synthesized through the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2. Here, we aimed to elucidate the specific mechanisms of COX1 in AD pathogenesis and its interactions with neuroinflammatory processes. Methods We conducted backcrossing between COX-1 knockout (KO) and 5 × FAD mice to evaluate the effect of COX-1 deficiency on neuroinflammation. In addition, single-cell sequencing and microarray datasets from public databases and ingenuity pathway analysis in vitro were employed to explore gene expression profiles in the brains of AD mice. Results We identified a significant upregulation of COX-1 in 5 × FAD mice, with expression specifically localized to microglia in an age-dependent manner. Additionally, COX-1 KO alleviated neuroinflammation and accumulation of Aβ plaques, subsequently improving cognitive behavior in 5 × FAD mice. Moreover, microglia exhibited an amoeboid morphology in 5 × FAD mice, whereas in age-matched 5 × FAD/COX-1 KO mice, microglia had a ramified appearance. Additionally, our study demonstrated a pharmacological approach that inhibits the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)/EP2 receptors via inhibition of the cAMP-PKA-NFκB-p65 pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, producing similar beneficial effects as observed in COX-1 KO mice. Conclusion Our findings indicate that targeting the COX-1/PGE2/EP2 signaling pathway may alleviate neuroinflammation and impede AD progression. Moreover, the EP2 receptor presents a promising pharmacological target for mitigating the pathological effects associated with COX-1 activity in AD patients.

Complications arising from viral infections in these age groups can present therapeutic challenges, as most of these individuals have impaired adaptive immunity. Using the T‐ and B cell‐deficient Rag2−/− mice, the mechanisms that mediate protection in immunocompromised hosts during RSV infection can be investigated. RSV‐infected Rag2−/− mice showed no symptoms of disease or chronic inflammation in the lungs and airways despite the presence of infectious virus in their lungs several months after infection. Interestingly, Natural Killer (NK) cells, the main innate cells with anti‐viral cytotoxic effector functions, were recruited 2 days earlier in the lungs of Rag2−/− mice compared with wildtype mice, resulting in early production of IFN‐γ. However, depletion of NK cells did not affect disease severity or viral load. Together, these results suggest that the NK cells are largely dispensable for virus control during primary RSV infection in Rag2−/− mice.">

        <tr id="The recent COVID-19 pandemic left behind the lingering question as whether new variants of concern might cause further waves of infection. Thus, it is important to investigate the long-term protection gained via vaccination or exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here we compare the evolution of memory T-cell responses following primary infection with subsequent antigen exposures. Single-cell TCR analysis of three dominant SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T-cell responses identifies the dominant public TCRα clonotypes pairing with diverse TCRβ clonotypes that associated with mild disease at primary infection. These clonotypes are found at higher frequencies in pre-pandemic repertoires compared to other epitope-specific clonotypes. Longitudinal transcriptomics and TCR analysis, combined with functional evaluation, reveals that the clonotypes persisting 3–4 years post initial infection exhibit distinct functionality compared to those that were lost. Furthermore, spike-specific CD4+ T cells at this time point show decreased Th1 signatures and enhanced GZMA-driven cytotoxic transcriptomic profiles that were independent of TCR clonotype and associated with viral suppression. In summary, we identify common public TCRs used by immunodominant spike-specific memory CD4+ T-cells, associated with mild disease outcome, which likely play important protective roles to subsequent viral infection events.">

        <tr id="African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an important transboundary animal pathogen with significant impacts on the global swine industry. Overwhelming proinflammatory responses are a major virulence mechanism for ASFV, but the dynamics of these changes during clinical disease are not completely understood. We constructed a detailed portrait of the innate immune responses during acute African swine fever (ASF) at the cellular, transcriptomic, and cytokine levels. Samples serially obtained from infected piglets show progression of acute ASF is characterized by rapid increases in plasma type I interferons, TNF-α, IL-12p40, and IL-10, which coincide with the manifestation of clinical disease and viral DNAemia. Lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells progressively declined, with fluctuations in B cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell populations. Blood monocytes and macrophages were highly variable throughout infection, with an abrupt spike in CD203+ mature macrophages immediately prior to death. Transcriptomic analysis of blood showed downregulation of cellular translation as early as 1 day post challenge (DPC), and significant upregulation of antiviral immune processes at 5 DPC and 7 DPC which overlapped with the onset of clinical disease. Together, these results present a highly detailed delineation of fatal ASF as involving an initial infection and damage of susceptible myeloid cells prior to symptomatic disease characterized by pro-inflammatory immune responses, lymphoid depletion, and clinical deterioration.">

        <tr id="Crohn’s disease pathology is modeled in TNFΔARE+/− mice that overproduce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to drive disease through TNF receptors. An alternative ligand for TNF receptors, soluble LTα3, is produced by B cells, but has received scarce attention because LTα also partners with LTβ to generate membrane-tethered LTαβ2 that promotes tertiary lymphoid tissue—another feature of Crohn’s disease. We hypothesized that B cell-derived LTαβ2 would critically affect ileitis in TNFΔARE+/− mice. However, whereas deleting LTβ in B cells was essential for tertiary lymphoid tissue, disease pathology was minimally affected. By contrast, loss of B cell-derived LTα increased intestinal permeability, shrunk the pool of IgA+ ileal plasma cells, elevated cytokines and prompted weight loss, including loss of muscle mass—a systemic feature of Crohn’s disease. Neutralizing antibodies to LTα3 strongly augmented the cachexic-like effects of TNF. Thus, B cell-produced LTαβ2 and LTα3 have distinct roles in ileitis, with the role of LTα3 unexpectedly protective through counterbalancing TNF.">

        <tr id="Intoduction T lymphocytes, along with cytokines and chemokines-dependent pathways are primarily responsible for regulating the immune response, controlling inflammation and eliminating viral infections. However, excessive immune activity can lead to pathological effects such as cytokine storm, which may cause severe respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ damage in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection that could predict the severity of COVID-19 progression. Methods The cohort in this study included 52 hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from Warsaw, Poland admitted to the hospital during COVID-19 pandemic (February to November 2021). Based on clinical symptoms, patients were divided into two groups: (i) mild/moderate symptoms (non-severe) – 44 patients and (ii) severe respiratory failure (severe) – 8 patients. The control group consisted of 26 individuals without COVID-19. All COVID-19 patients and healthy controls underwent immunophenotyping of peripheral blood to assess the abundance of T lymphocytes and regulatory T lymphocytes, as well as measurement of selected cytokine and chemokine concentrations in corresponding serum samples. Data analysis was performed using CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer. Results and discussion Decreased percentages of total lymphocytes and T lymphocytes in peripheral blood were observed across all COVID-19 patients, with varying degrees between the non-severe and severe groups. A significant reduction was also noted in double-positive lymphocytes (CD4+CD8+), regulatory T lymphocytes ( CD4+ CD25HiCD127Lo and CD4+CD25HiCD127LoFoxP3+), as well as CD4+CD25+/-, CD4+CD45RA+/-, and CD8+CD45RA+/- subsets. Elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-g, CCL2, CXCL8, and CXCL10 were observed in the non-severe and/or severe groups compared to healthy controls. Most importantly, only CXCL10 was significantly elevated in the severe group at admission compared to the non-severe group. In this study, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 as a crucial marker for distinguishing the severe course of COVID-19 from non-severe form at the time of admission. It may serve as an early indicator of diseases progression during hospitalization, potentially allowing prediction of the disease course. Moreover, elevated CXCL10 levels, in combination with decreased total lymphocytes counts and increased levels of IL-6, IL10, IFNg, CCL2 and CXCL9, may represent a more comprehensive biomarker panel suitable for predicting the severity of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="RhoA, a small GTPase, plays a pivotal role in various diseases, including spinal cord injury (SCI). Although RhoA inhibition has been traditionally viewed as beneficial for SCI repair, recent clinical trials of RhoA inhibitors in SCI have failed to show significant therapeutic efficacy, suggesting functional heterogeneity across different cell types. The role of RhoA in microglia, the key immune cells involve in SCI, remains poorly understood. Using microglial RhoA conditional knockout mice, this study demonstrated that RhoA deficiency in microglia attenuates the morphological and functional repair of the SCI mice, and impairs the microglial biofunctions of proliferation, phagocytosis, and migration. Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and metabolomics revealed that RhoA deficiency can attenuate the microglial glycolytic enzyme expression, ATP production, ECAR and OCR levels through the Arhgap25/HIF-1α pathway. Overall, this is the first study to demonstrate that microglial RhoA is essential for SCI repair, the Arhgap25/HIF-1α pathway mediated glucose metabolism might enlighten a novel insight to enrich the understanding on the complex roles of RhoA and microglia in SCI repair. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of considering cell-specific roles of RhoA in SCI repair and provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies aimed at microglial metabolic reprogramming.

        <tr id="A Cytokine storm is critical in severe dengue, significantly contributing to disrupted endothelial integrity, plasma leakage, and haemorrhage manifestations in affected patients. Various reports have demonstrated that mononuclear phagocytes, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, are target cells of DENV infection. They contribute to viral spread into tissues and promote robust inflammatory responses and immunopathology. However, it remains unclear whether the early events of DENV infection play a role in triggering cytokine storms in infected mononuclear phagocytes. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profile of in vitro DENV-2-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) based on the kinetics of viral replication through a standard growth curve. To verify the accuracy of our approach, we used RT-qPCR, ELISA, and transcriptomic data from in vitro DENV-2-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and monocytes obtained from acute dengue patients. RNA-Seq analysis revealed dynamic changes in the transcriptional profile of DENV-2-infected MDMs throughout the viral growth curve. Two waves of differentially expressed genes were observed: the first occurred during the eclipse period of viral replication (3 to 5.5 h.p.i) and was associated with the induction of NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory factors, while the second wave at 24 h.p.i coincided with peaks of DENV-2 replication and induction of both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, DENV-2 infection promoted the dynamic activation of Toll-like receptors, RIG-like receptors, inflammasomes, and inflammatory pathways, triggering innate pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses. A robust multi-type IFN-dependent antiviral response was also observed at the late stage of infection. A similar transcriptomic profile was found in DENV-2-infected MDDCs and monocyte subsets from acute dengue patients, further confirming the reliability of our in vitro model of DENV-infected MDMs. Together, results suggest that recognizing viral PAMPs during the eclipse period of DENV-2 infection promotes a robust NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in MDMs. In addition, at later stages of infection, recognizing structural DENV-PAMPs and/or viral replication intermediates induces both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses, leading to a cytokine storm. These findings highlight the critical role of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in detecting DENV infection and triggering a cytokine storm in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that these cell populations could be potential targets for future immunotherapies to modulate the inflammatory response to DENV infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT RNA viruses have high mutation frequency, quick generation periods and vast population numbers, which promote fast evolution and host environment adaptation. We integrated scRNA‐seq and spatial transcriptomics to profile immune cells and viral gene expression in COVID‐19. Cell types and interactions were identified using Seurat‐based tools. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed viral hotspots, and GISAID data were used to track SARS‐CoV‐2 mutations. Single‐cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses revealed that immune cells such as Neutrophils, Monocyte:CD14 + , and T cell:CD4+ central memory are highly abundant in COVID‐19 patients, particularly in mild and severe cases, and are concentrated in the central and upper regions of lung tissue. Pseudotime and CellChat analyses indicated that cell differentiation trajectories and communication networks shift toward heightened inflammatory responses in severe conditions. Spatial analysis of viral gene expression showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 genes, especially Nucleoprotein, Spike and Envelope were highly expressed in central and upper‐right tissue regions, suggesting active viral replication. This localized viral activity was strongly associated with areas of immune cell infiltration and inflammation. The top 10 sustainable mutants in SARS‐CoV‐2 genome with high frequency were observed in NSP12 (P323L, 99%, Switzerland), Spike (D614G, 97%, Switzerland), NSP4 (T492I, 79%, Switzerland), NSP6 (T77A, 70%, Guangdong), Orf9c (G50N, 64%, England), Nucleoprotein (D377Y, 62%, United States), Orf9b (T60A, 61%, France), NSP14 (I42V, 55%, United States), Envelope (T9I, 51.3%, Trinidad and Tobago), and NSP5 (P132H, 51.2%, United States).

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with cytotoxic activity against tumors and viruses. The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased the investigation of their role in disease severity. However, their functional status and modulators remain controversial.

This study compares metabolic (SIRT1, AMPKA, HIF1A, and GLUT1) and inflammatory (NFKB1, NFKB1A, IFNG, and SOCS1) gene expression, and flow cytometry-based assessment of functional markers in NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients (n=15) and the control group (n=10), and their association with clinical outcomes. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated IFNγ, Granzyme B, and KIR2DL1 expression in NK cells compared to controls (P < 0.005), while LAMP1 was unchanged (P > 0.05). NK cells from deceased patients exhibited significantly lower expression levels of LAMP1 and Granzyme B (P < 0.05). Patients hospitalized >7 days presented lower Granzyme-B+ NK cells (P < 0.05). NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients showed downregulation of HIF1A and GLUT1, and upregulation of NFKB1 (P < 0.05). HIF1A and GLUT1 expression were elevated in patients with >7 days of hospitalization (P < 0.05). SIRT1 expression was higher in patients requiring intubation (P < 0.05). SIRT1, HIF1A, and GLUT1 were upregulated in deceased patients (P < 0.05).

        <tr id="Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant became the dominant driver during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high transmissibility and immune escape potential. Although clinical outcomes are generally mild to moderate, the inflammatory mechanisms triggered by Omicron subvariants remain poorly defined. The goal of this study was to consider both viral evolution and the host immune response by assessing plasma cytokine levels in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Methods: A total of 115 individuals were recruited, including 40 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR. Demographic, clinical, and comorbidity data were collected. Plasma levels of IL-6, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17A were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array. Subvariant data were obtained from GISAID records and grouped into early (BA.1-lineage) and late (BA.4/BA.5-lineage) Omicron clusters. Statistical analysis included non-parametric and parametric tests, correlation matrices, and multivariate comparisons. Results: Pharyngitis, nasal discharge, cough, and headache were the most common symptoms among infected individuals. Despite no significant variation in symptom distribution across subvariants, infected patients showed higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-2 compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected controls (p < 0.05). IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in early Omicron infections. No associations were observed between cytokine levels and comorbidities. A significant correlation was found between reporting fewer symptoms and having received three vaccine doses. Conclusions: Infection with Omicron subvariants elicits a strong yet balanced cytokine response. Despite genetic divergence between lineages, immune and clinical patterns remain conserved, with vaccination appearing to mitigate the symptom burden.">

Recently, North American elk have been identified as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a potential threat to humans and other mammals. In this work, we characterized the peripheral transcriptomic response to experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in calves and adult elk at different time points. Results Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified at 2-, 5-, and 14-days post inoculation (pi) for both age groups. Adult elk presented the greatest number of differentially expressed (DE) genes at all time points, including many genes associated with viral response, immune activation, antibody production, as well as genes associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and coronavirus GO terms and KEGG pathways. Calves presented DE genes associated with viral responses at 5 days pi as well as neurodegenerative-associated genes at 14 days pi. Both adults and calves showed predicted activation of the ISGF3 and IFN type I pathways at day 2 pi and, globally, increased activity related to the coronavirus pathway disease at 5 and 14 days pi. Conclusions Collectively, this work provides valuable data characterizing the cervid immune response of elk to viral diseases as well as the response of wildlife to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2), a gene linked to familial and sporadic PD, has been positively associated with neuroinflammation in both in vitro and in vivo systems. These observations suggest that LRRK2 might actively contribute to neuronal damage and degeneration in NDs. Based on these premises, we explored the impact of LRRK2-mediated neuroinflammation on neurons in a PD- and AD-related context. We set up a cellular model composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons (dopaminergic for PD and cholinergic for AD) exposed to inflamed glial medium [α-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (α-syn pffs) for PD and amyloid-β (Aβ)1–42 fibrils for AD] for several days. To dissect the effect of neuroinflammation, and specifically, the role of LRRK2, on neuronal functions, we first performed transcriptome analysis, and then, we validated the results at functional levels. Interestingly, we found that LRRK2-dependent neuroinflammation contributes to neuronal dysfunctions and death in both ND contexts and that LRRK2 kinase inhibition prevents these detrimental effects. Overall, our results suggest that lowering neuroinflammation through LRRK2 pharmacological inhibition might limit the progression of NDs and thus be neuroprotective.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestation has been linked to adverse obstetrical outcomes and placental abnormalities. Nevertheless, the susceptibility of early trophoblast cells to SARS-CoV-2 and the potential consequences of infection on trophoblast function remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the permissiveness of first trimester trophoblast cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its impact on trophoblast cells fusion. To address this, we isolated primary cytotrophoblast (CTB) cells from first trimester human placentas and allow their differentiation into STB in vitro. These cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Delta and Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.5). Viral replication was assessed by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence, while host cell responses, including expression of viral entry receptors and innate immunity genes, were measured by RT-qPCR. Trophoblast fusion was evaluated by staining and calculating the fusion index. In parallel, placental tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnancies were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to quantify syncytial knots (SK) formation in vivo. Our results demonstrate that both first trimester CTB and STB are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a variant- and donor-dependent manners, with Delta exhibiting higher replication efficiency compared to Omicron variants. In STB, viral replication did not correlate with the induction of entry receptors or type III interferon responses. However, in CTB, viral replication was significantly associated with enhanced cell fusion. In parallel, an increased number of SK was observed in infected placental areas in vivo compared to non-infected regions from the same placenta and to gestational age-matched controls. Altogether, these in vitro and in vivo results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy may alter STB turnover, potentially contributing to placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection lead to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in COVID-19 and Long COVID are unclear. Cerebrovascular Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity is suppressed in association with neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in a mouse model of COVID-19. In this study, we asked whether SARS-CoV-2 (NY Iota strain) infection of astrocytes would result in cell-autonomous changes in Wnt/β-catenin pathway components. We report that induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived human astrocytes (iAs) are susceptible to sustained infection with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Real-time PCR revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of iAs decreased transcripts for Wnt3a, Wnt10b, and the downstream pathway effectors β-catenin and TCF3. Wnt7b was increased, as was the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10. No changes were noted in Wnt3, Wnt7a, TCF1, TCF4, or LEF1. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection differentially influences Wnt/β-catenin pathway components in astrocytes. These data could have implications for the mechanistic basis of COVID-19 and Long COVID.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a rising concern in global health in recent years. The role of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint in acute ZIKV infection remains to be understood. In this study we demonstrated the activation of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint by ZIKV. mRNA and protein expression of PD-L1 was boosted by ZIKV not only in SF268 and JEG3 cell lines but also in human dendritic cells. PD-1 expression was more abundant on CD8+ T cells in ZIKV-infected mice. Elevated PD-L1 expression was also observed in the brain, testis and spleen of ZIKV-infected A129 mice. Blocking PD-L1 effectively inhibited ZIKV infection, reducing viral loads in all tissues. In addition, anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment further increased virus-specific CD8+ T cells, KLRG+ CD8+ T cells, and effector memory CD8+ T cells. PD-L1 blockade also induced interferon γ, granzyme B, and interleukin 2 expression in antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, consistent with activation of these cells. Mechanistically, the induction of PD-L1 expression might be ascribed to viral NS4B protein and its interaction with GRP78. Our findings suggest that targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could have antiviral effect against ZIKV.">

Although single-cell transcriptomic approaches have illuminated the trajectories of AD progression in both animal models and human brains, they often lack the spatial context necessary to fully comprehend cell–cell interactions and microenvironmental influences. In this review, we discuss recent advances in spatial transcriptomics—integrating both imaging- and sequencing-based methods—that map gene expression within intact brain tissues. We highlight how these technologies have revealed regional heterogeneity and functional diversity among microglia, and their dynamic interactions with astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes in both aging and AD. Emphasis is placed on the interactions of microglia within the amyloid plaque niche, their contribution to synaptic degeneration, and how aging accelerates microglial and glial activation. By synthesizing findings from AD mouse models and physiologically characterized human tissues, we provide a comprehensive view of the cellular interplay driving AD pathogenesis and offer insights into potential therapeutic avenues.">

This study investigated host autoreactivities in SARS-CoV-2 infections, their association with severe COVID-19, and the neutralizing antibody response. Circulating autoantibodies were detected in convalescent serum samples from unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Clustering, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and neural network modeling were used to explore the relationship between autoantibodies, hospitalization, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The presence of one autoantibody correlated with the detection of multiple others. Anti-IFNα antibodies were associated with elevated levels of anti-ENAs (extractable-nuclear antigen) but not with clinical outcome. COVID-19 hospitalization was significantly associated with the collective expression of autoantibodies targeting three ENAs: SSA/Ro52, Jo-1, and RNP. In contrast, autoantibodies targeting RNP/Sm, PCNA, Scl-70, and PL-12 were strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. In summary, this study has identified self-antigens targeted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and highlights a novel association between the autoantibody response and the antiviral humoral response.">

        <tr id="Medical interventions, such as masks, were a cornerstone in mitigating the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since 2019, the scientific community has increasingly focused on exploring avenues for pandemic prevention and preparedness to enhance responses to future viral outbreaks. One such area of interest explores the use of additives, such as silicon nitride (Si₃N₄), in masks to enhance the antiviral properties of personal protective equipment. Si₃N₄ powder has been shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 under aqueous conditions, with a similar yet modest reduction in virus when embedded into non-woven fabric. This study aimed to optimize the use of Si₃N₄ as an antiviral agent. We addressed this knowledge gap by comparing the viral inactivation potential of β-Si₃N₄ and α-Si₃N₄ powders against multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Additionally, we tested a refined non-woven fabric embedded with α-Si₃N₄ against SARS-CoV-2 (Lineage A). The results presented here suggest that α-Si₃N₄ was the most effective in reducing the infectious virus through viral RNA degradation, as determined by plaque assay and RT-qPCR. The most promising finding was the significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 after only 10 min of exposure to refined α-Si₃N₄-embedded fabric. Thus, silicon nitride could be an invaluable inorganic additive in personal protective equipment during future viral epidemics and pandemics.">

With no approved treatments, the long-term global health and economic impact of chronic LC remains high and growing. LC affects children, adolescents, and healthy adults and is characterized by over 200 diverse symptoms that persist for months to years after the acute COVID-19 infection is resolved. These symptoms target twelve major organ systems, causing dyspnea, vascular damage, cognitive impairments (“brain fog”), physical and mental fatigue, anxiety, and depression. This heterogeneity of LC symptoms, along with the lack of specific biomarkers and diagnostic tests, presents a significant challenge to the development of LC treatments. While several biological abnormalities have emerged as potential drivers of LC, a causative factor in a large subset of patients with LC, involves reservoirs of virus and/or viral RNA (vRNA) that persist months to years in multiple organs driving chronic inflammation, respiratory, muscular, cognitive, and cardiovascular damages, and provide continuous viral antigenic stimuli that overstimulate and exhaust CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In this review, we (i) shed light on persisting virus and vRNA reservoirs detected, either directly (from biopsy, blood, stool, and autopsy samples) or indirectly through virus-specific B and T cell responses, in patients with LC and their association with the chronic symptomatology of LC; (ii) explore potential mechanisms of inflammation, immune evasion, and immune overstimulation in LC; (iii) review animal models of virus reservoirs in LC; (iv) discuss potential T cell immunotherapeutic strategies to reduce or eliminate persistent virus reservoirs, which would mitigate chronic inflammation and alleviate symptom severity in patients with LC.">

        <tr id="Chikungunya fever (CF), caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), is characterized by disabling symptoms such as joint pain that can last for months. Monocytes play a central role in immune modulation and viral replication during infection. This study evaluated the clinical and immunological profiles of patients with laboratory-confirmed CF. Fever and joint pain were the most frequently reported symptoms, whereas edema was more common in women. CHIKV-infect individuals exhibited increased TLR4 expression in non-classical monocytes (CD14+CD16++). Additionally, intermediate (CD14+CD16+) and non-classical (CD14+CD16++) monocytes expressing TLR7 were enriched during the acute phase and in some chronic patients, thereby suggest prolonged TLR7 pathway activation. Levels of soluble CD163 (sCD163)—a marker of monocyte/macrophage activation—were elevated as well, indicating sustained immune activation. Coagulation-related mediators—including Tissue factor (TF) and Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)—also increased, despite the rarity of hemorrhagic events or thrombocytopenia. Patients with arthritis demonstrated higher frequencies of TLR7+ intermediate monocytes and elevated Epidermal growth factor (EGF) levels, whereas those with edema exhibit increased Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Overall, these findings highlighted the differential activation of CD16+ monocytes and suggested that sCD163 is a marker of monocyte/macrophage activation during CHIKV infection.">

        <tr id="Background: PDLIM2, a PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein expressed highest in the lung and immune cells, serves as a unique tumor suppressor and immune modulator, mainly by turning off the activation of the master transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3. While its role in cancer is established, the involvement of PDLIM2 in viral infection remains unclear. Results: Here, we analyzed public gene expression data of blood leukocytes, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and lung tissues from uninfected healthy humans and those infected with the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We found that PDLIM2 expression was repressed by viral infection, and notably, this repression correlated with the severity of infectious diseases. Consistently, the expression level of PDLIM2 was negatively associated with NF-κB and STAT3 activity across a diverse range of cell types, such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, alveolar type 1 and 2 epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. Accordingly, cells with low PDLIM2 expression exhibited aberrant activation of signaling pathways essential for cellular functions and immune responses.

        <tr id="Mucosal immunity is an important correlate of protection against respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2. Comparing B cell responses in the upper respiratory tract following vaccination and infection may offer unique insights into mucosal immunity. Here, we characterized antigen-specific B cells in the tonsils, adenoids, and peripheral blood of children who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. SARS-CoV-2-specific switched memory B cells (BSM) and germinal center B cells were found in the blood and pharyngeal lymphoid tissues after vaccination or infection. However, infection generated a higher proportion of IgA+ BSM and CXCR3+CD21+ BSM, which showed distinct spatial localization, greater clonal expansion and increased propensity for plasma cell differentiation compared to their CXCR3− counterparts, accompanied by persistent activation of innate and T follicular helper cells in the tissues. Our data provide evidence for tissue-specific B cell memory after either SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection, but with distinct characteristics that can influence the quality, durability, and localization of immunity.">

        <tr id="Background Neuroinflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of several central nervous system disorders. Excessive and prolonged neuroinflammation impacts disease progression and potential interventions. A widely used model of peripherally-induced neuroinflammation involves the intraperitoneal administration of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mice. In this exploratory study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to non-invasively investigate in the brain acute neuroinflammation induced by peripheral LPS stimulation and in combination with the microglia depleting effects of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor kinase inhibitor BLZ945. Methods Multiparametric MRI, including T2-weighted signal, magnetization transfer ratio MTR, and apparent diffusion coefficient ADC, was applied to analyze the model. LPS was administered intraperitoneally once daily from day 1 to day 4 at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Post-mortem analyses comprised cytokine/chemokine measurements in the blood and brain, immunohistochemistry of microglia and astrocytes, and brain autoradiography using the TSPO radiotracer [3H]PK11195. BLZ945 (200 mg/kg p.o. daily) was given from day − 7 to day 4. Results On day 4 of LPS administration, T2-weighted signal and MTR increased, while ADC decreased in several brain regions. Neuroinflammation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, which revealed an increase of microglia and astrocytes in the cortex. Additionally, autoradiography showed increased uptake of [3H]PK11195 in the cortex and thalamus/midbrain of animals receiving LPS. Treatment with BLZ945 resulted in a reduction of the LPS-elicited response, as revealed in vivo by MRI and confirmed by post-mortem histology and autoradiography analysis. Conclusion The present findings highlight the potential of non-contrast-enhanced MRI to assess acute neuroinflammation-related changes in several mouse brain areas upon peripheral LPS stimulation. The assessment of multiple parameters provided sufficient sensitivity to detect pharmacological modulation of the neuroinflammatory response elicited by the endotoxin.

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from all cells of the body. They are considered to mirror the state of the cells from which they are released and circulate in the blood, suggesting a possible use of EV analysis for diagnostic purposes. Here, we report that the analysis of single EVs by flow cytometry can detect infection of cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by identifying expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein on the surface of EVs and the cellular origin of EVs by detecting cell-type-specific markers such as troponin (cTNT1) for cardiomyocytes. In coronavirus-associated disease 19 (COVID-19) patients, we detected a direct correlation of the frequencies of circulating S-expressing EVs, but not of cTNT/S-co-expressing EVs, with the subsequent development of a severe disease course. Detection of circulating S-expressing EVs indicates widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection in the body, which may contribute to the immune pathogenesis that triggers tissue and organ damage in COVID-19. Our findings suggest that detecting circulating viral antigen-expressing EVs may provide crucial predictive information on infection-associated disease courses in situations of a future viral pandemic.IMPORTANCEThe ability to predict which patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus will develop severe disease remains a significant clinical challenge. The present study demonstrates that EVs in the peripheral blood, carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, can be detected by flow cytometry and serve as early biomarkers of disease progression. In contradistinction to PCR or serology, this method provides insight into systemic viral spread and potential organ involvement. The early identification of spike-positive EVs at the time of hospital admission has the potential to facilitate the timely identification of high-risk patients, thereby enhancing the efficacy of triage and subsequent care. This approach may also be of value in terms of facilitating a more rapid and precise response to future virus pandemics.">

        <tr id="Understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cancer patients remains a critical priority given their immunocompromised status. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated humoral and cellular immunity across three time points—baseline, post-second dose, and post-booster—in 23 breast cancer patients undergoing active treatment. IgG antibody levels showed a significant increase following vaccination, with a 300-fold rise after the second dose and a 2200-fold increase post-booster, indicating a strong humoral response. CD19+ B cells also increased significantly, supporting B cell-mediated activation. Although overall T cell frequencies remained stable, we observed a shift toward memory phenotypes, with decreased naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased central and peripheral memory subsets after the booster. Notably, CD8+ TEMRA cells expanded significantly, suggesting cytotoxic memory formation. Correlation analyses linked peripheral memory CD4+ T cells with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, while CD8+ TEMRA cells showed an inverse association. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response was evaluated using APC-labeled MHC I Dextramer reagents. After the booster, 55.5% of patients developed detectable antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, whereas 44.5% did not. Importantly, one patient who failed to develop antigen-specific CD8+ T cells experienced a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the absence of this response may increase susceptibility despite high IgG levels. These findings indicate that antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and antibody levels may act as complementary but not directly correlated arms of immunity. Microbiota profiling via sPLS-DA suggested weak but distinct microbial signatures associated with immune responsiveness, particularly enrichment of taxa such as Alistipes and Romoutsia among high-antibody responders. These findings emphasize that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is immunogenic and well tolerated in breast cancer patients under therapy and highlight the need to further explore microbiota–immune interactions to optimize vaccination strategies in oncology.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 7 million deaths, but its legacy extends beyond mortality. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces immune alterations that persist post-recovery, manifesting not only in long COVID (LC) but also in healthy individuals. Cytokines serve as critical orchestrators of these processes. The goal of this study is to investigate post-pandemic immune remodeling through cytokine assessment in both patients with LC and healthy donor, and to compare the post-pandemic population with pre-pandemic controls to find changes in the immune responses and cytokine profiles. A panel of 47 immune mediators (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) was measured with the MAGPIX multiplex analysis. LC was characterized by an increase in IL-7, IL-8, IL-17F, IL-18, EGF, FGF-2, PDGF-AA, sCD40L, and MCP-3 and a decrease in IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, IL-27, and FLT-3L. Comparing post-pandemic recovered individuals with pre-pandemic healthy cohort, we saw an upregulation of IL-13 and MCP-3 and a downregulation of MDC, M-CSF, IL-12, and IL-17F. While LC is characterized by persistent immune imbalance—particularly in cytokine networks—our data emphasize the critical need to study healthy donors in both pre- and post-pandemic eras when analyzing and interpreting these changes.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive decline in dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra (SN). Although its underlying cause has yet to be fully elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that neuroinflammation contributes substantially to disease development. Treatment strategies targeting neuroinflammation could improve PD outcomes. Monocyte-derived tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) modulate immune responses and induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) during various inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying tolDC-mediated immunoregulation in PD remain unclear.


METHODS
We investigated the immune modulatory role of tolDCs by analyzing gene expression patterns and identified that the C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (Clec5a) was highly induced in tolDCs. To assess its function, we generated Clec5a-knockdown tolDCs and measured cytokine production, including interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6, forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3)+ Treg induction, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling activity. Furthermore, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of Clec5a-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Dopaminergic neuron survival, α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation, neuroinflammatory markers, and locomotor behavior were analyzed following DC administration.


RESULTS
Clec5a-knockdown tolDCs exhibited reduced immunomodulatory function and IL-10 levels but enhanced IL-6 levels. In addition, these cells induced fewer Foxp3+ Tregs and showed significantly enhanced NF-κB signaling activity. In the MPTP-induced PD model, administration of Clec5a-expressing DCs ameliorated dopaminergic neuron loss and α-syn accumulation. Furthermore, Clec5a-expressing DCs reduced the number of CD45highCD11b+CD86+ macrophages in the brain, reduced brain inflammatory cytokine expression, and improved locomotor activity.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that Clec5a plays a critical role in the immunomodulatory function of tolDCs. The administration of Clec5a-expressing DCs effectively reduced neuroinflammation and protected dopaminergic neurons in an MPTP-induced PD model. Therefore, Clec5a-expressing tolDCs may demonstrate therapeutic potential by managing PD symptoms by suppressing inflammatory responses associated with neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a profound global impact, yet children exhibited distinct clinical and epidemiological patterns compared to adults. Pediatric cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were generally characterized by milder disease, lower hospitalization rates, and few long-term sequelae. However, a subset of children developed severe complications such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), highlighting the heterogeneity in disease presentation. Differences in immune system maturity and comorbidities likely contribute to the age-dependent manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, has been implicated in the emergence of new viral variants with immune escape characteristics due to ongoing viral replication in the presence of selective pressure. While SARS-CoV-2 evolution in persistently infected adults has been well-documented, it is less clear how the virus evolves during persistent infection in the pediatric population. To address this question, we performed viral whole genome sequencing of longitudinal specimens collected from immunocompetent and immunocompromised pediatric COVID-19 patients. Similarly to what has been observed in adult cohorts, mutations associated with enhanced viral fitness and immune escape arose intra-host over time. Intra-host diversity accumulated at similar rates in immunocompetent and immunocompromised children, though more mutations overall were observed in the immunocompromised cohort due to the longer infection time courses. Overall, we identified similar viral evolutionary trends over the course of infection despite clinical differences in pediatric COVID-19 manifestation and severity. This similarity suggests that persistent infection in children may be an additional, but not unique, source of ongoing viral diversification.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal meningitis is a fungal infection in patients with compromised CD4 T cell function. CD4 T cells provide killing signals to macrophages, principally IFNγ, to limit intracellular fungal replication. However, CD4 T cells may also drive inflammatory tissue damage. Yet, it is not fully understood how fungal-specific CD4 T cells infiltrate the brain and how they influence functional phenotypes of CNS-resident myeloid cells. In the current work, we develop a mouse model to track fungal-specific CD4 T cells and determine their influence on microglia. We found IFNγ+ fungal-specific CD4 T cells have limited TCR signalling and characterise a population of inflammatory microglia that upregulate MHCII and IFNγ-regulated genes during infection. Inflammatory microglia have poor fungicidal capacity and significantly expand during infection, a process that depends on CD4 T cell infiltration. Taken together, these data identify the early inflammatory consequences of fungal-specific CD4 T cell infiltration and identify proliferating microglia as important drivers of brain inflammation during infection.">

Canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy dogs and stimulated with three different antigens of A vasorum, including adult excretory-secretory products (ESP), adult full-worm somatic antigen, and first-stage larval (L1) somatic antigen. Temporal dynamics and magnitude of relative cytokine expression (IFNγ, TNF, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13) was evaluated after 4 h, 24 h, and 5 days of antigen exposure via quantitative reverse transcription PCR. To determine whether the cytokine expression changes translated into shifts in circulating mononuclear cell subsets or proliferative activity, phenotypic characterisation by flow cytometry was conducted after a 72 h stimulation with L1 antigen or ESP, and compared to unstimulated controls. Results Early responses varied across antigen types, with ESP promoting a regulatory cytokine profile with modest upregulation of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, and downregulation of IFNγ, TNF, and IL-13. Adult antigen induced increased expression of all examined cytokines, while L1 antigen triggered the strongest inflammatory response compared to the other antigens. At 24 h, all responses were amplified, particularly those to L1 and adult antigen, and showed a shift towards a Th2 cytokine profile with increased IL-4 and IL-13 expression. By five days, IL-4 and IL-13 remained predominant. No change in the relative abundance of major immune cell populations (CD4⁺ T cells, CD8⁺ T cells, B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and CD14⁻ CD22⁻ antigen-presenting cells) was observed in flow cytometry following stimulation. However, a notable increase in Ki67 expression, a marker of cell proliferation, was detected in CD8⁺ T cells after L1 antigen stimulation. Conclusions Distinct cytokine profiles elicited by different A. vasorum antigens suggest that the parasite’s modulation of host immunity and induction of stage-specific responses are key to persistence and clinical presentation of canine angiostrongylosis. Further investigation into the antigenic components and immune pathways may lead to tailored therapies, improved clinical management, and to a deeper understanding of stage-specific aspects of helminth infections.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has converged with the HIV epidemic. Although immunocompromised patients show an elevated risk of death due to COVID-19 compared to HIV infection, the impact remains contradictory. One reason could be the use of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Patients with HIV receiving ARV, such as tenofovir (TDF), have fewer symptoms of COVID-19. In mice, bleomycin (BLM) induces acute lung injury, resulting in an acute inflammatory response similar to the cytokine storm and lung damage observed in COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the preventive role of TDF administration prior to BLM administration. A total of 64 eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, France), both male and female, were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n = 8 per sex per group): (i) oral TDF administered in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by oropharyngeal aspiration (OA) of saline on day 7 (TDF); (ii) oral TDF in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (TDF-BLM); (iii) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of saline on day 7 (SAL); and (iv) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (BLM). Animals were euthanized 72 h after OA (day 10), and serum and lung tissues were collected for analysis. TDF-BLM lungs showed significantly reduced bronchioalveolar lavage fluid total cell counts, specifically reduced macrophages and neutrophils counts, but an increased presence of minority lymphocytes. TDF downregulated BLM-induced levels of Il1β, Il6, TNFα, and Tgfβ mRNA. Preventive treatment with TDF counteracted BLM-induced alveolar and bronchiolar cell damage. Male mice showed more severe symptoms after BLM administration for most parameters, and the preventive action of TDF was similar in both sexes. Preventive TDF administration partially counteracted BLM-induced acute lung injury. These findings support epidemiological observations suggesting a potential benefit of TDF as a prophylactic therapy against COVID-19, at least in HIV-infected patients.">

Subsequently, the graft is re-infected early in the post-procedural phase, leading to viral persistence for more than five months. By analyzing viral evolution and effector immune response within the transplanted organ, we observe three main findings. First, virus evolution differs in the transplanted organ compared to that in the upper respiratory tract and is affected by monoclonal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and molnupiravir. Second, we show the potential clinical relevance of T cell HLA restriction that may facilitate viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract compared to the ongoing viral replication in the HLA mismatch organ. Third, close monitoring and modulation of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy enables viral clearance in a lung transplantation setting despite incomplete SARS-CoV-2 clearance prior to transplantation.">

        <tr id="As the pediatric COVID-19 landscape evolves, it is essential to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes children to allergic disorders. This narrative review synthesizes current epidemiological and immunological evidence linking pediatric COVID-19 with new-onset atopy. Epidemiological data remain heterogeneous: large Korean and multinational cohorts report increased risks of asthma and allergic rhinitis following COVID-19, whereas U.S. cohorts show neutral or protective associations, highlighting geographic and methodological variability. Mechanistic insights provide biological plausibility: epithelial injury and the release of alarmin cytokines (IL-33, IL-25, TSLP) promote Th2 polarization and ILC2 expansion, while epigenetic “scars” (e.g., LMAN2 methylation changes) and hematopoietic stem cell reprogramming may sustain long-term Th2 bias. Cytokine memory involving IL-7 and IL-15 contributes to altered T- and B-cell homeostasis, whereas disrupted regulatory T-cell function may reduce tolerance thresholds. Paradoxical trade-offs exist, such as ACE2 downregulation in allergic airways, which may lower viral entry but simultaneously amplify type-2 inflammation. Together, these processes suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection could foster a pro-allergic milieu in susceptible children. Although current evidence is inconclusive, integrating epidemiological surveillance with mechanistic studies is crucial for predicting and alleviating post-COVID allergic outcomes. Longitudinal pediatric cohorts and interventions targeting epithelial alarmins or microbiome restoration may hold promise for prevention.">

        <tr id="Environmental toxicants such as maneb (MB), a dithiocarbamate pesticide, trigger progressive neuronal death, probably due to the imbalance in inflammation/resolution mechanisms, resulting in the onset of neurodegeneration. The inflammation/resolution balance is governed by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, but it has been poorly described in the Central Nervous System (CNS), since resolution GPCR ligands are negligible and elusive lipid compounds. These mediators are mainly synthesized by lipoxygenases (ALOX) from arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) released by specific phospholipases A2 (PLA2). Thus, we aimed to characterize the molecular components of resolution involved in neuron-astrocyte communication in response to MB-induced toxicity. The metabolomics study showed significant changes in 20 metabolites in neurons and 43 in astrocytes as a response to MB treatment. Major phospholipids’ content (phosphatidylcholine - PC - and phosphatidylethanolamine) was reduced in both cell types with a simultaneous increase in lysophospholipids. In silico analysis revealed the upregulation of a Group IID secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IID), and the fatty acid profile showed increased neuronal DHA content and decreased AA and DHA levels in astrocytes. In addition, increased DHA esterified-PC content in neurons exposed to MB was observed. Astrocyte secretome and its lipid extract protected neurons against MB-induced toxicity. This neuroprotective effect was abolished by blocking AA and DHA oxygenation by ALOX-15 and associated with the activation of the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2/ALX), probably mediated by lipoxin A4. Moreover, a neuronal lipid ligand induced astrocyte proliferation through this GPCR. Our study suggests that molecular components of the FPR2/ALX pathway participate in both the neuroprotection exerted by astrocytes and astrocytic proliferative signals shaped by neurons under MB toxicity.

        <tr id="Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted investigation into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in lung cancer patients. Understanding this interplay is crucial for optimizing cancer immunotherapy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on lung cancer patients, characterizing changes in peripheral immune cells and plasma cytokines (including IL-10 and IL-12p70) before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between ICI-treated patients with and without COVID-19. Cytokine dynamics were further analyzed in a non-infected cohort. Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a prolonged systemic cytokine storm, with elevated IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels and reduced monocyte proportions lasting up to 10 weeks post-recovery. Despite this immune perturbation, COVID-19 did not impair long-term PFS; instead, a transient improvement in disease control was observed in infected patients. In non-infected patients, sustained or increased IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels during ICI therapy were associated with longer PFS (p < 0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection transiently alters the immune landscape in lung cancer patients without compromising ICI efficacy. The sustained elevation of IL-10 and IL-12p70 may contribute to short-term clinical benefits. Monitoring cytokine dynamics could serve as a prognostic tool for predicting ICI response.">

        <tr id="Although inflammatory complications are common in preterm infants, their effects on neonatal immune development remain poorly defined. We therefore investigated whether severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and systemic infection, two major complications of prematurity, produce distinct immune signatures and change immune composition over time. We performed longitudinal high-dimensional immune profiling of residual whole blood from 38 preterm infants sampled every two weeks, along with 10 term infants at birth. Preterm infants with severe BPD showed a progressive increase in Th17-polarized CD4+ T cells, neutrophils, and Th17-related cytokines compared to age-matched infants with moderate BPD. In contrast, some preterm infants with systemic bacterial or viral infections mounted robust CD8+, CD4+, and {gamma}{delta} T cell responses, with oligoclonal expansion, terminal differentiation, and coordinated plasma cytokine shifts that persisted well beyond resolution of infection. These findings demonstrate that different preterm comorbidities imprint the neonatal immune system in divergent ways. Longitudinal immune profiling offers a powerful tool to uncover these trajectories and identify potential targets for intervention.">

        <tr id="Background The kynurenine pathway (KP) plays a major role in neuroinflammation by converting the amino acid tryptophan into a variety of neuroactive products, including neurotoxic quinolinic acid (QUIN). The gene expression regulatory role of microRNAs in neuroinflammation is well documented; however, their impact on KP in the brain remains unexplored. Methods In this study, we investigated whether the neuroimmune miR-132/212 cluster regulates one or more members of the KP during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in vivo in mice and in vitro in BV-2 microglial cells. Results In wildtype mice, we demonstrated that a subtoxic dose of LPS triggers a significant neuroinflammatory response with upregulation of KP enzymes, particularly kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), a key enzyme in QUIN synthesis, leading to elevated brain levels of this neurotoxic metabolite. Interestingly, KMO expression and activity remained elevated in miR-132/212 knockout mice after post-inflammation resolution. In vitro experiments using BV-2 microglial cells showed that miR-132 overexpression led to downregulation of KMO expression and enzyme activity and reduced QUIN levels without altering the microglial activation status. Conclusion Collectively, these findings suggest that the miR-132/212 cluster functions as a novel modulator of KP metabolism during LPS-induced inflammation, and acts as a potential therapeutic target for controlling neurotoxic QUIN accumulation in neuroinflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Immune induction under B‐cell depletion is complex and far from being fully understood. Methods We investigated clinical and immunological responses after dual homologous mRNA vaccination with BNT162b2 and after booster vaccination or infection in 14 B‐cell depleted patients with inflammatory central nervous system disease in comparison to 28 healthy controls. Spike‐specific IgG were determined using ELISA and neutralizing activity by surrogate assay. Reactive T cells were flow‐cytometrically analyzed after spike‐specific and polyclonal stimulation. Reactogenicity was self‐reported using a questionnaire. Results Vaccination was well tolerated, with slightly more systemic events reported by patients. Spike‐specific antibodies were induced in all controls, but only 43% of patients with significantly lower IgG levels and reduced neutralizing capacity (p < 0.0001). In contrast, spike‐reactive T cells were induced in both groups with similar CD4 and higher CD8 T‐cell levels in patients. Functional characterization of spike‐reactive T cells revealed equally high CTLA‐4 expression in both groups, but higher proportions of polyfunctional, triple‐cytokine expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells in patients especially after the third immunization. Three patients experienced mild breakthrough infections after second vaccination. Conclusions Despite limited ability of B‐cell depleted patients to mount a humoral immune response after multiple doses of SARS‐CoV‐2 mRNA vaccination, the vaccine‐induced T‐cell response is robust, which may have implications for protection against severe disease.">

        <tr id="Ending of COVID-19 pandemic does not exclude subsequent breakthrough infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutations increased with emerging omicron strain and exceeds those of the influenza virus. It remains unclear what IgG antibody levels are able to protect against new mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains, and how long the immune protection will last. The objective of this study was to monitor the maintenance of humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens over 4 years after the infection. Thirty-two adult reconvalescents after COVID-19 were annually examined for humoral and cellular immunity markers to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Humoral immunity was assessed by ELISA; cellular immunity was evaluated by expression of CD107a on CD8hi lymphocytes after recognition of S protein antigens. A four-year observation of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 (SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan strain) and were in contact with a novel, freely circulating mutant VoCs showed that, 1 year later, all subjects retained the IgG antibodies to S protein, mainly the IgG1 subclass, but the antibody avidity index barely exceeded 50%. After a breakthrough infection caused by the omicron strain, the level of IgG antibodies to S protein increased significantly, along with sufficient increase of antibody avidity. The IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 antibodies to S protein occured in the spectrum of subclasses. The level of specific IgA decreased 1 year after the disease against their level after the primary disease. However, it was significantly increased to 4-5 PR after breakthrough infections. Cellular immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was detected in all subjects at 1 year after the primary disease. After repeated infection with the omicron strain, it increased significantly and remained at this level for the next year. By 4 years, it decreased to the level that was a year after the disease. Hence, humoral and cellular immunity to S protein does not fade away, but continues to persist, maturate, being maintained at a sufficient level. Upon exposure to a new VoC, it allows to endure such a meeting either asymptomatically, or as a mild clinical infection. In view of frequent mutations in the S protein, the role of T-cell responses in anti-infectious protection seems to increase significantly. When developing new vaccines, one should rely on development of cellular immunity.">

Unlike relapsing MS, PMS is sustained by resident CNS immune networks, where activated microglia and astrocytes orchestrate persistent cytokine signaling—particularly involving TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6—through self-amplifying feedback loops. In this narrative review, we explore how these cytokines interact with oxidative stress, iron accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired autophagy to drive neurodegeneration. Human-based evidence is integrated with insights from experimental models to clarify translational mechanisms. We also highlight fluid biomarkers (e.g., GFAP, NfL) and imaging modalities (e.g., TSPO-PET, QSM) that reflect glial activity and disease progression in vivo. Age, sex hormones, and immunosenescence are discussed as modulators of cytokine expression. Finally, we review emerging therapeutic strategies that target glial metabolism and cytokine networks rather than peripheral immune cells, offering a systems-based framework for future PMS interventions and personalized disease monitoring.">

        <tr id="Background The immunogenicity of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has been reported as highly variable in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI). Objective The aim of this study was to study memory CD4+ T-cell-mediated responses against the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 along with CMV peptides in a large IEI group composed of mostly predominantly antibody-deficient (PAD) patients. Patients and methods In vitro antigen-specific T-cell anti-S and -CMV responses after two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were assessed in peripheral blood from 114 patients with IEI and 38 healthcare healthy controls (HCHC). Stimulation index (SI) based on the percentages of CD4+ T lymphocytes with effector memory phenotype CD45RA−CD27− (TEM) was quantified by flow cytometry. Results Patients with IEI overall, as well as the two main groups of PAD [i.e., common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and isotype or functional antibody deficiencies (IOFD)], showed frequencies of responder individuals and median SI against SARS-CoV-2 comparable to HCHC. However, those IEI and CVID subgroups positive for anti-CMV T-cell immunity showed a significantly reduced response (SI) against S-peptides when compared to their IEI and CVID counterparts who were anti-CMV TEM negative. This effect of CMV stratification is independent of age in our patient group. Conclusion CMV latency negatively impacted the CD4+ TEM population’s functionality regarding COVID-19 vaccination in patients with CVID. Our results in patients with IEI and previous similar findings in healthy populations highlight the fact that when assessing immune-specific responses, the inclusion of CMV monitoring is suitable, is worthwhile, and may potentially be extended to vaccinations against different pathogens to prevent human disease more accurately.">

It is a key factor in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, contributing to neuronal energy deficits, oxidative stress, and disruption of calcium homeostasis. Astrocytes are known to play an important role in maintaining neuronal health, including through the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. However, changes occurring within the mitochondrial network of astrocytes themselves at early stages of pathology remain poorly understood. In the present study, we analyzed intracellular mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in astrocytes modeling Alzheimer’s disease.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation and neuronal death are direct consequences of persistent microglial activation observed in many chronic neurological conditions. Activated microglia impact neuronal cells by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators, leading to neuronal damage and neurodegeneration. To investigate whether Polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA molecule, induces neuroinflammation and neuronal death, we exposed microglia (HMC-3 cells) to poly I: C for 24 hrs, and assessed inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, to investigate whether poly(I:C) induces memory impairment and motor coordination deficits in C57BL/6 mice, we conducted a behavioural assessment and measured the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Poly (I:C) exposure significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression of inflammasome, proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-18) and chemokines in microglia. Poly (I: C) also significantly increased the translocation of NF-kB from the cytosol to the nucleus. Furthermore, the conditioned medium from poly(I:C)-treated cells markedly increased apoptosis in human neuronal cells (differentiated SHSY5Y cells) by activating pro-apoptotic markers, including Bax, Bad, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and AIF. In mice, exposure to poly (I:C) significantly increased the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, in the hippocampus. It also decreased the percentage of alternation in the T-maze test and reduced the distance travelled and average speed in the open field test, indicating motor and cognitive deficits. These findings suggest that poly (I:C) induces neuroinflammation through the inflammasome and proinflammatory mediators via the NLRP3/NF-κB signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo and induces motor and memory impairment in mice.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review examines the role of heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) in COVID-19, highlighting its impact on immune modulation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Hsp60, a chaperone protein essential for protein folding and protection against cell stress, has been linked to COVID-19 pathogenesis through its interactions with the immune system and potential involvement in post-infectious autoimmune processes. One of the key aspects discussed is the phenomenon of molecular mimicry, wherein Hsp60 exhibits epitope similarity with a number of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, a circumstance that may potentially culminate in the induction of autoimmune responses. This mimicry has the potential to contribute to the development of autoimmune conditions, including Guillain–Barré syndrome and autoimmune thyroiditis, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The document discusses Hsp60’s role in endothelial damage and thromboembolic complications, suggesting it could serve as a biomarker for disease severity and a therapeutic target. It raises concerns about vaccine safety due to Hsp60’s structural similarity to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which may trigger autoimmune responses. The potential for Hsp60 to generate anti-tumor immunity is explored, indicating that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 might also target tumor cells with similar epitopes. Further research is necessary to understand Hsp60’s role in disease fully and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Abnormal immune responses are common clinical features in septic patients. γδ T cells, as innate immune cells, play an important role in host defense, immune surveillance, and homeostasis. However, the immune characteristics of γδ T cells in pediatric sepsis remain poorly understood. Methods In this study, we analyzed single-cell RNA high-throughput sequencing data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from pediatric septic patients. Results It demonstrates that γδ T cells exhibit a pro-inflammatory state with heightened immune responsiveness to pathogens in pediatric sepsis, as confirmed by the results of flow cytometric analysis showing elevated Th1 cytokine secretion, increased activation, and a propensity to differentiate into IL-17-producing (γδT17) cells during disease progression. Pseudotime analysis identified seven key genes potentially regulating the differentiation of γδ T cells to γδT17 subtype. Furthermore, cell-cell communication analysis revealed enhanced RETN-CAP1 binding between neutrophils and γδ T cells in pediatric sepsis, suggesting that neutrophil-derived resistin may promote γδ T-cell differentiation into the γδT17 subtype via CAP1 receptor binding. Conclusion This study presents analysis of a single-cell study on the immune status of γδ T cells in pediatric sepsis, highlighting their pivotal roles in pathogen response, inflammation propagation, and immune regulation. The observed differentiation toward the γδT17 subtype may facilitate neutrophil recruitment in this life-threatening condition. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of γδ T cells in pediatric sepsis could offer a new theoretical basis for novel therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It follows a dynamic course in which early hyperinflammation coexists and overlaps with progressive immune suppression, a process best described as immunodynamic disruption. Key mechanisms include extensive lymphocyte death, expansion of regulatory T cells, impaired antigen presentation, and persistent activation of inhibitory checkpoints such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). These changes reduce immune competence and increase vulnerability to secondary infections. Clinically, reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen–DR (HLA-DR) on monocytes and persistent lymphopenia have emerged as robust biomarkers for patient stratification and timing of immunomodulatory therapies. Beyond the acute phase, many survivors do not achieve full immune recovery but instead develop a Persistent Immune Remnant, defined as long-lasting immune, metabolic, and endothelial dysfunction despite apparent clinical resolution. Recognizing PIR emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring and biomarker-guided interventions to restore immune balance. To integrate these observations, we propose the SIMMP–Sepsis model (Sepsis-Associated Persistent Multiorgan Immunometabolic Syndrome), which links molecular dysfunction to clinical trajectories and provides a framework for developing precision immunotherapies. This perspective reframes sepsis not only as an acute crisis but also as a chronic immunometabolic syndrome, where survival marks the beginning of active immune restoration.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in which macrophages play a pivotal and multifaceted role. These highly plastic immune cells are key effectors in the immunopathology of MS, contributing to both inflammatory-driven demyelination and subsequent tissue repair. Historically, macrophage function was viewed through the binary lens of pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 polarization. However, recent research reveals a far more complex spectrum of activation states within the dynamic microenvironment of MS lesions. Understanding the intricate signals and molecular pathways that govern macrophage polarization in the CNS represents a critical frontier for therapeutic innovation. Interventions aimed at rebalancing macrophage phenotypes have yielded encouraging results in preclinical models, and some therapeutic agents are now advancing into clinical trials. Future investigations are focused on the diverse functions of macrophages in MS pathogenesis, including their involvement in oxidative stress, antigen presentation, and myelin debris clearance. A particularly innovative approach involves harnessing macrophages as cellular vehicles for targeted drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier, offering a potential solution to one of the most significant challenges in CNS therapeutics. The primary challenge now lies in the safe and effective clinical translation of these macrophage-centered therapies. Successfully navigating this transition from bench to bedside holds the potential to deliver transformative treatments that can halt disease progression and restore neurological function for individuals living with this debilitating disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in 2020 led to the immediate development of vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). First-generation (2020–2021) COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated high immunogenicity and efficacy, successfully reducing hospitalization, disease severity and COVID-19 related deaths. However, the initial clinical trials for these vaccines focused on overall healthy individuals, and generally excluded high risk populations, such as people with cancer. The SARS-CoV-2 VaccinE Response, Immunological eFfects and safetY in patients with Cancer (VERIFY-C) study formed a unique cohort in early 2021, to capture the initial immune response to BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer) vaccination in people with cancer, with or without ongoing/recent exposure to systemic cancer treatment. Fifty-three participants diagnosed with cancer were enrolled. Majority were non-Hispanic, Caucasian females. Patients under cancer treatment had significantly lower antibody responses than those without treatment at pre-second dose and 1-month post-second dose. The levels at 6-months post-second dose were similar between both groups. Patients under treatment had a significantly lower immune response 1-month post-second dose, with an increased immune response at 6-months post-second dose, suggesting a delayed immune response. Further investigations are needed to understand antibody functionality post-vaccination in these individuals.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with immune dysfunction, but how disease-intrinsic mechanisms in treatment-naive patients influence the coordination of adaptive responses to novel antigens remains unclear. Here, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell immunity in 38 treatment-naive CLL patients and 13 healthy controls (HCs) following vaccination. Despite significantly reduced total immunoglobulin levels compared to HCs, 94.7% of CLL patients developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, and 89.5% mounted IgA responses, with serum titers comparable to those of HCs. Virus-specific T cell responses, measured by IFN-γ release following antigen stimulation, were detected in 78.9% of patients. CLL patients had significantly more circulating CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells than HCs. These expansions correlated with B cell abundance, which, in untreated CLL, predominantly reflects malignant B cells. Notably, Tfh cell frequencies and absolute counts were highest in patients lacking a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, indicating a decoupling between Tfh expansion and functional antiviral immunity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that while SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses are largely preserved in treatment-naive CLL patients, disease-driven alterations in T cell composition may compromise the coordination and quality of antigen-specific T cell-mediated immunity.">

We report five patients diagnosed with breakthrough MIS-C despite COVID-19 immunisation, all within a limited time period at the beginning of the Omicron wave, to assess whether breakthrough MIS-C cases share the same TCR Vβ21.3 skewing seen in non-vaccinated MIS-C cases. We retrospectively reviewed five MIS-C patients hospitalised between December 2021 and April 2022 despite previous immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2, an mRNA vaccine against S-protein). Immunophenotyping, including TCR Vβ subset distribution, was performed in four patients.Patients (100% male, 12.2–17.2 years) had a natural breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection following prior immunisation (between August 2021 and February 2022). Recent infection was proven by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and/or IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein. Blood samples of four patients were available. All presented with Vβ21.3+ T cell expansion, similar to MIS-C patients and in contrast to vaccinated historical KD patients (n=10). The two patients with the earliest sampling post-illness displayed frequencies of Vβ21.3+ T cells exceeding the reference mean value+10×SD. These Vβ21.3+ T cells showed increased surface expression of activation (HLA-DR, CD38) and exhaustion (PD-1, TIM-3) markers.In conclusion, breakthrough MIS-C patients presented with features consistent with unvaccinated MIS-C patients, including the hallmark Vβ21.3+ T cell expansion, indicating that prior immunisation with an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan strain did not fully protect against MIS-C at the wave of a novel emerging variant early 2022.

        <tr id="Cardiac complications are among the most common and severe extrapulmonary manifestations of influenza virus infection, yet they are rarely recapitulated in mouse models without immunodeficiency. We found that influenza virus A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) carrying a mouse-adaptive amino acid substitution in the PB2 protein (E158A) disseminates to the heart in WT C57BL/6 mice, where it induces inflammation, electrical dysfunction, and fibrotic remodeling. Influenza virus-infected heart tissue was significantly altered in mitochondrial metabolism, extracellular matrix, circadian rhythm, and immunity pathways. Particularly striking was activation of gene expression downstream of the mitochondrial biogenesis-promoting AMPK/PGC-1α axis, which occurred late in infection but failed to reverse the repression of mitochondria-associated genes, suggesting an insufficient or delayed compensatory response. Accordingly, we administered AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) early in infection and observed restoration of mitochondria-associated gene levels, amelioration of cardiac electrical dysfunction and fibrosis, and improvement in survival without overt effects on lung function. Overall, the advent of an immunocompetent model for severe influenza-associated cardiac dysfunction revealed activation of AMPK signaling as a host-targeted metabolic intervention for mitigating virus-induced heart pathologies">

Methods We conducted whole-genome sequencing on samples from 129 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A panel of 21 nonsense mutations predicted to activate the NMD pathway was identified and analyzed. Statistical correlations with clinical severity were assessed, including multivariate analysis. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and interdependency analysis of mutation combinations were also performed. Results Five NMD-associated mutations (Variants 5, 6, 7, 9, and 15) showed significant associations with mild disease. These mutations, located in key SARS-CoV-2 genes, include Variant 5 (g.C5575G, T, synonymous substitution in ORF1ab), Variant 6 (g.T5653G, substitution in ORF1ab), Variant 7 (g.G6094GGACAGACTTT/GCCTACACGACGCTAATC, insertion in spike protein), Variant 9 (g.G6446GAATGA, insertion in spike protein), and Variant 15 (g.T10968TATATTGA, insertion in N protein). In the host-adjusted multivariable model, the presence of at least one NMD-inducing mutation was an independent protective factor (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.16–0.72, p = 0.005). However, after adjusting for SARS-CoV-2 lineage, this association was attenuated (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.03–13.84, p = 0.793). In the lineage-only model, Omicron infection showed higher odds of severe disease compared to Delta (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 0.77–4.77, p = 0.164). ROC analysis indicated limited predictive value for individual variants (AUC = 0.37–0.48), but specific combinations, such as Variants 5 and 7, markedly reduced severe case incidence (92.9–4.8%, p = 0.0001). Conclusion NMD-inducing nonsense mutations were associated with reduced COVID-19 severity in host-adjusted analyses, but this effect diminished after accounting for viral lineage, suggesting that variant distribution, particularly Omicron may influence these associations. Integrating viral genomic background with host and clinical data may enhance risk prediction and inform antiviral strategies.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Cytokine storm can result from uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokines released in SARS-CoV-2 infection that cause damage to several organs. Il-6 is one of the major mediators of cytokine storm. IFN-α2 has been reported to have anti-viral potential and the pre-infection levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been suggested to drive the fate of the disease. There is a paucity of information on how anti-viral cytokines at the onset of infection affect the disease progression. This study aims to profile IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-α2 expression levels for 44 days post-diagnosis and their effects on recovery.


METHODS
Peripheral venous blood was collected from 38 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants who came for diagnosis at the Center for Research on Emerging and Reemerging Diseases. IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-α2 levels were measured using a Luminex panel.


RESULTS
Males had higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load than females, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). Age-related variation was also observed, with individuals aged 40-60 showing significantly higher viral load than those over 60 (p=0.045). Cytokines analysis revealed that males had significantly higher levels of IFNα-2, IL-2, and IL-6 (p=0.0031, p=0.009, and p=0.022 respectively) than females upon diagnosis, with cytokines levels decreasing over time in males but increasing in females. Cytokine levels trended higher in symptomatic individuals, although differences were not significant.


CONCLUSION
These findings highlight the influence of sex, clinical status, and viral load on cytokine dynamics in COVID-19, with potential implications for understanding disease severity and immune response.">

        <tr id="Background: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has been pivotal in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, understanding vaccine-induced immunity in immunocompromised individuals remains critical, particularly how prior exposure to other coronaviruses modulates immune responses. The influence of previous infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as OC43, on SARS-CoV-2 immunity is not fully understood. This study evaluates antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination in hemodialysis patients (HD), transplant recipients (TR), and healthy controls (CO), accounting for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and baseline human coronavirus (HCoV) reactivity. Methods: We obtained longitudinal antibody measurements from 70 subjects (CO: n = 33; HD: n = 13; TR: n = 24) and assessed antibody kinetics across multiple post-vaccination time points using multivariate linear mixed modeling (MLMM). Results: Limited but measurable cross-reactivity was observed between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs, particularly the β-coronavirus OC43. Pre-existing immunity in healthy individuals modestly enhanced vaccine-induced anti-spike (S) IgG responses, supported by post-vaccination increases in SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly influenced anti-S and nucleocapsid (N) IgG responses but had limited impact on endemic HCoVs responses. Vaccine type and immune status significantly affected antibody kinetics. mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2) elicited stronger and more durable SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG responses than the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine, especially in immunocompetent individuals. Immunocompromised groups showed delayed or attenuated responses, with modest anti-S IgG cross-reactive boosting. Elevated anti-N IgG in CoronaVac recipients raised questions about its origin—infection or vaccine effects. MLMM identified key immunological and clinical predictors of antibody responses, emphasizing the critical role of host immune history. Conclusions: These findings highlight a constrained but meaningful role for HCoV cross-reactivity in SARS-CoV-2 immunity and vaccine responsiveness, underscore the need for infection markers unaffected by vaccination, and support development of broadly protective pan-coronavirus vaccines and tailored strategies for at-risk populations.">

        <tr id="Parrots, valued companion animals with a concerning conservation status, can act as reservoirs for zoonotic diseases. During various infections, systemic inflammation significantly impairs host health. However, the regulation of inflammatory responses in birds, particularly in cognitively advanced parrots, remains poorly understood. Here, we examine parrot systemic inflammation in response to virus-mimicking stimulation. In budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a novel model for neuroinflammation research, we induced sterile inflammation with synthetic poly(I:C) RNA and analysed dose-, time- and tissue-dependent gene expression patterns of key markers, including TLR3, NLRP3, CASP1, IL1B and IL6, during acute immune response. We report a significant relationship between cytokine expression (IL1B, IL6) in the intestine (local response) and brain (systemic response) that has not yet been described after viral stimulation in parrots. Peripheral IL6 expression was upregulated at 3–6 h after stimulation with poly(I:C). In the brain, multiple genes (TLR3, IL1B and IL6) showed activation early during the immune response. These findings highlight the susceptibility of parrots to neuroinflammation following viral infections, having specific relevance for basic research in neurobiology, immunology and behavioural science, and also veterinary research in psittacine birds. Our study provides a foundation for future comparative research on avian neuro-immune crosstalk and neuroinflammation-related behavioural disorders.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Sepsis, caused by an unbalanced host response to infection, remains a global health burden. The dysregulation between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is a primary driver of immune imbalance. As a central player in adaptive immunity, CD4+ T cells are crucial for maintaining this balance during sepsis by differentiating into various effector T cell subsets. Thus, elucidating the underlying mechanisms within the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance in CD4+ T cell subsets during sepsis is of great value. We first identified the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) as a significantly upregulated gene in CD4+ T cells from sepsis patients by conducting a comprehensive transcriptome meta-analysis. The expression of PIM1 was significantly elevated on CD4+ T cells from sepsis patients and was correlated with both SOFA and APACHE II scores. Moreover, we found that PIM1 promoted the differentiation of CD4+IFN-γ+ Th1 and CD4+IL-17A+ Th17 subsets while inhibiting the differentiation of CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs. Additionally, upon inhibiting PIM1 kinase activity in CD4+ T cells, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the cholesterol metabolism gene, ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), exhibited significant upregulation. More importantly, we found that the intracellular cholesterol content was decreased in CD4+ T cells after inhibiting the PIM1 kinase activity or knocking down PIM1. The portion of CD4+IFN-γ+ Th1 and CD4+IL-17A+ Th17 cells was recovered, and the CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs decreased after cholesterol supplementation to CD4+ T cells. These findings indicated that PIM1 may regulate the balance of Th1, Th17, and Treg subsets in a cholesterol-dependent manner in sepsis. IMPORTANCE This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance of CD4+ T cell subsets during sepsis. Our study provides evidence that PIM1 serves as a crucial regulator of sepsis-induced inflammation and elucidates that PIM1 participates in regulating the imbalance of Th1, Th17, and Treg subsets, further promoting inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance in sepsis. Additionally, the cholesterol metabolism, potentially mediated by ABCG1, is implicated in PIM1’s regulatory effect on the Th1, Th17, and Treg imbalance. Our study provides novel insights into the inflammatory imbalance during sepsis, which could facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the immune-inflammatory cascade in this condition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT: It has been five years since the first COVID-19 cases emerged in China. The infection spread extensively around the world, impacting millions and presenting a significant risk to public health, leading to the breakdown of healthcare systems in various countries. The COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and is a recent emergent virus that belongs to the beta (β)-coronaviruses. The presence of comorbidities significantly influenced the mortality rate among patients infected with COVID-19. For a while, it was believed that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was limited to respiratory tract invasion; however, more research indicated that the infection may also affect the central and peripheral neurological systems, among many other organs and systems. Encephalopathy, encephalitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are among the neurological side effects linked to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the pandemic began, COVID-19 treatment has advanced swiftly, mostly emphasizing antiviral and immunomodulatory medications. Remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are examples of antivirals that have been observed to be most effective when used initially in an illness (for instance, as outpatient treatment) and in instances of milder disease. When treating serious disease or critical illness, immunomodulatory treatments like dexamethasone, Janus kinase inhibitors, or interleukin-6 are most beneficial. Mass vaccination campaigns as a preventative measure are the most effective means of preventing this pandemic. In order to mitigate or lower the rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities, several vaccine platforms, such as vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA and mRNA vaccines), adenovirus-vectored vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and protein-based subunit vaccines, have been created and developed. This article mainly emphasizes the taxonomy and structural virology with the probable viral immuno-pathogenesis mechanism of SARS CoV-2. It also outlines the correlation between comorbidities and neurological complications, and lastly, it mentions the prophylaxis and vaccines used for treating COVID-19 patients.">

Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood.

We show during malaria age is associated with increased inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXCL9, along with CRP, and IDO, which associate with symptoms. In naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cells from adults have higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults are dominated by CCL2, while in children increased IL10 and enrichment of IL10 signaling pathways is detected. Findings identify age-dependent cellular mechanisms that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

        <tr id="Monitoring the presence and distribution of distinct immune cell populations is key in deciphering immunopathologic disease mechanisms. Considering the crucial role of myeloid cells in provoking hyperinflammatory responses associated with coronavirus disease 2019, a camelid-derived single-domain antibody specifically recognizing human signal-regulatory protein-α (SIRPα) as a biomarker for myeloid cells has been generated and radiolabeled with 64Cu, that is, [64Cu]copper-SIRPα-nanobody ([64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb), for in vivo PET imaging. In this study, this PET tracer was used and validated to monitor the temporal dynamics of inflammatory processes during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nonhuman primates. For further validation, the signal of [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb was compared with the signal of TSPO-targeting [18F]fluorine-N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide ([18F]F-DPA714). Methods: Six cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently monitored for 7 wk. We performed a baseline [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT before infection, followed by repetitive PET/CT on days 3, 10, 24, and 52 after infection covering the head, thorax, and abdominal region. Of the 6 macaques, 3 underwent additional TSPO-targeting [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT investigations at baseline and at days 2, 9, 23, and 51 after infection. Tracheal and nasal swabs were taken to monitor the course of infection, and changes in blood count and inflammatory mediators in the periphery blood were monitored. Results: Detection of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA from tracheal and nasal swab samples confirmed viral infection of all animals. CT scans identified initial pulmonary lesions 2 days after infection. [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT revealed increased tracer uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes of all animals, but not in the lung lesions, 3 days after infection. [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT showed increased uptake in both anatomically affected and unaffected lung tissues. The increased [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake in the spleen and bone marrow of all animals was more pronounced 3 and 7 wk after infection. We detected individual differences in [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake within the bone marrow and spleen, whereas [18F]F-DPA714 exhibited rather homogeneous uptake patterns. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb is a versatile tool for quantitative monitoring of whole-body distribution, temporal distribution, and accumulation dynamics of myeloid cell subpopulations even in moderately inflamed tissues and affected lymphatic organs during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) not only causes lung damage but also induces renal damage; however, there is currently no consensus on the key molecules and signaling pathways involved. Six rhesus macaques were divided into a control group and a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection group. Meanwhile, their kidneys were segmented into three regions: renal cortex (Cor), inner medulla (IM), and outer medulla (OM), and proteomics and phosphoproteomic analysis were conducted. Subsequently, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to identify key molecules associated with COVID-19. We established proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of Cor, OM,and IM of kidneys infected with SARS-CoV-2. All regions exhibited varying intensities of inflammatory reactions and metabolic perturbations, implicating pathways such as the IL-17 signaling pathway and the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the upregulation of proteins including ISG15, and S100A8/S100A9. By utilizing DrugBank, we identified 21 FDA-approved drugs targeting predicted kinases as candidates for treatment, which need to be verified in the future.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Immunoinhibitory molecules, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), contribute to T-cell exhaustion in chronic infections. In a sheep model of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, PD-L1 expression was correlated with BLV proviral load, and TIM-3 expression was upregulated in multiple T-cell subsets. Moreover, TIM-3 blockade, alone or combined with PD-L1 inhibition, enhanced T-cell activation and cytokine production, while PD-L1 blockade alone had limited effects. These findings demonstrate that TIM-3 plays a role in T-cell dysfunction in sheep and support the use of sheep as a model for evaluating immunotherapies targeting immunoinhibitory molecules in BLV infection and other chronic infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are accompanied by a cytokine storm with type I interferon (IFN) as the main driver. Besides epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and infiltrating dendritic cells are target cells for IAV. IAV are classified into different strains, defined by their major surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). So far, 19 HA subtypes and 11 NA subtypes are known. However, it is not well understood, why infection with certain IAV strains results in a cytokine storm with severe outcomes, while other IAV strains only cause mild infections. In order to address this question, we investigated six seasonal and five highly pathogenic avian IAV (HPAIV) strains using primary human ex vivo isolated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), as well as in vitro differentiated myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and macrophages (type M1 and M2). Our data reveal that IFN-α production by mDC and macrophages but not by pDC is dependent on productive infection with the respective IAV strain. In contrast to IFN-α production in pDCs, IFN-α production by mDC as well as M1 and M2 macrophages is mainly induced by HPAIV strains, indicating that other immune cells apart from pDC might have an impact on induction of type I interferon as the main driver of the cytokine storm in the patients and the severity of the associated disease. Our findings may provide insights into the viral tropism and host response upon infection with different IAV strains and improve the understanding of the accompanied pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ), are markedly elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis (ICI-M). Endomyocardial biopsies from these patients also show GBP-associated inflammasome overexpression. While both factors are implicated in ICI-M pathophysiology, their interplay and cellular targets remain poorly characterized. Our aim was to elucidate how ICI-M-associated cytokines affect the viability and inflammatory responses of endothelial cells (ECs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs) using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived models. ECs and CMs were differentiated from the same hiPSC line derived from a healthy donor. Cells were exposed either to IFN-γ alone or to an inflammatory cytokine cocktail (CCL5, GZMB, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α). We assessed large-scale transcriptomic changes via microarray and evaluated inflammatory, apoptotic, and cell death pathways at cellular and molecular levels. hiPSC-ECs were highly sensitive to cytokine exposure, displaying significant mortality and marked transcriptomic changes in immunity- and inflammation-related pathways. In contrast, hiPSC-CM showed limited transcriptional changes and reduced susceptibility to cytokine-induced death. In both cell types, cytokine treatment upregulated key components of the inflammasome pathway, including regulators (GBP5, GBP6, P2X7, NLRC5), a core component (AIM2), and the effector GSDMD. Increased GBP5 expression and CASP-1 cleavage mirrored the findings found elsewhere in endomyocardial biopsies from ICI-M patients. This hiPSC-based model reveals a distinct cellular sensitivity to ICI-M-related inflammation, with endothelial cells showing heightened vulnerability. These results reposition endothelial dysfunction, rather than cardiomyocyte injury alone, as a central mechanism in ICI-induced myocarditis. Modulating endothelial inflammasome activation, particularly via AIM2 inhibition, could offer a novel strategy to mitigate cardiac toxicity while preserving antitumor efficacy.">

        <tr id="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. Although it is traditionally viewed as a neuron-centric disease, neurodegeneration is increasingly linked to immunosenescence and age-related immune dysfunction, but the mechanisms connecting immune ageing to neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. In this review, we explore how metabolic reprogramming, especially the loss of metabolic plasticity in senescent immune cells, drives neuroinflammation in ALS. Senescent immune cells, including microglia and T cells, exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, redox imbalance, impaired autophagy, and altered nutrient-sensing pathways that impair their homeostatic and reparative capacities. These cells adopt a metabolically demanding pro-inflammatory phenotype, sustaining an inflammatory secretome while promoting glial activation and neuronal damage. Finally, we discuss how targeting immunometabolic pathways may offer new therapeutic opportunities to restore immune balance, mitigate neuroinflammation, and potentially slow ALS progression. Understanding the metabolic basis of immune ageing is essential for developing effective, age-tailored interventions for ALS.">

These disorders involve progressive neuronal loss and cognitive decline, with incompletely elucidated underlying mechanisms. Chronic neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to disease progression. The brain’s resident immune cells, microglia, are central to this inflammatory response. When overactivated, microglia and other immune cells, such as peripheral macrophages, can exacerbate inflammation and accelerate disease development. Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily that demonstrates high expression on microglia in the central nervous system. TREM2 serves a vital role in regulating phagocytosis, synaptic pruning, and energy metabolism. This review examines the functions of TREM2 in neurodegenerative diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target, aiming to inform future treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells represent a critical component of antiviral immunity, demonstrating remarkable adaptability during infections such as human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) and SARS-CoV-2. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics have revealed the clonally expanding NK cell populations with distinct functional profiles, blurring the traditional boundaries between innate and adaptive immunity. However, the functional heterogeneity and immunological significance of these clones remain incompletely understood. Our aim was to dissect clonal NK cell heterogeneity using published scRNA-seq datasets from hCMV-seropositive, seronegative, and COVID-19 patients, focusing on cluster-specific gene expression patterns. Our computational pipeline employed Seurat-based integration and high-resolution clustering of datasets from hCMV-seropositive (n = 5) and seronegative (n = 2) donors, along with COVID-19 patients (n = 2). We analyzed datasets using Seurat 5 in R. Quality-controlled data were normalized (SCTransform), integrated (batch-corrected), and clustered (UMAP). Differential gene expression (Wilcoxon test, log2FC 0.25, p-adj 0.05) and annotation were performed. In hCMV-seropositive individuals, we identified 12 transcriptionally distinct NK cell clusters exhibiting KLRC2 (NKG2C)-dependent organization, with specific clones showing either enhanced cytotoxic potential (marked by GZMB/GZMA upregulation), or unique inhibitory receptor profiles (variable KIR expression patterns). The hCMV-seronegative cohort displayed a simpler clonal structure with 9 clusters showing reduced KIR diversity but maintained distinct effector gene signatures. Analysis of COVID-19 patients revealed divergent clonal patterns: one patient showed reduced KLRC2 variability with prominent KLRC1 (NKG2A) expression, while another exhibited KIR heterogeneity without KLRC2 variation. Our analysis reveals distinct clonal NK cell populations in hCMV and COVID-19 contexts, characterized by divergent expression of activating and inhibitory receptors. These findings demonstrate infection-specific dynamics of clonal NK cell populations, highlighting their adaptive potential through differential receptor expression in antiviral responses.">

        <tr id="Post-sepsis syndrome (PSS) encompasses a range of long-term complications, including immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and neuromuscular impairment, that persist beyond the resolution of the acute septic episode. While these clinical phenotypes are increasingly recognized, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in the form of persistent mitochondrial senescence, is emerging as a potential unifying factor driving multiple PSS trajectories. Accumulating evidence suggests that damaged mitochondria not only lose their bioenergetic capacity but also actively contribute to chronic immune and inflammatory signalling. Based on this, we propose a dual-intervention strategy (“mitochondrial flush”) which involves the coordinated elimination of senescent mitochondria and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. The regenerative component, supported by established preclinical research on Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-Alpha (PGC-1α) activation, represents a partially developed therapeutic arm, while the selective clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria remains an area of active investigation. This concept raises important questions regarding regenerative capacity, therapeutic timing, and cellular resilience following critical illness. We further propose a working definition of PSS as a state of persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly driven by ongoing oxidative stress, which may underlie a broader range of clinical phenotypes than currently recognized. A deeper understanding of mitochondrial quality control may offer a new therapeutic framework for reversing the chronic physiological decline observed in sepsis survivors.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Tens of thousands of severe COVID-19 cases are hospitalized weekly in the U.S., often driven by an imbalance between antiviral responses and inflammatory signaling, leading to uncontrolled cytokine secretion. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is a known immune antagonist, but its role in macrophage-driven cytokine storms is unclear. We demonstrate that N functions in a pathway-specific manner, specifically amplifying nuclear factor κB-related transcripts upon Toll-like receptor 7/8 stimulation. Moreover, we show that this is a conserved feature of pathogenic coronaviruses, with the delta variant N being the most pro-inflammatory. Our interaction networks suggest the delta variant N drives inflammation through interactions with several stress granule-related proteins. Profiling of secreted cytokines revealed that supernatants from the delta variant N-expressing macrophages disrupt brain and heart endothelial barriers, implicating N in COVID-19-associated cognitive and cardiac complications. Our findings highlight N-mediated immune imbalance as a driver of severe COVID-19 and identify N as a promising therapeutic target to mitigate hyperinflammation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Survivors of COVID-19 frequently report psychiatric and cognitive sequelae. The origin of such sequelae has not been determined, as it has been a challenge to resolve whether these symptoms have a viral origin or are related to the contextual stressors associated with the pandemic. In the current study, we used a mouse model of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) to evaluate the neurobiological nature of the sequelae without the interference of the contextual effects on behavior following SARS-CoV-2 infection.


RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in behavioral deficits related to cognition but not anxiety- or depression-like behavior. The cognitive deficits were affected by the severity of the acute disease. Cytokine and chemokine levels as well as kynurenine pathway metabolites were significantly altered in the brains of infected mice. Both cytokine/chemokine levels and kynurenine pathway metabolites correlated with the severity of the acute disease. Microbiome taxonomic profiling revealed significant differences between groups, suggesting that specific bacterial species may be associated with the development of PASC.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to cognitive deficits in PASC, influenced by the severity of the acute disease. In contrast, PASC anxiety- and depression-like behavior was not related to the viral infection itself. This could indicate that PASC anxiety and depression is more linked to contextual stressors related to the pandemic, rather than the viral infection per se. Additionally, our results points to a role of cytokines and in particular metabolites of the kynurenine pathway in PASC, suggesting their potential as biomarkers and targets for pharmacological treatment.">

        <tr id="Background: This study aimed to analyze metabolic changes in blood samples from patients with confirmed COVID-19 to explore the correlation between metabolomics and cytokines in survivors and non-survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the complex biochemical and immunometabolic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for elucidating the pathophysiology and virulence of COVID-19. Methods: This study included 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 40 healthy controls. Serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS), and cytokine levels were measured using ELISA. Results: Our study defined three clear metabolic phenotypes among survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19 compared with healthy controls, which might be related to mortality, severity, and disease burden. A strong relationship was observed between certain inflammatory markers, including IL-1β, IL-2, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-17, and GM-CSF, as well as several metabolites, particularly in COVID-19 non-survivors, such as LysoPCs, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and serotonin. Different metabolite-cytokine correlation patterns were observed according to patient outcomes, indicating unique correlations between metabolic and immune responses in survivors and non-survivors. Metabolic phenotypes were associated with clinical outcomes, comorbidities, and sex-related differences. Kynurenine and related metabolites of tryptophan metabolism were closely correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and mortality. Compared with survivors and healthy controls, non-survivors displayed higher IL-6, together with distinct metabolic changes. These included increased kynurenine through the IDO1 pathway, elevated glucose and lactate reflecting hyperglycolysis and energy stress, and higher xanthosine from purine turnover. Stronger cytokine–metabolite correlations in this group point to tightly linked immunometabolic activation. Conclusions: Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct metabolic phenotypes that could be associated with the severity and inflammation levels of COVID-19. Correlation analysis between metabolites and cytokines demonstrated strong intercorrelations between specific metabolites and cytokines, indicating a strong interrelationship between inflammatory markers and metabolic alterations. Specific metabolic pathways associated with cytokines and their clinical relevance may serve as potential therapeutic targets.">

To determine the function of soluble Program Death-Ligand1 (sPD-L1) in SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron variant) infection progression and its relation with biomarkers.A case-control study (43 COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls) was tested for the Omicron variant infection by real-time PCR, and the biomarker and sPD-L1 were measured with an ELISA kit. Median sPD-L1 levels in infected individuals were significantly higher than in healthy controls (1079 pg/mL vs. 618.8 pg/mL; p<0.0001). According to the two-tailed Fisher exact test, 93.3 % of mild-moderate individuals had an sPDL-1 level below the median of 1079 pg/ml, indicating minimal production. In contrast, significantly high levels were found in 76.9 % of severe-critical patients. sPD-L1 levels were strongly associated with viral load (Ct value) (p< 0.0001) and increased with older age (p = 0.024) along with CRP and Ferritin levels, serving as predictive indicators for infection progression. sPD-L1 may play a role in developing infection, together with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants, high viral load (low Ct value), the aged group, and severe infection, and with clinical symptoms. Additional research is needed to decrease sPD-L1-based interferon production.">

        <tr id="Abstract Japanese encephalitis is a neuroinflammatory condition caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2) is a key modulator of glucose metabolism. The role of PKM2 in the autoimmune response and inflammation is now increasingly being acknowledged. However, its role in modulating virus replication has not been explored. In the current study, we have explored the role of PKM2 in JEV replication. Our results show that endogenous PKM2 expression is significantly upregulated in JEV-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, overexpression and knockdown studies substantiate the negative effect of PKM2 on JEV replication. Additionally, JEV infection induced signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation in the infected neuronal cells. Overexpression of PKM2 enhanced STAT3 activation, while its downregulation reduced STAT3 activation in the JEV-infected neuronal cells. The results suggested that the overexpression of PKM2 exhibited elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, whereas the downregulation of PKM2 decreased their expression. The in silico studies revealed the potential interaction between PKM2 and non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which was subsequently validated in vitro by co-immunoprecipitation assay. The microscopic studies also unveiled the cellular co-localization of PKM2 and NS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells. Altogether, these findings indicate that PKM2 negatively regulates JEV replication by inducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β. The study also establishes PKM2 as a binding partner of the NS1 protein. Thus, the study paves the path towards understanding the multifaceted role of PKM2 in JEV pathology.">

        <tr id="In response to an infection, the host T cell compartment develops immunological memory to ensure rapid responses upon re-infection with the same pathogen. However, these memory responses can also modulate immune reactions to unrelated pathogens through bystander activation. Herein, T cells are activated in an antigen-independent manner, often triggered by innate cytokines or Toll-like receptor ligands. To uncover new strategies for modulating immune responses, it is essential to deepen our understanding of this alternative mechanism of T cell activation, particularly in humans. Therefore, we studied the response of human CD8+ T cells to innate bystander stimuli in vitro. Thereby, we measured the induction of activation markers and proliferation using flow cytometry, and depleted or blocked several potential modulatory components to identify mediators of bystander CD8+ T-cell responses. Our study demonstrates that CD8+ T cells can be activated as bystander cells in response to innate stimuli present during a viral infection, including IL-15, IFN-α, and TLR7/8 and 9 agonists (R848 and CpG). Depletion experiments demonstrated that these bystander responses are dependent on monocytes and CD4+ T cells. In addition, we revealed that the bystander responses to the innate stimuli are highly reliant on IL-2 signaling. Altogether, our study underscores the pivotal role of IL-2 in mediating bystander responses of CD8+ T cells to innate stimuli, revealing a novel mechanism of immune response modulation during viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background Pulmonary infections, ranging from mild respiratory issues to severe multiorgan failure, pose a major global health threat. The immune response in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and COVID-19 influences disease severity and outcomes, but molecular pathogenesis differs across pathogens. Comparisons of plasma cytokine profiles between CAP and COVID-19 are limited. Analyzing these profiles with machine learning and bioinformatics could reveal subtle patterns and improve our understanding of immune responses in both conditions. Methods We conducted a novel case–control study to profile cytokine levels in patients with CAP and COVID-19. Age- and sex-matched cohorts included 39 patients with CAP, 39 with COVID-19, and 20 healthy controls. We measured 384 plasma cytokine levels using proximity extension assays and analyzed differences between cohorts with conventional statistical methods, bioinformatics and machine learning. Results Median ages of the cohorts were comparable (P = 0.797). COVID-19 patients exhibited a higher prevalence of hematologic disease (P = 0.047), increased corticosteroid use (P = 0.040), and reduced antibiotic use (P = 0.012). Clinical outcomes, including mortality, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury, were similar between groups. Both cohorts showed comparable absolute circulating cytokine profiles but distinct profiles relative to healthy controls. Machine learning identified a model of twelve cytokines that distinguished CAP from COVID-19 with a classification accuracy of 0.71 (SD 0.20). Gene ontology and enrichment analysis revealed differences in cytosolic and nuclear functions, intracellular signaling, stress responses, and cell cycle processes between patient cohorts and healthy controls. Enriched GO pathways showed that CAP pathways were positively associated with leukocyte counts and ARDS development, while COVID-19 pathways were negatively associated with ARDS and positively with platelet counts. Conclusions This case–control study provides insights into cytokine profiles related to CAP and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Although absolute circulating cytokine levels showed no significant differences between the groups, machine learning identified a model of twelve proteins that effectively distinguished the cohorts. Gene ontology and enrichment analyses also revealed distinct dysregulated pathways with differing associations with clinical variables in each cohort. These findings underscore the complexity and variability of cytokine responses in pulmonary infections.

With the discovery of multiple phenotypical and functional variants of neutrophils in sepsis, the heterogeneity of neutrophils is crucial, as it impacts the effectiveness of the immune response and the overall outcome of sepsis. Various genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome properties may contribute to this heterogeneity. Multi-omics approaches unveil complex details of neutrophil behavior in the context of sepsis, highlighting how neutrophil phenotypes are differentially recruited and activated in response to various stimuli. The present review aimed to provide an overview of the differences in neutrophil phenotypes and functions during sepsis, focusing on neutrophil heterogeneity identified via multi-omics methods.

        <tr id="Long COVID (LC) affects approximately 10% of individuals post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms persisting beyond 12 weeks. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear, and current models often focus on pre-existing comorbidities.This cohort study aimed to identify robust biomarkers and clarify LC pathogenesis through a comprehensive analysis performed in 32 LC individuals 26 months post-infection compared with 35 fully recovered individuals recruited between March and July 2022. Blood and fecal samples were collected, and multiple parameters associated with immune dysfunction, endothelial damage, bacterial translocation, and coagulation alterations, alongside signs of viral persistence and sociodemographic and clinical features, were analyzed.Although viral RNA was undetected on blood or stool, elevated plasma IgG against the nucleocapsid may indicate frequent reinfections, greater infection severity, or delayed immune normalization. Increased levels of prothrombin, thrombin, fibrinogen, sEPCR, and CRP pointed to persistent endothelial dysfunction and coagulation imbalance. Lower levels of the bactericidal protein REG3A suggest potential disruptions in mucosal immune response. We found no major differences in traditional comorbidities, highlighting that LC may stem from distinct pathogenic mechanisms beyond pre-existing conditions. Importantly, our study revealed impaired humoral immunity and identified an association between vaccine heterogeneity and increased LC risk, emphasizing the relevance of consistent vaccination strategies. A Random Forest model using the measured biomarkers achieved 100% accuracy in classifying LC individuals, reinforcing their diagnostic potential.These findings support a multifactorial model of LC involving immune dysregulation and persistent endothelial damage that led to coagulation abnormalities and a pro-thrombotic profile, supporting that LC is more closely related to a sustained, uncontrolled inflammatory response rather than immunodeficiency, and underscoring the value of multidimensional biomarker profiling for guiding clinical management and prevention strategies.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to far-reaching consequences. The changes caused in COVID-19 patients may persist for more than 6-12 months after acute phase of the disease promoting post-COVID disorders of immune system. Patients who have had acute COVID-19 in both mild and severe forms suffer from various manifestations of post-COVID syndrome. However, the severity of these manifestations is quite variable. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of lung damage extent in acute period of COVID-19 on the severity of clinical manifestations in post-COVID syndrome as exemplified by immune-mediated syndromes, i.e., autoimmune disorders, proliferative conditions, and allergopathology. 131 patients who had who had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were examined. Anamnestic data from outpatient cards of patients were used for the study. Using the ELISA diagnostics method, IgA, IgM, IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2, complement components C1q, C3a, C5a were determined. The studies revealed a connection between the severity of post-COVID syndrome and the severity of the acute COVID-19 course. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able of activating complement, and this activation persists for a long time (more than six months). This finding explains presence of clinical manifestations of post-COVID syndrome in individuals who have had a mild acute form of COVID-19 without CT-detected lung damage without phenotypes of immune system damage that we have previously identified (congenital – decreased expression of CD46 on T lymphocytes and decreased expression of CD46 on NK cells, and acquired – decreased level of T-cytotoxic lymphocytes and impaired level of B-cells CD45+CD3-CD19+CD5+CD27+). The data obtained indicate that the examination of post-COVID patients should be carried out not only by their clinical characteristics, but also by assessing markers of their immune system in order to make a correct diagnosis and prescribe etiological and pathogenetic therapy, including immune therapy. Conclusions: 1. Autoimmune, proliferative and allergic diseases are directly related to disorders of the immune system. The severity of autoimmune disorders in the post-COVID period is more associated with basic corticosteroid therapy (GCS) both for the treatment of autoimmune processes and for the treatment of COVID-19 (except of treating autoimmune thyroiditis). GCS treatment used in acute period of infection reduced the number of recurrenct disorders. The situation is the opposite in rheumatoid arthritis: the use of GCS in the acute period of infection in patients already on basic corticosteroid therapy subsequently leads to an increase in the number of relapses in post-COVID patients. 2. In post-COVID patients, we revealed a trend towards an increase in the most clinically severe allergopathology: firstly, in all groups (52%) in the post-COVID period, exacerbations of such pathologies as Quincke’s edema, urticaria, anaphylaxis, vasculitis, alveolitis, and bronchiolitis became more frequent. These findings suggest that the worse condition of these patients in the post-COVID period was influenced by the past SARS-CoV-2 infection Allergic skin lesions were in second place in terms of the frequency of exacerbations (about 28%). 3. There is a tendency towards an increased frequency of proliferative diseases exacerbations in patients with more severe forms of acute COVID-19 infection. It should also be noted that the percentage of such patients is quite high, from 31.6% to 48%. 4. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect the complement activation system, thus explaining clinical manifestations of post-COVID syndrome in the persons who had a mild form of COVID-19 without evidence of lung damage immune system affection. Our data indicate that the examination of post-COVID patients should be carried out not only by assessing their clinical characteristics, but also by examining the state of the immune system in such patients in order to make a correct diagnosis and administer etiological and pathogenetic therapy, including immune therapy.">

With recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, a growing body of research has revealed that this communication is highly dynamic, shifting across states of health, aging, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. In this review, we synthesize the current findings on intercellular communication networks involving neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and other glial populations in the CNS across four major states: healthy homeostasis, aging, demyelinating diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We focus on how changes in intercellular communication contribute to the maintenance or disruption of CNS integrity and function. Mechanistic insights into these signaling networks have revealed new molecular targets and pathways that may be exploited for therapeutic intervention. By comparing the intercellular signaling mechanisms across different disease contexts, we underscore the importance of CNS crosstalk not only as a hallmark of disease progression, but also as a potential gateway for precision therapy.">

Chronic active white matter lesions, identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1)-like and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite chronic B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. CSF:serum protein ratios revealed compartmentalized myeloid activation in cases with PRL. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.">

        <tr id="Pyroptosis is a mode of inflammatory cell death, characterized by cell membrane rupture and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Pyroptosis is a critical part of the innate immune response and acts as a defense mechanism against different types of pathogens, including viruses. Several respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, and SARS-CoV-2, have been shown to trigger pyroptosis through distinct mechanisms. While pyroptosis is beneficial to the host by controlling virus replication and eliminating infected cells, the exaggerated induction of pyroptosis can be harmful and cause significant tissue damage, such as that to the lung tissue during infection with respiratory viruses. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and the role pyroptosis plays during respiratory virus infections could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to reduce the morbidity caused by these infections. In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge obtained on the pathophysiological role of pyroptosis during different respiratory viral infections as well as some experimental approaches to regulating its detrimental effects to the host.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 has caused more than 7 million deaths worldwide, and according to the World Health Organization, it continues to result in more than 1000 reported deaths per month at the time of this writing. It is crucial to understand the immune response to COVID-19 since the virus continues to persist. Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in the immune defense against viral infections, including COVID-19. While it is well documented that infected patients have a reduction in lymphocytes and NK cells, gaps in knowledge exist regarding the function of NK cells. To study the function of NK cells in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, peripheral blood was obtained from patients admitted to the medical (non-ICU) wards at a large tertiary hospital. We demonstrated a decrease in the mature cytotoxic subset of NK cells within the peripheral blood of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We also observed a notable reduction in the cytotoxic function of NK cells against tumor targets. We examined the mechanisms leading to NK cell killing. We found reductions in the intracellular levels of effector molecules, the degranulation of cytotoxic granules, and the extracellular concentrations of released effector molecules. We identified dysfunctional intracellular granule trafficking required to position the granules for degranulation, which would be consistent with the reduced release of effector molecules. We found clusters of inhibitory receptors were upregulated in subsets of NK cells, in keeping with inhibition of cytotoxicity. Additionally, males with COVID-19 showed NK cell defects compared to healthy males, while no significant differences were observed in females. Our findings highlight defects in cytolytic effector molecules, granule trafficking and release, and increased expression of inhibitory receptors on NK cells in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, in addition to a sex difference in cytolytic function, which contributes to defective NK cell function in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Abstract The pathology of severe COVID-19 is due to a hyperinflammatory immune response persisting after viral clearance. To understand how the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is regulated to avoid severe COVID-19, we tested relevant immunoregulatory cytokines. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-4 were neutralized upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (CMA3p20), a model of mild disease; lung inflammation was quantified by histology and flow cytometry at early and late time points. Mild weight loss and lung inflammation including consolidation and alveolar thickening were evident 3 d postinfection (dpi), and inflammation persisted to 7 dpi. Coinciding with early monocytic infiltrates, CCL2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were transiently produced 3 dpi, while IL-12 and CCL5 persisted to 7 dpi, modeling viral and inflammatory phases of disease. Neutralization of TGF-β, but not IL-10 or IL-4, significantly increased lung inflammatory monocytes and elevated serum but not lung IL-6. Neutralization of IL-4 prolonged weight loss and increased early perivascular infiltration without changing viral titer. Anti-IL-4 reduced expression of Arg1, a gene associated with alternative activation of macrophages. Neutralizing TGF-β and IL-4 had differential effects on pathology after virus control. Lung perivascular infiltration was reduced 7 dpi by neutralization of IL-4 or TGF-β, and periairway inflammation was affected by anti-TGF-β, while alveolar infiltrates were not affected by either. Anti-IL-4 prolonged IL-12 to 7 dpi along with reduced IL-10 in lungs. Overall, the immunoregulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-4 dampen initial inflammation in this mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that promotion of immunoregulation could help patients in early stages of disease.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, immune-mediated neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, characterized by widespread demyelination, axonal injury, and progressive neurological impairment. The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis involves complex interactions between immune cells and central nervous system resident cells, with oligodendrocytes (the myelin-producing glial cells) occupying a central role in both the disease’s onset and progression. Oligodendrocyte dysfunction, including diminished regenerative capacity, heightened vulnerability to inflammatory cytokines, and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, contributes significantly to the failure of remyelination observed in chronic multiple sclerosis lesions. Key factors such as microglial activation, T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and altered signaling pathways affecting oligodendrocyte progenitor cell maturation are explored in depth. Some therapeutic strategies under investigation encompass the use of pharmacological agents, cell-based interventions, and modulation of both the extracellular matrix and the immune microenvironment. Advancing our understanding of oligodendrocyte biology, along with the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that impede effective remyelination, is critical for the development of innovative, targeted therapies aimed at attenuating neurodegeneration and enhancing long-term clinical outcomes in patients with multiple sclerosis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a major arthropod‐borne pathogen, endemic in over 100 countries and posing global health challenges. While innate immune responses and viral evasion mechanisms have been extensively studied in animal models and mononuclear cells, severe dengue can affect multiple tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS), leading to neurological manifestations. However, the CNS immune response remains poorly understood. This study analyzed molecules linked to innate immunity in CNS lesions from fatal dengue cases. Histopathological examination of the cerebral cortex revealed marked neuronal damage—chromatolysis, pyknotic nuclei—accompanied by microglial hyperplasia, white matter demyelination, perivascular inflammation, vascular congestion, vasogenic edema, and occasional hemorrhage or meningitis. DENV antigen was detected in endothelial cells of cortical and leptomeningeal vessels and in glial cells or macrophages. Immunohistochemistry revealed altered expression of innate immune markers: RIG‐I was sparsely expressed, STING was absent, and IFN‐α/β levels were reduced compared to controls. Notably, IRF2 expression was markedly elevated, with strong labeling in neurons, glial, and endothelial cells. These findings suggest an atypical pattern of immune activation in the CNS during severe dengue and highlight a potential role for IRF2 in modulating cerebral immune responses, offering new insights into the neuropathogenesis of dengue.">

        <tr id="Peroxisomes are membrane-bounded organelles that contribute to a range of physiological functions in eukaryotic cells. In the central nervous system (CNS), peroxisomes are implicated in several vital homeostatic functions including, but not limited to, reactive oxygen species signaling and homeostasis; generation of critical myelin sheath components (including ether phospholipids); biosynthesis of neuroprotective docosahexaenoic acid; breakdown of neurotoxic metabolites (such as very-long chain fatty acids); and, intriguingly, glial activation and response to inflammatory stimuli. Indeed, peroxisomes play a critical role in modulating inflammatory responses and are key regulators of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein-mediated response to infections. The importance of peroxisomes in CNS physiology is exemplified by the peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), a spectrum of inherited disorders of peroxisome assembly and/or abundance, that are characterized in part by neurological manifestations ranging from severe cerebral malformations to vision and hearing loss, depending on the individual disorder. Recently, peroxisome dysfunction has been implicated in neurological diseases associated with neuroinflammation including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease while also contributing to the pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses including SARS-CoV-2, Human Pegivirus, HIV-1 and Zika virus. In the present review, we examine the diverse roles that peroxisomes serve in CNS health before reviewing more recent studies investigating peroxisome dysfunction in inflammatory brain disorders and also highlight potential peroxisomal targets for diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

Among adaptive immune cells, CD4⁺ T cells have emerged as central regulators of neuroinflammatory processes, acting as a double-edged sword that can be either neuroprotective or neurotoxic. This review focuses on the roles of major CD4⁺ T cell subsets-Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tregs-in modulating the immune landscape following TBI, with an emphasis on their temporal dynamics, phenotypic plasticity, and therapeutic potential. We examine how blood-brain barrier disruption and innate immune activation facilitate T cell infiltration into the central nervous system, and outline the cytokine networks and signaling pathways that orchestrate CD4⁺ T cell differentiation and functional polarization. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have provided new insights into the transcriptional heterogeneity of CD4⁺ T cells post-TBI, offering novel angles for therapeutic targeting. In addition, we assess current strategies for targeting CD4⁺ T cells therapeutically and examine translational challenges, particularly the translational gap between animal models and human disease. To provide a focused synthesis, this review does not delve into all immune cell types or other aspects of neuroinflammation that may also play significant roles in TBI.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular disease, the current leading cause of death worldwide, is a multifactorial disorder that involves a strong contribution of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Overactivation of the immune system and inappropriate secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to vascular impairments and the development of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and peripheral artery disease. Lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells can all secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. This makes it challenging to isolate a specific subset of immune cells, particularly cytokines, and their contribution to vascular dysfunction remains difficult to elucidate. To solve this problem, our laboratory has developed the novel “immune cell-aorta” co-culture system described herein. This experimental protocol enables investigators to isolate an immune cell of interest and identify the cytokine(s) at the origin of vascular alterations. Key features • Novel ex vivo approach combining the culture of one population of immune cells with blood vessels. • No direct contact between the cells and the blood vessels; the model enables studying the role of immune cell–derived factors or cytokines on vascular function. • Blood vessels can subsequently be used for functional (wire/pressure myography), molecular (western blot, quantitative real-time RT-PCR), and histological studies.">

        <tr id="Background Elite controllers can spontaneously control HIV-1 infection without antiretroviral treatment but remain at risk of developing non-AIDS-related conditions. The adaptive immune system is key in mediating spontaneous viral control; however, the innate immune response remains understudied. We assessed the quality of the innate immune responses by evaluating the phenotype and function of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in South African adults living with HIV (PWH). Methodology A total of 73 black South Africans were included in this study. Of these, 55 were living with HIV and included 16 individuals with spontaneous viral control (PWHEC), 20 HIV progressors (PWHPROG), and 19 individuals suppressed on ART (PWHART). Eighteen individuals without HIV infection (PWOHHIV-) served as the control group. Monocyte subsets, T cell and monocyte activation and the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) by monocytes, myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells were analyzed using multicolour flow cytometry following stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR)4 (LPS), TLR7/8 (CL097), and TLR9 (CpG-ODN2216) ligands. Plasma biomarkers, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and D-dimer were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Our findings show a reduced expression of CD86 on monocytes of PWHEC (p=0.04) compared to PWOHHIV-. A reduced frequency of the classical monocyte (CD14+CD16) subset in PWHEC (p=0.02) and PWHPROG (p=0.05) compared to PWOHHIV-. TNF-α and IL-1β production was lower in monocytes and mDCs of PWHEC compared to PWOHHIV- post-stimulation with TLR4, and TLR7/8 (all p<0.05). Increased sCD14 levels in PWHEC compared to PWOHHIV- (p=0.01) indicate persistent immune activation, whereas increased D-dimer levels in PWHPROG compared to PWHART (p=0.01) and PWHEC (p=0.04) suggest higher inflammation in PWHPROG. Conclusion PWHEC exhibits similar immune responses as other PWH including PWHPROG, their innate immune profiles are characterized by lower levels of monocyte activation, reduced levels of classical monocytes, reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and elevated biomarkers associated with unfavourable disease outcomes. These findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring and potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate chronic inflammation in PWHEC. Furthermore, it expands our understanding of complex innate immune cell responses in PWHEC.">

Although the role of DCs in HIV transmission is well established, the recent advent of high-parameter, single-cell detection technologies, coupled with improved cell isolation techniques, has led to the rapid reclassification of the DC landscape, particularly within human barrier tissues. The identification of new subsets introduces the challenge of incorporating previously understood transmission principles with new, cell-specific, functional nuances to identify the key DCs responsible for facilitating HIV infection. This review explores the history of research linking DCs with HIV transmission as well as our understanding of how HIV manipulates DC biology to achieve this purpose. Furthermore, it provides an up-to-date understanding of the antigen-presenting cell landscape within human anogenital tissues and how each subset contributes to sexual transmission. Uncovering the cells and biological processes responsible for the sexual transmission of HIV is a fundamental step in the pursuit of an HIV vaccine and better prophylaxis to block infection.">

These cells employ unique antigen recognition mechanisms to trigger rapid immune responses. γδ T cells facilitate early pathogen elimination and immune regulation, whereas MAIT cells detect microbial metabolites and modulate the systemic inflammation. NKT cells balance immune homeostasis through dual pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This review classifies these subsets and examines their sepsis-related functions alongside immunotherapies targeting them, such as cytokine manipulation, immunomodulators, and checkpoint inhibitors. Elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying sepsis could advance therapies that restore immune equilibrium and potentially improve clinical outcomes. Future studies should unravel the interactions between unconventional T cells and broader immune networks while translating the findings into practical treatments. Understanding the dynamic roles of these cells provides pathways for tailored interventions in sepsis management.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive, chronic, and highly disabling neuroinflammatory disorder characterized by demyelination and T cell–driven inflammation. Pathogenic T cells play a central role in MS, but effective therapeutic targeting remains challenging. Here, we identified ankyrin repeat domain–containing protein 55 (ANKRD55) as a key regulator of T cell function by single-cell transcriptomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and blood from MS patients. ANKRD55 was predominantly expressed in CD4+ T cells in both compartments. Genetic ablation of Ankrd55 led to a robustly reduced disease severity and neuroinflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used animal model for MS. Furthermore, T cell–specific deficiency of Ankrd55 significantly impaired Th1 polarization and Th17 differentiation, reducing EAE pathogenicity. Mechanistically, we found that Ankrd55 deficiency disrupted T cell receptor (TCR) signaling integrity. We demonstrated that ANKRD55 regulates the formation of the immune synapse, an essential prerequisite for TCR activation, by interacting with subunits of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 (CCT) complex and modulating its activity, enhancing its assembly by competing with CCT5 for binding to TCP1, CCT3, and CCT6. This facilitates proper microtubule organization and TCR activation. These findings establish ANKRD55 as a critical regulator of TCR signaling and highlight its therapeutic potential in pathogenic T cell–driven autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Background The complement system is an important defense mechanism against pathogens, including viruses. In COVID-19, evidence suggests that hyperactivation of the complement system can lead to tissue damage and provoke dysregulation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in vascular damage observed in severe COVID-19. There is still little evidence regarding the role of plasma levels of these molecules in the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods The study included individuals 18 years of age or older with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, admitted to two referral hospitals in the Northeast Region of Brazil between August 2020 and July 2021. Plasma samples were collected within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were followed up until discharge, and complications during hospitalization were duly recorded. Plasma levels of the following complement proteins were determined by Luminex: C2, C3, C3b/iC3b, C4, C4b, C5, C5a, MBL, C1q, factor I, factor D, factor B, and factor H. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to correct the results according to possible confounding factors. Results The study included 267 patients (134 critical and 133 severe), with mean ages of 54 and 52 years, respectively. Plasma levels of C2, C5a, factor B, and factor D were significantly higher in patients who required intensive care unit admission, required ventilatory support, developed sepsis, developed cardiorespiratory arrest, or developed acute kidney failure. On the other hand, C4b level was lower in patients who developed complications. Complement proteins were significantly associated with laboratory parameters related to coagulation and kidney function. Conclusion These findings show that the complement system is associated with COVID-19 complications and laboratory parameters of coagulation and kidney function. These results suggest that these molecules may be potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in the clinical progression of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with an overactive immune response, contributing to disease severity. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays a central role in mediating inflammatory responses during viral infections, including COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES

This computational reanalysis explores the critical involvement of NF-κB signaling, particularly through toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and noncanonical pathways, in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, immune activation, and cytokine storm. We also discuss the crosstalk between NF-κB and other signaling pathways in the context of COVID-19, and summarize current and potential therapeutic strategies targeting NF-κB.

METHODS

An extensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, TLR signaling, NF-κB pathway activation, noncanonical NF-κB signaling, and anti-inflammatory drug interventions were analyzed and synthesized.

RESULTS

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, often facilitated by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease activity. This viral entry triggers downstream immune signaling cascades, especially through TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8. TLR engagement activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. NF-κB signaling exhibits extensive crosstalk with other pathways, including Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome (NLRP3) activation, contributing to cytokine storm and lung injury. Several pharmacological agents, including corticosteroids, Inhibitor of κB Kinase ( IKK) inhibitors, and repurposed drugs like dexamethasone and resveratrol, show potential in mitigating NF-κB-mediated inflammation.

CONCLUSION

NF-κB signaling serves as a pivotal mediator of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and immune dysregulation. Targeting this pathway—particularly its noncanonical branches and TLR-mediated activation—offers promising therapeutic avenues. Understanding NF-κB crosstalk with other immune pathways may yield synergistic drug targets to improve COVID-19 outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract INTRODUCTION Inflammatory bowel disease triggers extraintestinal manifestations, including in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the direct impact of peripheral inflammation on the CNS is largely unknown. METHODS Using a mouse model of colitis with pain and anxiety‐like behavior, we investigated the intricate pathogenic link between colonic inflammation, disruptions in circadian rhythmicity and impaired glymphatic circulation. RESULTS By in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, we observed a derangement of brain fluid dynamics, with a significant enlargement of the cerebral lateral ventricles and waste deposition within the brain parenchyma. Proteomics revealed changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, enriched in proteins related to inflammation, immune response, complement, neuronal, and lipid metabolic pathways. Alterations in brain metabolite concentrations and in inhibitory control mechanisms and excitatory transmission were detected. DISCUSSION Colonic inflammation induces remodeling in CSF volume distribution, clearance, and metabolism, with derangement of the crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes, priming synaptopathy. HIGHLIGHTS An acute peripheral inflammatory trigger affects the central level by remodeling central nervous system (CNS) fluid distribution and priming early signals of synaptopathy. A single dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) challenge disrupts the circadian clock machinery and alters CNS fluid distribution, a so far neglected system, thereby impairing glymphatic clearance of waste products and indirectly altering neurotransmitter release dynamics. These combined effects ultimately impact brain function, extending to the regulation of behavior. Understanding how an intestinal inflammatory insult may derange the daily rhythm of the mechanisms controlling brain waste disposal may help identify specific groups of subjects at high risk of developing neurological disorders.">

        <tr id="Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex, multisystem disorder characterized by chronic inflammatory processes. The development of effective immunomodulatory therapies for PD requires a novel and comprehensive understanding of the coordinated interactions between central and peripheral innate and adaptive immune responses that are initiated and evolve throughout disease onset and progression. Immune system dysregulation is a defining feature of PD, with a substantial body of evidence indicating pathological alterations in both central and peripheral immune responses that evolve dynamically over the course of the disease. In PD, central inflammation is defined by the activation of astrocytes, microglia and T-cell responses within the central nervous system. In contrast, peripheral inflammation involves the activation of T-cell signaling and innate immune cells in the enteric nervous system, circulatory system and gastrointestinal tract. However, the underlying mechanisms of this inflammation in PD-associated diseases remain unclear, and identifying the initial stages of these diseases is a major unmet need. This review seeks to address this question by highlighting and discussing the central and peripheral systems through the collection of current data from clinical evidence and findings from experiments.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a tightly regulated process essential for central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, debris clearance, and defense against pathogens. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, are central to this response, supporting plasticity and repair under normal conditions. Following spinal cord injury (SCI), however, this response becomes amplified and dysregulated. Early microglial activation can be protective, but prolonged activation drives the release of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators that exacerbate secondary injury and hinder repair. Microglia also engage in complex crosstalk with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and infiltrating immune cells, orchestrating both protective and damaging processes. This dual and dynamic nature underscores their importance as both targets and modulators in SCI therapies. This review aims to examine the roles of microglia in SCI, summarizes SCI pathology, the specific roles of microglia and macrophages, and outlines translational efforts to modulate their activation, while also highlighting the barriers to clinical application. Evidence from preclinical studies and emerging therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological, cell-based, and exosome-based interventions, demonstrates the potential to reduce harmful inflammation, promote neuroprotection, and support functional recovery. Despite these advances, clinical translation remains limited, constrained by the heterogeneity of microglial responses, narrow therapeutic windows, and patient-specific variability. These challenges often lead to modest or inconsistent clinical outcomes. Future strategies will require precision, multi-targeted approaches that integrate microglial modulation with the preservation of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the regulation of peripheral immune infiltration. Harnessing the regenerative potential of microglia, guided by biomarker-based patient stratification and a deeper understanding of their dynamic roles, offers the most promising path toward meaningful recovery after SCI.">

In this issue of the JCI, Huang, Sati, and colleagues applied single-cell RNA-Seq and immunofluorescence to identify a subset of neutrophils in SS skin that display antigen-presenting cell–like (APC-like) features. The authors showed that when neutrophils interacted with keratinocytes, their lifespan was markedly extended, and they expressed MHC class II via activation of the serum amyloid A1/formyl peptide receptor 2 (SAA1/FPR2) signaling pathway. This, in turn, enabled T cell activation and sustained self-perpetuating inflammatory loops. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized keratinocyte-neutrophil circuit in SS and point to the SAA1/FPR2 axis as a potential target for more precise, mechanism-based therapy.">

        <tr id="Innate immune cells possess memory-like properties. Exposure to infections or sterile inflammation can prime them, leading to either exacerbated inflammatory responses, a process called trained immunity, or reduced responsiveness to pro-inflammatory signals, a process termed immune tolerance. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the central nervous system, are central players in neurodegenerative diseases. Characterizing trained immunity and tolerance in microglia is necessary for a better understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. Cell metabolic processes orchestrate microglia inflammatory responses and promote epigenetic changes shaping immune memory in microglia. Here, we review current knowledge on the role of cell metabolic pathways in microglia innate immune memory formation, focusing on glucose, glutamine, and lipid metabolism. Moreover, we address the significance of microglial immune memory in disease pathology and discuss the potential of therapeutic targeting of cell metabolic pathways in neurodegenerative disorders.">

        <tr id="In multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic compartmentalized inflammation is thought to drive relentless clinical deterioration. Here, we investigate the link between unresolved parenchymal inflammation and cellular senescence in MS progression. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human brain tissue reveals an accumulation of senescent-like glial cells in diseased white matter, especially in chronic active lesions, and to a lesser extent in the cortex. Spatial transcriptomics show gradients of senescence-like signatures extending from lesion cores to periplaque regions, alongside rewired cellular networks. Experimental induction of senescence in MS hiPSC-derived neural organoids demonstrates that microglia are especially vulnerable to inflammation-induced senescence, which can be partially rescued by CNS-penetrant anti-inflammatory drugs. At the patient level (n = 466), increased 3T MRI-estimated brain-age is observed, especially in individuals with more than four chronic active lesions. These findings suggest that chronic inflammation might accelerate senescence-like processes, potentially contributing to disease progression, and that its modulation might help limit further propagation.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by oligodendrocyte (OLG) degeneration, myelin loss, and impaired remyelination. Apolipoprotein D (Apo D), a glia-derived lipocalin, has emerged in recent decades as a neuroprotective molecule involved in lipid transport, oxidative stress regulation, and inflammation control during aging and neurodegenerative diseases like MS. However, its role in demyelination/remyelination dynamics remains poorly defined. In this study, we used the cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination model in C57BL/6 mice to analyze Apo D expression patterns in the corpus callosum during de- and remyelination. We also assessed whether the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (CLO), previously shown to upregulate Apo D in vivo, could modulate its expression and influence myelin recovery in this pathological context. Using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging, Luxol fast blue staining, and double immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that CPZ treatment for 3 or 6 weeks led to significant demyelination, hydrocephalus, and reduced motor cortex thickness, which were partially reversed after treatment cessation. Apo D expression in OLGs was significantly reduced by CPZ exposure, both at the protein level and in terms of immunoreactive cell counts, but was restored following treatment withdrawal. Notably, co-administration of CLO prevented the CPZ-induced reduction in Apo D expression in OLGs, although it did not attenuate myelin loss. In this way, our results reveal a strong correlation between Apo D expression and OLG/myelin integrity in vivo. While CLO did not exert remyelinating effects, it preserved Apo D levels under demyelinating conditions, suggesting a potential indirect neuroprotective mechanism. These findings support the relevance of Apo D in CNS myelin homeostasis and highlight its potential as a molecular target for therapeutic intervention in demyelinating diseases such as MS.">

        <tr id="Cell death pathways play contrasting roles in physiological processes such as responses to viral infections and vaccinations, potentially exerting either detrimental or beneficial effects. On one hand, uncontrolled cell death accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage. On the other hand, when properly regulated, these processes help establish an immunocompetent environment by activating innate immunity, which in turn stimulate antiviral immune responses. These mechanisms have emerged as promising targets for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics, immunotherapies, and vaccines. Recent advances have elucidated key aspects of cell death and DAMP pathways, highlighting their association with upstream viral sensors, their capacity to regulate immune responses, and their potential as therapeutic targets in the context of respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of cell death and DAMP pathways, focusing on their roles in antiviral immunity and pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, and vaccine immunogenicity.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Understanding the durability of immunity induced by mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, especially in individuals with chronic health conditions, remains essential for guiding booster strategies. We conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses up to 21 months after a primary two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination followed by a booster, either homologous (BNT162b2) or heterologous (mRNA-1273). Methods: Twenty-eight adults, mostly with chronic conditions, were assessed at approximately 9, 12 and 21 months post-primary vaccination. Serum anti-trimeric Spike IgG levels were quantified, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed at 21 months for Spike-specific memory B-cell and T-cell responses by flow cytometry. Results: Participants were stratified by booster type, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and health status. Anti-Spike IgG persisted in all participants but declined over time. The heterologous mRNA-1273 booster induced higher antibody titers at 9 months, while the homologous BNT162b2 booster led to more sustained antibody levels and higher frequencies of Spike-specific memory B cells at 21 months. Prior infection significantly enhanced antibody titers, particularly in homologous booster recipients. Surprisingly, individuals with chronic health conditions exhibited equal or higher antibody levels compared to healthy participants at all time points. At 21 months, robust Spike-specific class-switched memory B cells and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that BNT162b2 vaccination elicits durable, multi-layered immunity lasting nearly two years, even in individuals with chronic conditions, and support the use of both homologous and heterologous mRNA boosters to sustain protection in diverse populations.">

        <tr id="Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis share converging mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction, including protein aggregation, oxidative stress, and chronic neuroinflammation. Glial cells, once considered passive supporters, are now recognized as central drivers of these processes, offering both pathogenic triggers and therapeutic opportunities. Yet, despite compelling preclinical evidence, the translation of glial-targeted therapies into clinical success has been limited. This review provides a critical synthesis of current knowledge by examining therapeutic strategies through the lens of their translational challenges and failures. This narrative review highlights how interspecies variability of glial phenotypes, shifting neuroprotective versus neurotoxic states, limited biomarker stratification, and delivery barriers have constrained trials, such as anti-triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (anti-TREM2) antibodies in AD and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in PD. By analyzing these obstacles across major neurodegenerative disorders, this review argue that the next stage of glial medicine requires precision approaches that integrate stage-specific phenotyping, biomarker-guided patient selection, and innovative delivery platforms. Understanding not only what has been tried but why translation has stalled is essential to chart a roadmap for effective, disease-modifying glial therapies in the aging brain.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the critical need for broad-spectrum antivirals with high resistance barriers. Here, we demonstrate that SB431542, a selective TGF-β receptor I (ALK5) inhibitor, exhibits potent antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through unprecedented multitargeted mechanisms. Through comprehensive in vitro, isothermal titration calorimetry, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupts its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This interaction restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36–48 hours post-infection [hpi]), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-β-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release—processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 751.8 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favorable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-β/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-β-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection, collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for antiviral drugs with high barriers to resistance. This study reveals that SB431542, a drug previously developed to inhibit TGF-β signaling, exhibits remarkable effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 through an unprecedented triple-mechanism approach. Unlike conventional antivirals that target a single viral component, SB431542 simultaneously disrupts viral entry, assembly, and release by binding to the viral ORF3a protein and modulating host cellular processes. Most importantly, SARS-CoV-2 failed to develop resistance against SB431542 even after 50 generations of exposure—a significant advantage over current therapeutics that quickly lose effectiveness due to viral mutations. Our findings also uncover that coronaviruses exploit both lysosomal dysfunction and programmed cell death to spread efficiently, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. This research establishes SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor and demonstrates the value of targeting host-virus interactions to overcome antiviral resistance.">

Numerous studies have examined chemokine biomarkers in COVID-19 as a biomarker for high risk patients. The four main structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, spike protein, membrane protein, envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein enable the virus to penetrate host cells and stimulate the immune system. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via ACE2 in upper respiratory tract the virus entries by binding to the spike protein. Uncontrolled activation and enhancement of the immune response leads to massive release of cytokines and chemokines known as cytokine storm (CS). Chemokines are described as important cytokines in COVID-19 with a potential role as prognostic factor particularly for the severity of the infection and the risk of death from complications, to identify high-risk patients.

        <tr id="Lupus nephritis (LN), a serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), involves complex immune dysregulation that leads to chronic renal inflammation and progressive tissue damage. Despite decades of use of standard immunosuppressive therapy, treatment responses remain variable, and many patients experience relapses or develop end-stage renal disease. This review synthesizes emerging insights into the immunopathogenesis of LN, drawing on studies from single-cell transcriptomics, signaling pathway analyses and renal tissue immunology. It examines the role of both innate and adaptive immune cells in mediating disease. The therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving with novel biologics targeting B cell survival and cytokine signaling, small-molecule inhibitors modulating intracellular pathways, and promising developments in cell-based interventions. Notably, recent clinical case series have demonstrated that CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy can induce durable drug-free remission in LN, representing a transformative approach to immune modulation. These advances are further supported by the application of multi-omics platforms to refine biomarker-driven disease monitoring and personalized treatment. Integrating immunologic and technological innovations holds the potential to redefine therapeutic strategies in LN. Precision medicine approaches that leverage targeted therapies, immune resetting modalities, and biomarker-guided clinical decisions may significantly improve long-term renal outcomes and patient quality of life.">

Their role in viral infections is poorly understood, as their expression patterns during infection and the range of proteases they target have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we show widespread expression of human SERPINs in response to respiratory virus infections, both in bronchioalveolar lavages from COVID-19 patients and in polarized human airway epithelial cultures. Using in silico docking of 10 SERPINs to 48 host proteases, we confirm known targets and predict new interactions. Protease activity assays validated selected interactions, confirming the newly predicted host targets for PAI-1 (SERPINE1) and PAI-2 (SERPINB2). PAI-1 inhibits cathepsin L, essential for SARS-CoV-2 maturation, and suppresses multi-cycle replication of both ancestral SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 and its variant Omicron BA.1. In addition, we identify PAI-2 as an antiviral SERPIN that reduces infectivity of human adenovirus 5 by directly inhibiting the adenoviral protease. Our study leverages in silico docking using full-length 3D protein structures to uncover new SERPIN targets, offering a range of candidate targets for therapeutic interventions.">

Women are disproportionately affected by neuropsychiatric symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19. However, whether there are central nervous system-specific changes in gene expression in women with neuropsychiatric Long COVID (NP-Long COVID) remains unknown.


METHODS
Twenty-two women with and ten women without NP-Long COVID were enrolled from New Haven, CT, and the surrounding region and consented to a blood draw and large volume lumbar puncture. Total RNA was extracted from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Polyadenylated RNA was sequenced, and differential expression analyses were performed.


RESULTS
Both CSF and PBMC samples showed differential gene expression associated with Long COVID status. There were CSF-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in people with Long COVID, including in genes related to oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, and P53 response, indicating compartment-specific immune responses. Some pathways were dysregulated in both the CSF and PBMC of Long COVID compared to controls, including those related to androgen response, MTORC1 signaling, and lipid metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
Women with NP-long COVID show compartment-specific, transcriptional profiles in the CSF with evidence of enrichment in cellular stress pathways. These results underscore the importance of examining CSF-specific molecular profiles to better understand post-viral neurological syndromes.">

        <tr id="Smoldering inflammation and neurodegeneration, primarily driven by intraparenchymal immune cell activation and glial dysfunction, remains a major therapeutic challenge in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and contributes largely to disability progression. Current disease-modifying therapies effectively decrease relapse rate and, to a lesser extent, disease progression by targeting peripheral immune cells. However, they largely fail to address Central-Nervous-System-(CNS)-intrinsic pathological processes – especially glial dysfunction – thus leaving a critical gap relevant to disease progression and therapeutic intervention. In this context, neurotrophic factors (NTF) are secreted proteins central for development and maintenance of the CNS. They promote anti-inflammatory, protective phenotypes in astrocytes and microglia, support remyelination by enhancing oligodendrocyte precursor recruitment, maturation and survival, and exert direct neuroprotective effects. Exploring their role in MS offers a novel perspective on neuroimmune crosstalk and prevention of progressive neurodegeneration. In this article, we summarize relevant findings on NTFs in MS, and give an outlook on opportunities and challenges of using these mediators as next-generation disease-modifying therapies.">

Here, a comprehensive single-cell immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two independent cohorts of patients with MOGAD revealed pronounced immune perturbations in MOGAD when compared with healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis. Patients with MOGAD displayed an expansion of CXCR5-CD21- activated naïve and double-negative B cell subsets, a feature shared with patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition, we observed altered Fc gamma receptor expression in natural killer cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Within the T cell compartment, CXCR3+CD4+ memory T cells were reduced in the circulation of patients with MOGAD compared with healthy controls, and this result was mirrored in a transgenic mouse model that showed retention of these cells in the inflamed central nervous system.

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TRIM) is a form of long-lasting functional reprogramming of innate immune cells and their progenitors that enhances responsiveness to subsequent stimuli. Although first characterized in myeloid cells, TRIM was recently extended to nonmyeloid cell types, including endothelial and glial cells, which also exhibit stimulus-driven, memory-like behavior. While initially recognized as a protective mechanism, particularly in the context of vaccines and acute infections, TRIM can also become maladaptive, promoting chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and disease. This Review focuses on virus-induced TRIM while also addressing microbial, metabolic, and endogenous inducers. We examine key ligands and receptors that initiate TRIM and dissect the associated signaling and epigenetic pathways. Importantly, we argue that maladaptive TRIM arises not from a specific ligand, receptor, or molecular event, but from contextual factors such as stimulus persistence, dose, tissue microenvironment, and preexisting inflammation. The nature of the secondary challenge also shapes whether a trained response is adaptive or maladaptive. We further discuss TRIM induction in the bone marrow, involvement of both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells, and the role of lipid rafts in sustaining TRIM. We review maladaptive TRIM’s potential contribution to systemic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, sepsis, cancer, and autoimmunity, along with its influence on viral vaccine responses. Finally, we outline potential strategies to redirect maladaptive TRIM and propose key outstanding questions for future research.">

Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revealed that macrophages exist in a continuum of transcriptional states formed by tissue-specific and disorder-specific cues. This insight has led to the recognition of disorder-specific macrophages, defined as macrophage subpopulations that emerge in response to pathological stimuli and play unique roles in disease progression. These macrophages exhibit distinct transcriptional signatures, epigenetic modifications, and functional properties shaped by their ontogeny and microenvironmental signals, arising from the reprogramming of resident macrophages or the differentiation of bone marrow–derived progenitors. Notable examples include macrophages in chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis), immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, lipid-associated macrophages in obesity, and disease-associated microglia in neurodegeneration. These subsets exhibit unique regulatory mechanisms, including enhancer remodeling driven by histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, CCAAT enhancer binding protein α-mediated differentiation in obesity, and Jmjd3-IRF4 axis control in allergic inflammation. Additionally, their function and fate are strongly influenced by their subtissular niche, as evidenced by crown-like structures in adipose tissue, tumor microenvironments, fibrotic lesions, and granulomas, where distinct microenvironmental cues shape macrophage behavior. Furthermore, interindividual heterogeneity in macrophage function, driven by genetic polymorphisms, is increasingly recognized, highlighting the role of host genetic background in disease susceptibility and macrophage-driven pathology. Here, we review the conceptual evolution of the disorder-specific macrophage, tracing its origins from the limited M1/M2 model to its refinement through scRNA-seq-based classification. We summarize the ontogeny, transcriptional regulation, and spatial heterogeneity of these macrophages across various disorders, emphasizing how the subtissular niche dictates functional specialization. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting disorder-specific macrophage subsets, highlighting the need for integrative multi-omics approaches to refine their classification and functional characterization. Understanding the regulatory networks that govern disorder-specific macrophages will advance our knowledge of macrophage biology while facilitating the development of precision medicine for immune-related disorders.">

However, under certain conditions, this interaction becomes dysregulated, leading to thromboinflammation, a pathological process marked by the concurrent and excessive activation of coagulation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. During viral infections, this phenomenon can markedly worsen clinical outcomes. Evidence indicates that viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, influenza, and SARS-CoV can trigger thromboinflammatory responses involving platelet activation, the release of procoagulant and pro-inflammatory mediators, and the formation of thrombi within blood vessels. While this response may initially help contain viral dissemination, in cases of high viremia it can progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemorrhage, and multiple organ failure. This review compiles current evidence on thromboinflammatory mechanisms induced by arboviral and respiratory viruses and examines how these processes contribute to diseases’ pathogenesis and clinical severity.">

This paper analyzed the current literature related to long-term manifestations of COVID-19 and aimed to identify the common symptoms reported four weeks or more after the initial onset of the disease. COVID-19 has been shown to have lasting systemic effects on an array of organ systems, such as the lungs, heart, brain, and gastrointestinal systems. Common symptoms include, but are not limited to, fatigue, brain fog, respiratory difficulties, and loss of taste and smell. The impact of COVID-19 on multiple organ systems is thought to be associated with its ability to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors throughout the body and promote cytokine release. This study provides insight into common long-term manifestations of COVID-19. Future studies should look at how long COVID-19 syndrome affects various subpopulations differently.">

Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry at admission and at 50 days post-symptom onset (DPSO 50).Total T-cell counts normalized in 90–98% of patients in the moderate and severe groups by DPSO 50. Nevertheless, a subgroup exhibited persistent B-cell lymphopenia (<90 cells/µL) in 7.3% of moderate cases (median 77.1 cells/µL, IQR 51.9–83.8) and 12.5% of seltvere cases (median 54.5 cells/µL, IQR 28.4–79.3). Patients with B-cell deficiency also showed concurrent reductions in total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD4+CD25+CD127low/FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). In moderate cases, CD4+ T cell and Treg counts correlated positively (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), independent of B-cell status, whereas this relationship was absent in severe cases, indicating severity-dependent immune dysregulation.Approximately 7–12% of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 survivors displayed persistent lymphopenia affecting B cells, CD4+ T cells, and Tregs at ~50 days post-symptom onset. These findings highlight distinct recovery trajectories and provide insights into Long COVID pathogenesis that may inform therapeutic strategies.">

We discuss the central role of microglia in the neuroinflammatory cascade, their polarization between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes, and how this process influences neuronal damage and tissue repair. This review highlights the roles of the complement system, inflammasome activation, and blood–brain barrier disruption as key drivers of inflammation and neuronal injury. Additionally, we elaborate on the dynamic interactions between resident and infiltrating immune cells, which amplify inflammation and impede post-ischemic recovery.

        <tr id="Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting motor neurons, but immune dysfunction may contribute to disease progression and treatment response. While AAV9-delivered SMN1 gene therapy (e.g., Zolgensma) improves survival, long-term motor outcomes remain variable. This study integrates bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define immune dysregulation in SMA. We analyzed peripheral blood from infants with SMA (n = 7 for bulk RNA-seq; n = 4 for scRNA-seq, <25 mo of age) along with age-matched healthy controls (n = 4 for bulk RNA-seq; n = 6 for scRNA-seq). We profiled differentially expressed genes, immune pathways, cell-cell interactions, and gene regulatory networks. SMA samples showed distinct transcriptomic signatures and elevated immune activation compared to controls. NECTIN1 was identified as a transcriptomic biomarker of disease progression, while HSPA7 was validated from prior reports. A 6- to 7-mo inflection point marked a transition from metabolic regulation to immune activation in SMA infants. NF-κB-related inflammatory gene expression was significantly elevated post-gene therapy relative to both pretreatment and healthy controls, with IL1B and RNF19B emerging as key transcriptomic mediators. scRNA-seq revealed early dysfunction and G1-phase arrest in CD4+ T-cells, along with a switch to RELB-mediated noncanonical NF-κB signaling. In symptomatic infants, CD8+ T-cells showed higher proliferation and exhaustion, with co-upregulation of TBX21 and EOMES, genes consistent with chronic stimulation and a trajectory toward terminal differentiation. Immune dysregulation is a central feature of SMA and may influence treatment response. These findings support future development of adjunct immunomodulatory strategies to enhance gene therapy efficacy and suggest that immune signatures may correlate with motor function outcomes.">

        <tr id="Mounting evidence supports a critical role for central nervous system (CNS) glial cells in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), as well as neurovascular ischemic stroke. Previously, we found that loss of the PD-associated gene leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (Lrrk2) in macrophages, peripheral innate immune cells, induced mitochondrial stress and elevated basal expression of type I interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) due to chronic mitochondrial DNA engagement with the cGAS/STING DNA sensing pathway. Here we report that loss of LRRK2 results in a paradoxical response in microglial cells, a CNS-specific macrophage population. In primary murine microglia and microglial cell lines, loss of Lrrk2 reduces tonic IFN signaling leading to a reduction in ISG expression. Consistent with reduced type I IFN, mitochondria from Lrrk2 KO microglia are protected from stress and have elevated metabolism. These protective phenotypes involve upregulation of NRF2, an important transcription factor in the response to oxidative stress and are restricted by LRRK2 kinase activity. Collectively, these findings illustrate a dichotomous role for LRRK2 within different immune cell populations and give insight into the fundamental differences between immune regulation in the CNS and the periphery.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, cause severe infections of the respiratory system. Cohort studies and clinical observations indicate that patients with severe influenza A virus (IAV) infections are at an increased risk of developing an ischemic stroke event. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To this end, we investigated the consequences of IAV infection on cerebral damage in a mouse model of ischemic stroke.


METHODS
We intranasally inoculated male C57BL6/N mice with the mouse-adapted IAV strain A/Puerto Rico 8/34 or PBS as a vehicle control. At 3, 7, and 10 days post-infection, mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by sacrifice 24 hours after reperfusion for subsequent analysis. The anticoagulant drug acetylsalicylic acid was administered as treatment 1 day before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.


RESULTS
Our research demonstrated a time-dependent deterioration of cerebral ischemia after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, resulting in increased infarct volume and a worsened neurological outcome at the propagation and inflammation phases of infection. Our observations revealed an elevation in procoagulant activity and an increase in thrombosis within the microvasculature after infection and stroke. This effect was attributed to an infection-mediated inflammatory milieu and accelerated neutrophil response. Upon infection, the release of increased neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils had detrimental consequences for transient middle cerebral artery occlusion development. Administration of acetylsalicylic acid or control antiviral therapy prevented the IAV-induced exacerbation of stroke and reduced brain damage by reducing NETosis and coagulation.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that IAV infections enhance the systemic propensity for NETosis and foster a procoagulant state, thereby increasing the risk of cerebral damage and thrombosis following stroke. Targeting a combination of neutrophils and coagulation molecules simultaneously represents a promising treatment approach for clinical stroke.">

        <tr id="Highlights What are the main findings? Auranofin suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation and attenuates the IL-33/ST2–CXCL1 axis, thereby reducing neutrophil recruitment in MSU-based models. Prophylactic dosing mitigates paw and air-pouch inflammation; enforced IL-33 overexpression abrogates these effects, indicating pathway dependency. What is the implication of the main finding? Redox/thioredoxin-reductase targeting offers a dual-action strategy complementary to selective NLRP3 and CXCR2 blockade. The results motivate on-flare dosing and combination regimens (e.g., IL-33/ST2 or CXCR2 inhibition) under clinically aligned, exposure-matched designs. Abstract Gout is a form of sterile inflammatory arthritis in which monosodium urate (MSU) crystals deposit and provoke a neutrophil-predominant response, primarily driven by activation of the NACHT, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Here, we show that auranofin, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-rheumatic agent, exerts anti-inflammatory effects in both in vitro and in vivo models of gout. Auranofin inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human THP-1 cells and murine macrophages, leading to reduced cleavage of caspase-1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-18 (IL-18). In MSU crystal-induced mouse models, auranofin treatment reduced paw swelling, serum cytokine levels, and tissue inflammation. Notably, auranofin suppressed neutrophil migration and decreased expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) in inflamed foot tissue and air-pouch exudates. Mechanistically, auranofin disrupted the interleukin-33 (IL-33)/suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) axis, a key signaling pathway promoting neutrophil recruitment. Overexpression of IL-33 abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of auranofin, highlighting the central role of IL-33 in gout pathogenesis. Together, our findings suggest that auranofin alleviates MSU-induced inflammation by concurrently inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-33-mediated neutrophil recruitment, supporting its potential as a dual-action therapeutic candidate for gout.">

        <tr id="Background
Despite widespread vaccination efforts against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, variants with increased transmissibility or immune evasion continue to emerge, posing a considerable challenge. Understanding the immunological factors associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) progression is essential for improving patient management and treatment strategies. We explored the dynamic changes in the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) profile, including T lymphocyte subsets, to assess their potential as predictors of disease severity and progression.


Methods
Two hundred fifty-eight patients hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 were classified into four sub-cohorts based on changes in disease severity over 7 days. WBC parameters, including absolute neutrophil, total lymphocyte, and T cell subset counts, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were assessed at admission and after 7 days.


Results
Patients with persistent mild-to-moderate illness exhibited a marked increase in the lymphocyte count and a decrease in the NLR over time. In contrast, patients with sustained severe-to-critical illness showed an increasing WBC count without a corresponding increase in the lymphocyte count, in addition to a marked elevation in the NLR. Patients whose condition improved from severe-to-critical to mild-to-moderate illness showed increased cluster of differentiation (CD)3+ and CD4+ T cell counts and an elevated CD4/CD8 ratio, whereas the NLR did not significantly change.


Conclusions
The early-phase dynamics of T cell subsets may serve as a useful biomarker of disease severity and recovery in patients with COVID-19. Monitoring these immunological changes may help support clinical decision-making and inform the timing of therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract The obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii is estimated to infect a third of the world’s population. Toxoplasmosis is considered a significant worldwide disease that can lead to morbidity or death in immunocompromised individuals. Host defense against T. gondii has been demonstrated to be dependent on a rapid myeloid cell and lymphocyte response working in concert to quickly eliminate the invading pathogen. Classically, T-bet–dependent group 1 innate lymphocytes (ILC1s), natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+ T cell–derived interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are considered indispensable for host resistance against T. gondii. However, recent discoveries have illustrated that T-bet is not required for NK cell– or CD4+ T cell–derived IFN-γ. Yet, lack of T-bet still results in rapid mortality, pointing to a T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–mediated host defense pathway. This review summarizes the myeloid cell–mediated immune response against T. gondii and provides insights into the lesser known components of the T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–dependent host defense pathway for pathogen clearance.">

        <tr id="Sepsis remains a global health problem that causes millions of deaths each year. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is highly desired to allow a rapid use of appropriate antibiotics. A better understanding of the associated pathophysiology has been achieved these recent years. The initial appropriate immune response to infection evolves towards an overwhelmed inflammatory response involving both pro- and anti-inflammatory players that act concomitantly. It also includes cell deaths and cellular dysfunctions of leukocytes, endothelial cells and epithelial cells, associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. These dysregulations are responsible for organ impairment and alteration of immune status of circulating leukocytes. In contrast, within the tissues, an over-activation exists as illustrated by transcriptomic analyses of organs of patients deceased of sepsis, and revealed by the presence of a macrophage activation syndrome within the bone marrow. Despite progresses in understanding the mechanisms underlying sepsis and despite successful therapies in animal models, no real new therapies have emerged these recent decades. This failure may reflect the yin yang aspect of the same players of the host response such as fever, release of cytokines, or coagulation which can display both a beneficial or a detrimental role. Great hopes are now expected from precision medicine, based on patients' endotypes which should help to decipher the patient's sub-groups who could benefit from the different treatments, or to define some appropriate time windows for a given treatment.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in global morbidity and high mortality rates worldwide. According to case histories, for a long time after acute COVID-19 infection (six months to 2-3 years), patients may experience a pronounced fatigue, increased tiredness, higher incidence of acute respiratory viral infections per year, increased recurrence of skin diseases, allergies, exacerbation of pulmonary disorders, urinary tract diseases, increased recurrence of chronic viral diseases, e.g., herpesvirus and papillomavirus infections, aggravation of chronic cardiovascular and other somatic diseases of various organs and systems. Patients were examined at early as six months after recovery from acute COVID-19. Such persistent post-infectious consequences are referred to as post-COVID syndrome. When assessing post-COVID syndrome, it is necessary to identify the main clinical syndromes of multiorgan pathology characteristic of post-COVID patients. Endocrine and cardiac manifestations of post-COVID syndrome may be a consequence of direct damage from viral infection, immunological and inflammatory damage, as well as iatrogenic complications. Objective of our study was to assess the impact of acute COVID-19 severity on the course of post-COVID syndrome. The research objectives were as follows: 1. To analyze the severity of clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disorders in post-COVID patients depending on the degree of lung damage in the acute period of COVID-19 (CT0 to CT4). 2. To analyze the severity of clinical manifestations of endocrine disorders, including newly diagnosed pathology, in post-COVID patients depending on the degree of lung damage in acute period of COVID-19. Since we did not found any significant gender-and age-dependent differences, all patients were divided into groups by the degree of lung damage during acute period of COVID-19, according to clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection. This study showed that the clinical picture of post-COVID syndrome is characterized by a pronounced diversity in development of multiple organ pathology, both newly diagnosed, or manifesting by increased frequency of exacerbations of chronic diseases. Conclusions: 1. According to the data obtained, reliable differences were obtained between groups CT0 and CT1-2, as well as CT0 and CT3-4: the frequency of exacerbating cardiovascular disorders in the post-COVID period is significantly higher in groups with lung damage over acute period of COVID-19 compared to the group of patients without lung damage. These data suggest that cardiovascular disorders are directly related to the severity of COVID-19, viral load, and were detected most frequently (68%) in post-COVID patients who initially had a severe coronavirus infection. 2. According to our results, the frequency of glucose metabolism disorders, including those detected for the first time, proved to be significantly increased in the post-COVID patients with lung damage during acute infection. Meanwhile, no significant differences were found for thyroid disorders, except of autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). These disorders may be associated with usage of corticosteroid therapy in acute period of coronavirus infection, or with impairment of regulatory mechanisms of the endocrine and immune systems induced by SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus again confirming our assumptions concerning development of multiple organ pathology in post-COVID patients.">

        <tr id="In the face of severe outcomes from COVID-19, vaccines have proven immunogenic and safe and are strongly recommended during pregnancy. This study examines the effects of maternal COVID-19 vaccination on physical development, behavior, and neurogenesis in mouse offspring. After inoculation with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero Cell) at gestational day 14.5, antibodies were detected in the serum of dams and pups. At one month of age, offspring of vaccinated dams—but not controls—showed enhanced working memory, increased neural proliferation, neuroblast formation, stem cell activity, and more mature neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG). Luminex assay showed elevated hippocampal IFN-γ and CX3CL1, both linked to neurogenesis and memory. Conditional knockout experiments identified microglial IFNγR1 and CX3CR1 as key mediators of neuronal development through regulating microglial activation and chemotaxis. These findings suggest maternal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination transiently enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and working memory in offspring, without causing neurodevelopmental risk.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a critical factor contributing to secondary brain injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This process engages diverse cell types within the central nervous system (CNS), including significant infiltration of myeloid lineage cells–primarily neutrophils and macrophages–during the acute and subacute phases of TBI. These myeloid-derived cells represent a major population that critically influences the development and progression of neuroinflammation. Microglia and peripherally infiltrating macrophages exhibit polarization phenotypes that play a pivotal role in modulating inflammatory changes. Due to their functional and phenotypic similarities, their distinct contributions to the inflammatory response in TBI remain a subject of considerable debate. Lysozyme 2 (Lyz2) is a well-established marker for myeloid lineage cells (including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) in mice, allowing specific targeting and depletion of these cells to dissect their functional roles in TBI.In the present study, we investigated the trend of inflammatory factors during the early stage of TBI using Lyz2-IRES-DTREGFP transgenic mice, which specifically target and deplete Lyz2-positive myeloid cells. Tissue samples for RT-qPCR and flow cytometry were harvested from the perilesional cortex (within a 2-mm radius of the impact site) and the underlying hippocampus.Our findings revealed a considerable reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-1β, iNOS, IL-6, IFN-γ) and an increase in the expression of anti-inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, Arg-1). Furthermore, we observed a shift in polarization phenotypes, characterized by a decreased proportion of M1 macrophages and an increased proportion of M2 macrophages. However, during the chronic phase, behavioral and histological analyses revealed worse outcomes. These findings demonstrate that targeted depletion of Lyz2-positive myeloid cells during acute TBI attenuates neuroinflammation. However, this early immunomodulatory shift correlates paradoxically with exacerbated chronic neurological deficits, suggesting that transient suppression of myeloid-driven inflammation may disrupt long-term reparative processes critical for functional recovery after TBI.">

        <tr id="Pidotimod, a synthetic dipeptide, has been utilized for over three decades as an immunomodulatory agent to prevent recurrent respiratory infections, particularly in immunocompromised populations such as children and the elderly. Originally developed for its ability to enhance innate and adaptive immune responses, pidotimod is now being revisited in light of new clinical insights and emerging therapeutic needs. Recent studies have expanded its potential beyond traditional indications, with evidence supporting its role in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis, and even viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Pidotimod exerts its effects by stimulating dendritic cells, enhancing toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, and promoting cytokine production, including IL-2 and IFN-γ, thereby supporting both cellular and humoral immunity. This broad-spectrum immune modulation makes pidotimod a promising adjunct in managing immune-mediated diseases and infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. In this review, we examine pidotimod’s pharmacodynamics, summarize clinical evidence from recent studies, and explore its evolving role in modern therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases. Given its safety profile and oral administration, pidotimod holds significant promise not only for preventing infections but also as part of a broader immunomodulatory approach in complex disease management.">

COVID-19, or the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, affects glucose metabolism to a great extent. Recent studies have reported that hyperglycemia and glucose control disorders among patients with COVID-19 can increase the severity of infection, mainly in individuals with prior chronic non-fatal conditions including diabetes. The aim of this study is to assess some glucose biomarkers as Random Blood Sugar and Fructosamine levels that might be useful in COVID-19 patients during acute phase of infection and recovery. This study included 150 participants: 100 COVID-19 patients (50 males, 50 females) and 50 controls in Baghdad from November 2021 to June 2022. Blood samples were collected during the acute (1-3 weeks) and recovery phases (4-6 weeks) of infection. Random Blood Sugar, Glycated Hemoglobin, and Fructosamine levels were measured using a fully automated biochemical analyzer (INTEGRA-400 plus by Roche). The significant sex differences in glucose biomarkers in acute and recovery phases of COVID-19 patients were shown by this study. In the acute phase, Random blood sugar (RBS) levels were significantly more elevated in males to 382.98 ± 160.37 mg/dl compared with females 207.96 ± 65.38 mg/dl while similar trends were seen in HbA1c and fructosamine level respectively.) During recovery phase high glucose levels persist in males as well which clearly indicate the stronger effect of COVID-19 on glucose metabolism might be more in males. These results highlight the need to follow the glucose profiles in individuals with COIVID-19, and especially in men. The study reveals that COVID-19 patients often experience compromised glucose regulation, particularly in males. Compared to females, males have higher blood RBS, HbA1c, and fructosamine levels, making them more susceptible to high blood glucose levels. Post-recovery, glucose profiles remain elevated, especially in males, making them more susceptible to diabetes and other metabolic complications. Fructosamine is more useful as a follow-up indicator.

        <tr id="Introduction During the acute-phase of COVID-19, elevated levels of several acute-phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), mannose-binding lectin (MBL), pentraxin 3 (PTX-3), serum amyloid A (SAA) and surfactant protein D (SP-D), are associated with severe to fatal clinical outcomes. Typically, these markers return to baseline within days after resolution of the acute infection. Methods In this study, we assessed the plasma levels of these proteins in a well-defined cohort of 141 COVID-19 convalescent patients 10 weeks after infection and compared them to 98 non-infected controls. In addition, we performed genetic analyses in a subgroup of patients and related the findings with structural equation modelling to disease severity. Results In contrast to other acute-phase proteins, PTX-3 levels were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 convalescent patients than in the control group. Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited PTX-3 levels above 5000 pg/ml even 10 months post-infection, compared to those with mild disease. To explore potential genetic influences, a genetic analysis was performed on all severely affected patients (n=36) and on an age- and sex-matched subset of mild COVID-19 patients (n=38). Results revealed a significantly higher frequency (p<0.0001) of the homozygous wildtype genotype of the PTX-3 SNP rs971145291 in severe (15 out of 36) versus mild (1 out of 38) COVID-19 patients. Using structural equation modelling, the association of this PTX-3 genotype and disease severity was shown to be mediated by elevated PTX-3 levels, with no contribution from other analyzed (clinical) confounders. Discussion In summary, severe COVID-19 patients show high PTX-3 serum levels which may be influenced by genetic predisposition, specifically the absence of the rs971145291 SNP variant. PTX-3 may thus serve both as a biomarker for tissue damage and/or long-term immune activation and eventually post-COVID-19 complications.">

        <tr id="Current research findings suggest that dysregulation between the nervous and immune systems is a primary factor contributing to both initiation and progression of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Microglia consists of resident brain immune cells playing a pivotal role in neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity impairment. However, understanding these mechanisms has been limited by the lack of relevant experimental models. One promising approach involves microglia-like cells derived from peripheral blood monocytes (MDMi), which can serve as an effective model for studying human microglial function and developing personalized therapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric diseases. The aim of our study was to optimize a protocol for generating sufficient quantities of microglia-like cells from peripheral blood monocytes of children with autism suitable for functional testing. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 18 children diagnosed with autism (mean age: 8.2 years; range: 6-12 years; 12 boys, 6 girls). Mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. After a 24-hour incubation period, adherent fractions enriched in monocytes were obtained via plate adherence. The monocytes were then cultured for either 10 or 14 days in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with antibiotics and various cytokine cocktails to induce differentiation into MDMi. Viability was assessed using supravital staining with DAPI, while phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry targeting specific microglial markers such as P2RY12 and TMEM119. Statistical analyses were performed using PAST software version 4.03. Our findings demonstrate that successful induction of microglia-like cells requires, at least, a ten-day culture period with 3 × 105 cells per well in RPMI-1640 medium containing stable glutamine, antibiotics, and a cocktail of three cytokines: GM-CSF, 10 ng/mL; IL-34, 100 ng/mL; IL-3, 10 ng/mL. Under these conditions, approximately 6 × 104 viable cells are generated, with over 90% expressing the microglial marker P2RY12. This cell population provides a valuable tool for studying ASD pathogenesis and identifying personalized treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="Immune dysregulation is one of the main causes of severe coronavirus infection COVID-19. The immune response in COVID-19 is characterized by the activation of innate immune cells and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukins-1, -6, -8), neutrophils, C-reactive protein and ferritin. Organ dysfunction, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, is associated with cytokine storm. Another important sign of immune dysregulation is lymphopenia, one of the key predictor of the development of severe COVID-19 and poor outcome. One of the main causes of lymphopenia in patients with severe COVID-19 is apoptosis of lymphocytes. The increased proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the induction of lymphocytes apoptosis and lymphopenia. The clinical role of lymphocytes apoptosis in COVID-19 is associated with the immunosupression and the opportunistic and secondary infectious diseases. The immunosupression in severe COVID-19 is confirmed by the results of morphological studies demonstrating the depletion of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue. Next important cause of lymphopenia is lymphocyte sequestration in the lungs. Postmortem studies of the lungs of patients died from COVID-19 show the lymphocytic infiltration. Additionally, lymphopenia may result from impaired lymphopoiesis due to virus-induced damage to lymphocyte precursors in the bone marrow and thymus. In COVID-19 patients, there is a significant reduction in the production of T-cells in the thymus. The decreased thymic function may exacerbate lymphopenia in patients during the acute phase of COVID-19 and prolong the time required for the recovery of circulating T-cell counts.">

        <tr id="Abstract Nowadays, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), featuring clinical manifestation of fever with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and multiple organ function impairment, has been paid more and more attention. It has become the pandemic for a few years and a quantity of people died of it. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection may lead to the development of SFTS, which is characterized by decreased counts of lymphocyte subsets, especially T cells, B cells and natural killer cells, and disruptive release of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. However, the deeper mechanism of this disease remains unidentified. To excavate the mechanisms of lymphopenia in SFTSV infection and to introduce the potential therapeutics, this paper focuses on lymphopenia as well as reviews the mechanisms and effects of lymphopenia caused by SFTSV infection, mainly through making analogies with other similar viruses to explain the details of programmed cell death. Other factors such as IL-6,IL-10, TNF-α and some vital immunocytes also play significant roles in eliciting lymphopenia. Eventually, the probable clinical implications have been discussed, mentioning that lymphopenia induced by multiple pathways in SFTSV infection may be associated with the severity of viral disease and opportunistic infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract The role of type I interferon (IFN) in mediating tumor immunosurveillance, in situ vaccination, and response to other cancer immunotherapies is well established. The biologic and species-specific differences between type I IFN family members have not been sufficiently addressed. Recombinant IFN-α2 has been approved for the treatment of chronic viral infections (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus) and some forms of cancer. IFN-β was approved to treat patients with multiple sclerosis but failed in the treatment of chronic viral infections or cancer. These distinct therapeutic applications most likely reflect distinct biologic roles of the individual IFNs that unfortunately remain poorly understood. IFN-β can be secreted by essentially all nucleated cells activated through most pattern recognition receptors (PRR). By contrast, IFN-α is predominantly secreted by the P1 subset of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which mediate viral defense and successful cancer immunotherapy following their activation by toll-like receptor (TLR)7 or TLR9 agonists. The biologic effects of TLR7 and TLR9 agonists depend critically on their structure and their ability to be processed by endosomal nucleases into fragments capable of binding two distinct agonist binding sites. The clinical activity of TLR7 and TLR9 agonists in cancer immunotherapy is associated with their induction of IFN-α secretion and P1 pDC differentiation. CD8+ T cells likely evolved for the primary purpose of killing viral/retroviral-infected cells. Immune cells detect viral/retroviral infected cells using TLR7 and TLR8 to distinguish viral GU-nucleotide-rich RNA from self-RNA modified with pseudouridine, and TLR9 to distinguish viral unmethylated CpG DNA from self-DNA modified with 5-methylcytosine. Recent studies have defined antagonist pockets in TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 that bind degradation products of endogenous modified RNA and DNA to inhibit responses to host nucleic acids. These findings point to a role for TLR7/8/9 acting cooperatively to enable innate immunity to distinguish retroviral particles from apoptotic blebs, with important implications for optimising in situ vaccination and other cancer immunotherapy strategies, and treating systemic autoimmune diseases mediated by the inappropriate activation of TLR7/8/9 by apoptotic debris.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the cause of the global pandemic of 2019–2023. Despite the fact that COVID-19 primarily affects the lung tissue, cardiovascular complications are not uncommon both at the height of the disease, and in the post-COVID period. The presence of previous cardiovascular diseases and advanced age of the patient are proven risk factors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. 
AIM: Based on the analysis of the current literature sources, to determine the role of mast cell proteases in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. 
Excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by mast cells in the new coronavirus infection conditions the initiation of a severe systemic inflammatory response that affects not only the lung tissue, but also the myocardium. One most significant mechanism of the development of cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19 is endothelial dysfunction of the microcirculatory system with the formation of ischemic areas with subsequent local apoptosis of cardiac myocytes. 
CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 develop primarily due to the damaging effect of proinflammatory cytokines, the production of which is stimulated by proteases of activated mast cells. Because of small amount of published data, additional investigation is required.">

        <tr id="Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus affecting 10–20 million people worldwide. While many carriers remain asymptomatic, HTLV-1 infection can trigger intense inflammatory responses which are defined by the sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Central to this process is the HTLV-1 encoded Tax oncoprotein, a viral regulator that drives uncontrolled inflammation by hijacking multiple cellular signaling pathways, such as the RelA/NF-κB signal transduction pathway. CD4 T-cells are the primary targets of Tax-mediated transformation, undergoing uncontrolled proliferation and significantly contributing to chronic immune activation seen in HTLV-1-associated diseases. However, highly activated CD4 T-cells are not alone in fueling this inflammatory “wildfire.” Other immune cells, including CD8 T-cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, also play critical roles in exacerbating the inflammatory milieu. These cells, in conjunction with CD4 T-cells, release a barrage of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α/β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-α/β, and IFN-γ) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α/β, RANTES, MCP-3, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), all of which are perpetuating the cycle of immune activation and tissue damage. This hyper stimulated immune response contributes to HTLV-1 replication/dissemination and can lead to the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM-TSP). Despite existing treatments aimed at controlling viral replication, the persistent inflammation in HTLV-1-infected individuals even in asymptomatic carriers (ACs) remains a major challenge, suggesting that targeting these pro-inflammatory responses may be another mandatory therapeutic strategy. In this context, this short-review focuses on the key immune responses that drive HTLV-1-associated inflammation and explores how these high pro-inflammatory responses contribute to the development of HTLV-1-related complications, including HAM-TSP, ATLL, and other associated inflammatory diseases during chronic viral infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) remains a major cause of global mortality, yet natural immunity prevents disease in more than 90% of exposed individuals. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is a critical regulator of innate immunity and enhances macrophage antimicrobial responses. Methods Using in vitro systems approaches, we compared the effects of IFN-γ exposure before versus after infection. We manipulated c-Myc in primary macrophages with a tetracycline-inducible lentiviral system. c-Myc expression was also analyzed in tissues from murine tuberculosis models and human granulomas. Results Preinfection IFN-γ exposure primed macrophages for enhanced bacterial control, whereas postinfection exposure did not. We identified c-Myc signaling as a central determinant of macrophage antimycobacterial function. Inhibition of c-Myc via Omomyc enhanced bacterial control partly through mTORC1-dependent metabolic reprogramming and nitric oxide production. In vivo analyses, including murine models and human clinical histopathology, revealed strong associations between c-Myc expression, MTB persistence, and active tuberculosis. Conclusion c-Myc mediates immune privilege in MTB infection and represents a promising target for host-directed therapies to enhance macrophage function.">

        <tr id="We hypothesize that specific macrophage differentiation trajectories in heart failure (HF) are coupled with subtype-specific and context-dependent engagement of programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, particularly ferroptosis and anoikis, which in turn influence disease progression and remodeling. HF is a progressive and heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterized by adverse immune remodeling, yet the precise contributions of macrophage heterogeneity, lineage dynamics, and PCD programs to its pathogenesis remain unclear. This study aimed to delineate, at single-cell resolution, the cellular and molecular landscape of cardiac macrophage subpopulations and their engagement with immunogenic cell death programs.We profiled human cardiac tissues from HF and non-failing donors using scRNA-seq from the SCP1303 dataset, initially comprising ~600,000 cells and reduced to ~120,000 high-quality cells from 18 samples after stringent quality control to retain biologically valid but metabolically distinct populations. Standardized cell-type annotation and pseudotime trajectory reconstruction were applied. Pathway activity was quantified using AUCell (primary) and GSVA (complementary) for cell death–related signatures. Integrated differential expression analysis, protein–protein interaction network mapping, and multi-algorithm feature selection (LASSO, SVM-RFE, Random Forest) were performed, and candidate biomarkers were validated using an independent bulk RNA-seq dataset (GSE57345).Thirteen major cardiac cell types were identified, with macrophages showing the highest transcriptional heterogeneity. We resolved four macrophage subtypes and mapped bifurcating disease-associated differentiation trajectories, revealing distinct activation patterns of ferroptosis- and anoikis-related pathways. Ferroptosis-associated genes and anoikis-associated genes displayed subtype-specific enrichment and significant differential activation in HF. Pseudotime analysis demonstrated that suppression of ferroptosis and anoikis was linked to late-stage, HF-enriched macrophage states. Key biomarkers—including CD163, FPR1, and VSIG4—achieved robust diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.80) in discriminating HF phenotypes.This is the first study to integrate scRNA-seq, differentiation trajectory inference, and PCD pathway scoring to define the context-dependent engagement of ferroptosis and anoikis in macrophage subtypes in HF. The identification of subtype-specific biomarkers and functional states provides novel mechanistic insight and potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets, underscoring the value of high-resolution immune profiling for precision immunology in cardiovascular disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Sepsis remains a major clinical challenge, often resulting in long‐term physiological and immunological disturbances. This study employed high‐throughput single‐cell Raman spectroscopy to analyze the biochemical profiles of peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with non‐COVID‐19 and COVID‐19‐associated sepsis. Leukocytes were assessed at multiple timepoints, including the acute phase (Days 3 and 7 after sepsis onset) and late recovery phase (6 and 12 months after sepsis onset). Raman spectroscopic profiles of leukocytes showed clear separation between healthy controls and sepsis patients during the acute phase with high balanced accuracy (BAcc: 95%–98%). Spectral differences between acute and recovery phases (BAcc: 84%–97%) and between recovery‐phase leukocytes and those from healthy controls (BAcc: 81%–90%) were also observed, indicating long‐lasting molecular alterations. Furthermore, distinct profiles were identified between non‐COVID‐19 and COVID‐19‐associated sepsis during the acute phase (BAcc: 65%–71%) and in the late‐recovery phase (BAcc: 71%–83%). These findings demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy enables label‐free, high‐throughput profiling of leukocyte biochemistry across the sepsis trajectory. This suggests that Raman spectroscopy is a promising tool for high‐throughput screening, offering insights into the biomolecular changes in sepsis and providing a diagnostic platform to differentiate between sepsis etiologies, a significant advancement in the field of sepsis diagnostics.">

        <tr id="Microglia and macrophages are critical immune cells within the central nervous system (CNS), with distinct roles in development, homeostasis, and disease. Once viewed as passive bystanders, these cells are now recognized for their dynamic phenotypic plasticity, which enables them to respond to a wide range of physiological and pathological stimuli. During homeostasis, microglia and CNS-resident macrophages actively participate in synaptic pruning, neuronal support, myelin regulation, and immune surveillance, contributing to CNS integrity. However, under pathological conditions, these cells can adopt neurotoxic phenotypes, exacerbating neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma. This review synthesizes emerging insights into the molecular, epigenetic, and metabolic mechanisms that govern the behavior of microglia and macrophages, highlighting their developmental origins, niche-specific programming, and interactions with other CNS cells. We also explore novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating these immune cells to restore CNS homeostasis, including nanotechnology-based approaches for selective targeting, reprogramming, and imaging. Understanding the complex roles of microglia and macrophages in both health and disease is crucial for the development of precise therapies targeting neuroimmune interfaces.

        <tr id="SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted long-term health concerns of viral pneumonia, yet its potential impact on cancer development and growth remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus promoted lung tumor progression by reprogramming the local immune landscape. Retrospective clinical analysis revealed that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 exhibited increased lung cancer incidence. Using multiple murine lung cancer models, we show that prior severe respiratory viral infections accelerated tumor growth and reduced survival. Mechanistically, prior viral pneumonia epigenetically remodeled the lung to establish a pro-tumor microenvironment, including the local accumulation of SiglecFhi tumor-associated neutrophils, a transcriptionally reprogrammed, immunosuppressive population whose signature predicted poor prognosis in human lung adenocarcinoma. In parallel, epithelial compartments exhibited altered differentiation trajectories, with persistence of injury-associated alveolar intermediates positioned along tumorigenic lineages. We observe sustained chromatin remodeling at key cytokine loci in immune and structure cells, linking inflammatory memory to persistent immune suppression. Therapeutically, combined inhibition of neutrophil recruitment via CXCR2 and PD-L1 signaling restored CD8+ T cell infiltration and suppressed tumor growth. Together, our findings establish a direct causal relationship between viral pneumonia, including COVID-19, and lung tumorigenesis, highlighting the urgent need to monitor survivors for elevated cancer risk and to develop targeted interventions and therapies aimed at preventing potential cancer bursts in COVID-19 convalescents.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play pivotal roles in the onset and progression of various neurological disorders. Owing to their remarkable plasticity, microglia can adopt diverse phenotypic states in response to distinct microenvironmental cues. Over the past decades, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that immune cell metabolism critically regulates their polarization and effector functions through a process termed metabolic reprogramming, in which glucose metabolism is particularly central. Glycolytic reprogramming underlies the entire polarization process, and elucidating its mechanisms may enable targeted modulation of microglial activity to mitigate their deleterious effects in CNS pathologies, thereby offering novel therapeutic avenues for these diseases.This paper summarizes what is known about microglial polarization and glycolytic reprogramming and explores their important roles in the development of neurological diseases. The link between microglial metabolomics and epigenetics in neurological disorders requires further study.Microglia exhibit distinct phenotypic states at different stages of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and these polarization processes are closely coupled with glucose metabolic reprogramming. Proinflammatory microglia predominantly rely on glycolysis, whereas reparative or anti-inflammatory phenotypes primarily utilize oxidative phosphorylation. Targeting glycolytic pathways to limit the polarization of microglia toward proinflammatory states has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for CNS diseases.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Infections trigger complex immune responses, with conserved as well as disease-specific characteristics.


METHODS
Proteomic screening technology and gene expression analysis were used here to define the immune response in infants, with their first episode of febrile urinary tract infection. Urine and peripheral blood samples were obtained at enrollment and at follow-up, after 6 months.


RESULTS
Pair-wise proteomic analysis of urine samples detected a broad local cytokine response in urine; 20 of the 24 proteins were strongly activated during acute infection compared with follow-up. Functional profiling identified the response as a cytokine storm, and major innate immune response regulators and effector molecules were activated, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-33, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-γ. In addition, the adaptive immune response was activated, including CD40L, IL-2, Granzyme B, IL-10, IL-15 and PD-L1. Gene expression analysis of peripheral blood RNA detected a systemic cytokine storm profile, which was more pronounced in infants with renal involvement, defined by positive acute dimercaptosuccinic acid scans, than in infants with febrile urinary tract infection without renal involvement.


CONCLUSIONS
Local and systemic hyperactivation of innate immunity characterizes acute pyelonephritis, a common and severe bacterial infection in childhood and a significant cause of urosepsis and mortality in adults.

        <tr id="Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is highly infectious and pathogenic. Novel coronavirus infection can not only cause respiratory diseases but also lead to multiple organ damage through direct or indirect mechanisms, in which the liver is one of the most frequently affected organs. It has been reported that 15–65% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients experience liver dysfunction, mainly manifested as mild to moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Severe patients may progress to liver failure, develop hepatic encephalopathy, or have poor coagulation function. The mechanisms underlying this type of liver injury are complex. Pathways—including direct viral infection (via ACE2 receptors), immune-mediated responses (e.g., cytokine storm), ischemic/hypoxic liver damage, thrombosis, oxidative stress, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), and the gut–liver axis—remain largely speculative and lack robust clinical causal evidence. In contrast, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) has been established as a well-defined causative factor using the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM). Treatment should simultaneously consider antiviral therapy and liver protection therapy. This article systematically reviewed the mechanism, clinical diagnosis, treatment, and management strategies of COVID-19-related liver injury and discussed the limitations of current research and the future directions, hoping to provide help for the diagnosis and treatment of such patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation and impaired protein clearance are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Central to these processes are microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, which normally maintain brain homeostasis by clearing amyloid-beta (Aβ) and other misfolded proteins through phagocytosis and receptor-mediated degradation. However, in both AD and HAND, microglial dysfunction promotes ongoing inflammation, impaired Aβ clearance, and progressive neuronal damage. This review synthesizes evidence from human and animal studies showing how key microglial pattern recognition receptors, including the Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and scavenger receptors (SR-AI/II, CD36, SR-BI, CD163), coordinate Aβ sensing, uptake, and inflammatory responses. We describe how HIV infection and viral proteins such as the trans-activator of transcription (Tat) and glycoprotein 120 (gp120) disrupt these pathways by altering receptor expression, lysosomal function, and microglial metabolism, creating a cycle of neurotoxicity and amyloid buildup. We further highlight current scientific gaps in elucidating how HIV affects microglial function and implications for HAND.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by recognizing pathogens and initiating immune responses. Despite extensive research over three decades, current methods lack the resolution to measure ligand-induced TLR4 receptor dynamics at the earliest stages of signaling, relying instead on downstream outputs such as gene expression and cytokine secretion. Here, we present the illuminating TLR4 (iTLR4) assay, a novel Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-based platform that provides real-time insights into TLR4 receptor-level events in live cells. The iTLR4 assay demonstrates, for the first time, that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces stable interactions between intracellular domains of TLR4 monomers, with an EC50 of 660 EU/mL. Kinetic analysis revealed a gradual, sustained increase in the BRET signal over time. Additionally, the assay uncovered subtle mechanistic differences among functional antagonists. While all antagonists completely abolished LPS-induced IL-8 secretion, the assay demonstrated that at the receptor level LPS-RS completely inhibited the LPS-induced BRET signal, TAK-242 partially inhibited it and (+)-naloxone potentiated it. The assay also identified potential regulatory roles for CD14 and MD2 in naloxone stereoisomer activity, marking the first report of such mechanistic differences. These findings highlight the unique capabilities of the iTLR4 assay to track nuanced TLR4 receptor dynamics, enabling high-throughput screening of TLR4-specific modulators. This platform provides critical insights into ligand-induced signaling, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutics targeting TLR4-related diseases and advancing our understanding of innate immune responses.">

 Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a challenge for immunotherapy due to profound immune evasion and a highly suppressive tumor microenvironment. We developed EVOVs—extracellular vesicles derived from glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) infected with oncolytic HSV-1—serving as vaccine-like immune activators. We show that EVOVs reprogram immune-tumor interactions and restore anti-tumor immunity across integrated preclinical models.



 Patient-derived GSCs (n=6) were infected ex vivo with OV (MOI 0.1 or mock-treated), and EVOVs and EVs were collected after 12h. Proteomic profiling, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and electron microscopy assessed vesicle quality and cargo. Human PBMCs (n=7) were treated with EVs or EVOVs, followed by flow cytometry, cytokine assays, GSC spheroid co-cultures, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). For co-cultures, multiplex immunofluorescence imaging was performed using the Rarecyte Orion™ platform. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a humanized NSG mouse model (n=16) using flow cytometry and spatial transcriptomics (10x Genomics Visium).



 EVOVs incorporated pathogen-associated molecular patterns from OV without carrying infectious particles. Proteomic profiling showed enrichment in immune-related pathways and enhanced signatures of NK, NKT, CD4⁺, and CD8⁺ T cells. Notably, EVOV stimulation induced a robust activation of PBMCs, significantly increasing the secretion of IFN-γ, IL-12p70, and IP-10 (p<0.05). In co-cultures, EVOV-primed PBMCs enhanced GSC killing, confirmed by Orion™ multiplex imaging showing increased infiltration of CD8⁺ GrB⁺ effector T cells and reduced PD-L1⁺ and CD11c⁺ cells. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed upregulated interferon signaling and MHC-I antigen presentation in GSCs, and activation of IFNα/γ programs in immune cells.In humanized NSG mice, EVOV treatment led to a significant reduction in exhausted PD1⁺ CD8⁺ T cells and a notable increase in activated CD4⁺ T cells in the peripheral blood. Importantly, 10x Genomics Visium analysis confirmed a significant immune infiltration into tumors and a remarkable decrease in PD1⁺ and LAG-3⁺ inhibitory markers.



 EVOVs reshape the glioblastoma immune landscape, reversing tumor-induced suppression and restoring anti-tumor immunity. This strategy offers a powerful new avenue for immunotherapy in GBM and holds promise for extending its benefits to other therapy-resistant malignancies.

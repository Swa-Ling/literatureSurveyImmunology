        <tr id="At this stage in the COVID-19 pandemic, most infections are "breakthrough" infections that occur in individuals with prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. To refine long-term vaccine strategies against emerging variants, we examined both innate and adaptive immunity in breakthrough infections. We performed single-cell transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional profiling of primary and breakthrough infections to compare immune responses from unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals during the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave. Breakthrough infections were characterized by a less activated transcriptomic profile in monocytes and natural killer cells, with induction of pathways limiting monocyte migratory potential and natural killer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed a female-specific increase in transcriptomic and proteomic activation of multiple innate immune cell subsets during breakthrough infections. These insights suggest that prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prevents overactivation of innate immune responses during breakthrough infections with discernible sex-specific patterns and underscore the potential of harnessing vaccines in mitigating pathologic immune responses resulting from overactivation.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations in infants and poses a significantly higher risk of respiratory failure than SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. We analyzed blood samples from infants (median age 2.3 months) with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 30), RSV (n = 19), and healthy controls (n = 17) using single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, and cytokine profiling. Both viruses triggered comparable interferon responses across PBMC subsets but differed in NK cell and inflammatory responses. Severe RSV cases showed reduced NK cell frequencies, lower IFNG expression, and decreased chromatin accessibility at T-BET and EOMES binding sites. RSV infections were also associated with increased CD4+ TEMRA, memory Treg and transitional B cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was characterized by stronger pro-inflammatory signatures, including increased NFKB pathway activity and higher serum TNF concentrations. These findings highlight distinct immune responses to RSV and SARS-CoV-2, providing insights that may inform clinical decisions.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that is one of the most significant challenges to public health over the past few years. Most people are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but older adults are more vulnerable. Aging is one of the major risk factors for the detrimental consequences of COVID-19, likely due to chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, both of which are the characteristics of old age. Immunosenescence refers to the weakening of the immune system with age while inflammaging describes the low-grade chronic inflammation seen in older individuals. One key aspect of human aging is immune deficiency. During aging, our body's defense system weakens, resulting in decreased responses to infection by novel pathogens and a reduced ability to become immunized. The presence of chronic inflammation and viral infection in old age may cause several adverse unpredictable outcomes increasing the propensity and severity of the disease and requires to be considered, enabling people to better prepare for the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. This requires consideration so that individuals can better be prepared to address the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. In this review, we discuss the clinical characteristics of elderly COVID-19 patients and survey the associated molecular pathways that are pivotal for the interactions of the coronavirus and host cellular responses, including immunosenescence, inflammation, telomere attrition, impaired autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in major aging signaling pathways, which are crucial for the discovery of new therapeutic and preventive methods in the ongoing pandemic.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact globally, yet African populations exhibited unexpectedly lower rates of severe disease and mortality. We investigated the potential role of pre-existing immunity in shaping the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Africa. Methods Plasma collected from Senegalese female sex workers prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was screened for SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus (hCoV) antibodies by virion immunoblots. For antibody-reactive plasma, paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by fusion proteins and IFN-γ cellular responses were assessed via ELISPOT. Results We observed substantial levels of pre-existing cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, stemming from prior exposure to seasonal hCoVs. Our antibody analysis revealed a 23.5% (47/200) seroprevalence rate against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N). These samples were then probed for antibodies against hCoV spike (S) and/or N antigens; 85.1% (40/47), 70.2% (33/47), and 95.7% (45/47) were antibody reactive against hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, or hCoV-HKU1, respectively. Our analysis of cellular responses also demonstrated cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 with 80.0% (36/45) and 82.2% (37/45) showing IFN-γ responses against S and N, respectively. A unique pre-pandemic subject had cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies with detectable neutralization and cross-reactive cellular responses. Conclusion These findings suggest that prior hCoV exposure may induce cross-reactive adaptive immunity, potentially contributing to protection against COVID-19. Our study provides unique data on the dynamics of hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 immunity in Senegal and underscores the importance of understanding the role of pre-existing immunity in shaping COVID-19 outcomes globally.">

        <tr id="Current understanding of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and host responses driving the pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate gene expression patterns during acute SARS-CoV-2 illness. Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples. We also generated expression data on the human nose organoid model during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The human nose organoid-generated host transcriptional response captured many aspects of responses observed in the above patient samples, while suggesting the existence of distinct host responses to SARS-CoV-2 depending on the cellular context, involving both epithelial and cellular immune responses. Our findings provide a catalog of SARS-CoV-2 host response genes changing over time and magnitude of these host responses were significantly correlated to viral load.">

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to have neurotropism and therefore to lead to not only peripheral inflammatory responses but also neuroinflammation. Because the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), can be found in many intraocular tissues, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also contribute to persistent intraocular neuroinflammation, microcirculation dysfunction and ocular symptoms. Increased awareness of neuroinflammation and future research on interventional strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are important for improving long-term outcomes, reducing disease burden, and improving quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this review is to focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and intraocular neuroinflammation and to discuss current evidence and future perspectives, especially possible connections between conditions and potential treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Type I interferons exert their antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including but not limited to LY6E, CH25H, IFITM2/3, and IFIH1. However, the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of action of most ISGs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet fully understood. By screening 109 ISG-knockout cell lines, we identify that phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an interferon-inducible protein, acts as a crucial restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells lacking PLSCR1 are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, overexpression of PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depletion of PLSCR1 enhances cellular entry of both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by specifically downregulating plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the virus's receptor, without affecting the overall levels of ACE2 within the cell. As such, we unraveled previously unappreciated mechanisms by which PLSCR1 exerts its restrictive effect on SARS-CoV-2. These data provide new insights into the interplay between host innate antiviral immunity and SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on novel antiviral therapeutics.


IMPORTANCE
Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been identified as a critical host restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we demonstrated that PLSCR1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry by downregulating the plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for viral entry. Our findings elucidate a novel host-pathogen interaction that not only deepens our understanding of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 but offers potential strategies for therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a deadly human viral disease with a high rate of infection, morbidity, and mortality. Although vaccines and antiviral treatments are available, hospitalizations remain steady, and concerns about long-term consequences persist. Therefore, there is a great urgency to develop novel therapies. Here, we analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication while building an antiviral cellular defense. Our study reveals that miR-155 expression is elevated in patients with COVID-19. Using a mouse model transgenic for human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2, we evaluated the potential of anti-miR-155 therapy. Treating SARS-CoV-2-infected mice with anti-miR-155 significantly reduced miR-155 expression, improved survival, and slightly increased body weight. Notably, these mice showed altered expression of cytokines in the lungs. These findings suggest anti-miR-155 could be a promising therapy to mitigate the cytokine storm and long-lasting symptoms induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, improving public health outcomes and enhancing global pandemic preparedness.">

Among the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, three—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2—are associated with severe illness and significant morbidity. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cellular entry. The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly mutable, leading to the emergence of variants that alter disease pathology and transmission dynamics. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified these mutations into variants of concern (VOCs), variants of interest (VOIs), and variants under monitoring (VUMs). This review provides an in-depth analysis of both historical and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, summarizes recent advancements in diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and discusses current therapeutic strategies for COVID-19, with a particular focus on virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines developed in recent years.

        <tr id="In recent years, the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to over 670 million infections and nearly 7 million deaths worldwide. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has precipitated a significant public health crisis. The prevalence of liver function abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 53% among healthy individuals or patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and shows a positive correlation with disease severity; moreover, specific adaptive immune responses can influence the trajectory and outcomes of COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 may impact autoimmunity through mechanisms such as excessive stimulation of immune responses and molecular mimicry, particularly in genetically predisposed individuals. Currently, the overall mutational trend of SARS-CoV-2 indicates heightened infectivity and immune evasion capabilities. Consequently, vaccination remains crucial for universal protection against this disease. Nevertheless, alongside the widespread implementation of vaccination programs globally, an increasing number of cases have been documented where COVID-19 vaccination appears to trigger new-onset autoimmune hepatitis; yet definitive evidence is still pending elucidation regarding causality. In this review, we analyse the clinical-immunological characteristics, risks associated with severe disease progression, and prognosis for AIH patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; discuss the detrimental effects exerted by SARS-CoV-2 on hepatic function; summarise the mechanisms and attributes leading to new-onset AIH; as well as provide insights into how vaccination may interfere with autoimmunity processes. We continue to underscore the significance of vaccination while aiming to enhance awareness concerning potential risks associated with it—this could facilitate better management strategies for autoimmune diseases along with appropriate adjustments in vaccination protocols. Although the precise triggering mechanism linking COVID-19-related events to AIH remains unclear, existing evidence suggests that this relationship is far from coincidental.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly enhanced our understanding of CD8+ T cell immunity and their role in natural infection and vaccine-induced protection. Rapid and early SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses have been associated with efficient viral clearance and mild disease. Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses can compensate for waning, morbidity-related, and iatrogenic reduction of humoral immunity. After infection or vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells are formed, which mount an efficient recall response in the event of breakthrough infection and help to protect from severe disease. Due to their breadth and ability to target mainly highly conserved epitopes, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are also able to cross-recognize epitopes of viral variants, thus maintaining immunity even after the emergence of viral evolution. In some cases, however, CD8+ T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. In particular, delayed and uncontrolled, e.g., nonspecific and hyperactivated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses have been linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes. In this minireview, we summarize the tremendous knowledge about CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination that has been gained over the past 5 years, while also highlighting the critical knowledge gaps that remain.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 involves several organs, but its basis remains poorly understood. Some infected cells in mice survive the acute infection and persist for extended periods in the respiratory tract but not in other tissues. Here, we describe two experimental models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to assess the effect of viral virulence on previously infected cells. Both approaches use lineage tracking of previously infected cells. In mice infected with a highly pathogenic mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, alveolar type 2 cells (AT2) but not alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells survived the acute infection. These cells became activated, differentiated into an AT2-to-AT1 transitional cell state (KRT8+ pre-alveolar type 1 transitional cell state). Additionally, nearby uninfected AT2 cells upregulated the transitional marker KRT8, thereby contributing to lung regeneration. In mice sensitized to infection by transduction with Ad5-hACE2, the infection is nonlethal, and AT1 cells survived the infection. Consequently, recovery in these mice was more rapid. Taken together, these results provide an explanation for how SARS-CoV-2 virulence contributes to poor outcomes and affects clinical recovery and lung regeneration. We also identified a new mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts lung recovery, even at times when infectious virus cannot be detected.


IMPORTANCE
A major consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is that many survivors have long-term sequelae, which are not well understood. These involve many organs, with the respiratory tract being a common site of long-term effects. Many of these sequelae can be found in mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we have focused on the lungs, with particular interest in the fate and role of cells that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and survived the acute infection. We found that some infected cells survive acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and that these surviving cells both contribute to the immune response in the lungs and are involved in lung recovery. These findings illustrate previously unexplored aspects of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia and may be relevant for understanding aspects of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The reaction of different cell types to prion infections is highly heterogeneous. While neurons experience spine retraction and eventually death, astrocytes and microglia undergo strong activation and proliferation. Here we analyzed the cell-type specific responses to prion diseases by establishing a spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of mice infected with RML prion strain. Brain areas with severe neuronal loss, such as the thalamus and cerebellum, experienced intense microgliosis. Starting from 30 weeks post-inoculation, we observed the accumulation of a novel microglial subpopulation characterized by strong expression of Gpnmb in these brain regions. The molecular profile of Gpnmb+ microglia reflected a state of enhanced phagocytic activity with upregulation of genes associated with lysosomal function and degradation, including vacuolar ATPase V0 domain subunit d2 (Atp6v0d2) and Galectin-3 (Lgals3). In microglial-like, murine BV2 cells, Gpnmb upregulation was induced by soluble find-me signals released during apoptosis, but not by apoptotic bodies or prion accumulation. Gpnmb ablation in BV2 cells impaired their ability to phagocytose apoptotic cells, underscoring its essential role in maintaining microglial phagocytosis. Our findings define Gpnmb⁺ microglia as a distinct, apoptosis-driven phagocytic state, linking neuronal loss to microglial activation in prion disease. The upregulation of GPNMB in sCJD patients, along with its role in apoptotic clearance and lysosomal function, positions it as both a key regulator of microglial responses and a potential biomarker of disease progression.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus responsible for COVID-19, interacts with the host immune system through complex mechanisms that significantly influence disease outcomes, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity. These interactions are crucial in determining the disease's severity and the host's ability to clear the virus. Given the virus's substantial socioeconomic impact, high morbidity and mortality rates, and public health importance, understanding these mechanisms is essential. This article examines the diverse innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2's structural proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, along with nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open reading frames. These proteins play pivotal roles in immune modulation, facilitating viral replication, evading immune detection, and contributing to severe inflammatory responses such as cytokine storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus employs strategies like suppressing type I interferon production and disrupting key antiviral pathways, including MAVS, OAS-RNase-L, and PKR. This study also explores the immune pathways that govern the activation and suppression of immune responses throughout COVID-19. By analyzing immune sensing receptors and the responses initiated upon recognizing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, this review elucidates the complex pathways associated with the innate immune response in COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights for therapeutic interventions and informs public health strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="A major challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been assessing the intensity, dynamics, and determinants of the antibody responses after infection and/or vaccination. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody responses among naturally infected individuals and individuals who achieved hybrid immunity in a large Canadian cohort. We demonstrate that anti-Spike IgGs and neutralizing antibody dynamics vary greatly among individuals with COVID-19, in peak antibody levels, rate of waning, and longevity of the antibody response. Additionally, we found an association between robust antibody responses and individuals with severe COVID-19 clinical symptoms during the first-month post-symptom onset. For individuals who achieved hybrid immunity, a robust increase in anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibodies followed the first vaccination dose; however, there was a minimal increase in the anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibody titers after administration of the second dose of the vaccine. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies elicited by the wild-type virus alone were largely ineffective against emerging variants of concern in our natural infection-only cohort, in contrast to a much broader and more robust neutralization profile observed in individuals who achieved hybrid immunity. Our findings emphasize the need for global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts to further sustain protective immune responses required to minimize viral spread and disease severity in the population. As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, understanding the interplay between previous infections, vaccine durability, and virus evolution will be critical for guiding ongoing vaccination strategies.


IMPORTANCE
A major challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been assessing the intensity, dynamics, and determinants of the antibody response after infection and/or vaccination. Our paper addresses this in a large Canadian cohort with antibody responses that were generated by natural infection as well as vaccine in some persons studied.">

However, the peak frequencies of Spike-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in PLWH were lower than those in HIV-negative controls. In addition, the expansion of activated B cells, memory B cells and plasma cells after primary vaccination was observed, but the percentages of these cells were decreased at T6 and were comparable to those at T0. Additionally, the percentages of activated T cells, exhausted T cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with enhanced functional activity were increased following the administration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, PLWH had lower percentages of plasma cells, RBD-specific B cells, circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells and CD38+ cTfh cells, and the percentages of the latter two types of cells were positively correlated with the titer of neutralizing antibodies, indicating these differences may account for the weaker immune responses induced in PLWH.These data suggest that specific B-cell and T-cell responses could be sustained for at least one year after receiving the third vaccination. Our findings emphasize that the weak SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses induced in PLWH have implications for clinical decision-making and public health policy for PLWH with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

        <tr id="T-cell ageing may be a key factor in the disproportionate severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older populations. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients, treatment involving the use of monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 usually involves the administration of high doses but has not been very effective at preventing complications or fatality, highlighting the need for additional research into anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, particularly for older populations. In this study, it is discovered that older persons with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has weaker T-cell responses. Therefore the development and characterization of spike-targeting T-cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) full-length human immunoglobulin Gs with enhanced efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is described. Using S-targeting TDBs, polyclonal T cells are guided to target and destroy S-expressing cells, preventing the cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby eliminating the need for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Using animal models of COVID-19, it is shown that the selective activation of T cells improves the efficiency of treatment in preinfected mice by attenuating disease-induced weight loss and death. The significance of T-cell-based immunity during infection is highlighted by the findings. These results have implications for better clinical effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 and the development of T-cell-dependent medicines for the elderly population.">

Understanding the mechanisms of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for addressing COVID-19–related liver pathology and developing targeted therapies. This editorial discusses the significance of ACE2 in hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, drawing on the research by Jacobs et al.

This work describes the preclinical discovery efforts that led to the invention of PF-07321332 (nirmatrelvir, 14), a potent and orally active inhibitor of the SARS CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) enzyme. At the outset we focused on modifying PF-00835231 (1) discovered in 2004 as a potent inhibitor of the SARS CoV-1 Mpro with poor systemic exposure. Our effort was focused on modifying 1 with the goal of engineering in oral bioavailability by design, while maintaining cellular potency and low metabolic clearance.

        <tr id="Since late 2021, Omicron variants have dominated the epidemiological scenario as the most successful severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sublineages, driving new and breakthrough infections globally over the past two years. In this study, we investigated for the first time the host salivary response of COVID-19 patients infected with Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5) by using an untargeted four-dimensional data-independent acquisition (4D-DIA)-based proteomics approach. We identified 137 proteins whose abundance levels differed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups. Salivary signatures were mainly enriched in ribosomal proteins, linked to mRNAviral translation, protein synthesis and processing, immune innate, and antiapoptotic signaling. The higher abundance of 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAG, YWHAQ, YWHAE, and SFN) in saliva, first reported here, may be associated with increased infectivity and improved viral replicative fitness. We also identified seven proteins (ACTN1, H2AC2, GSN, NDKA, CD109, GGH, and PCYOX) that yielded comprehension into Omicron infection and performed outstandingly in screening patients with COVID-19 in a hospital setting. This panel also presented an enhanced anti-COVID-19 and anti-inflammatory signature, providing insights into disease severity, supported by comparisons with other proteome data sets. The salivary signature provided valuable insights into the host’s response to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, shedding light on the pathophysiology of COVID-19, particularly in cases associated with mild disease. It also underscores the potential clinical applications of saliva for disease screening in hospital settings. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD054133.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis is a rare but serious complication of COVID-19. The host response correlates of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis remain unclear, thereby limiting therapeutic development. We therefore performed proteomic and transcriptomic phenotyping of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis in Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries. We included a bioenergetics focus given the emerging role of mitochondrial function in enteroviral myocarditis. Early (<30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). Values are log10 transformed, and p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons across the full twenty biomarkers (six shown here; * indicates a p-value < 0.05). CRP = C-Reactive Protein; IFNG = Interferon Gamma ; PCT= Procalcitonin; TNFR1 = Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1; DDIMER = D-dimer; and IL1RA = Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Methods We previously adjudicated five unvaccinated pre-Delta SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis cases among 5265 MHS beneficiaries who enrolled into the EPICC study with COVID-19; four of these cases had blood collected. We matched myocarditis cases 1:10 with sex, age, comorbidity, and blood sampling-time matched controls (SARS-CoV-2 infection with no myocarditis) from the EPICC study. Cases and controls underwent comparison of early (< 30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay (with multiplicity adjustment). We also performed early whole blood transcriptomic sequencing with DESeq2 and GSEA analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways, including mitochondrial (mtDNA) regulated innate immune pathways (with FDR for multiple comparisons). Gene set enrichment analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). FDR = False Discovery Rate; NES = Normalized enrichment score. Results We detected higher post-infection Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (TNFR1) and procalcitonin (PCT) plasma concentrations in myocarditis cases versus matched controls (TNFR1: 0.33 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.032; PCT: 0.59 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.02) (Fig 1). We noted no statistically significant difference in the 18 other proteomic markers tested. GSEA analysis noted upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS pathway genes, and downregulated mtDNA innate immune genes, in cases versus controls (FDR < 0.05) (Fig 2). Conclusion In this MHS study, SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis was associated with elevation of TNFR1 and PCT secretion, upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS gene expression, and downregulated mtDNA innate immunity. While constrained by small sample sizes of a rare complication, these biomarker associations prompt mechanistic studies which may direct development of therapies for myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other respiratory viral pathogens.

        <tr id="Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus persists in multiple organs due to its tropism for various tissues, including the skeletal system. This study investigates the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including both ancestral and Omicron viral strains, on differentiating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the precursor cells, into osteoblasts. Although both viral strains can productively infect osteoblasts, precursor cell infection remained abortive. Viral exposure during osteoblast differentiation demonstrates that both variants inhibit mineral and organic matrix deposition. This is accompanied by reduced expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the upregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) strongly suggests that the ancestral and Omicron variants may disrupt bone homeostasis by promoting osteoclast differentiation, ultimately leading to the formation of bone-resorbing cells. This process is dependent of spike glycoprotein since its neutralization significantly reduced the effect of infective SARS-CoV-2 and UV-C inactivated virus. This study underscores the capacity of ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants to disrupt osteoblast differentiation, a process essential for preserving the homeostasis and functionality of bone tissue.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Coronaviruses are endemic in the human population and include both seasonal viruses as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), with exposure history differing between children and adults. We sought to identify age-specific differences in memory CD4 T cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), as quantitative and qualitative differences in immune function may be responsible for age-related variation in disease presentation. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from cohorts of children and adults enrolled pre-2019 and following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Subjects enrolled post-pandemic had a history of COVID-19 vaccination. Cells were stimulated with peptide pools representing the unique and more cross-reactive portions of the S protein for 24 hours, with cytokine release blocked for the last 4 hours of coculture. Subsets of S-specific CD4 T cells were identified using a 31-plex spectral flow cytometry panel. Results Pre-pandemic, adults had a higher frequency of activated IFNγ+ CD4 T cells specific for the S protein compared to children, with boosting of responses in both adults and children following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, the CD4 T cell response to the S protein was Th1 biased, with adults having a greater proportion of cells expressing IFNγ, IL2 and TNFα. When cytokine-expressing, antigen-specific CD4 T cells were subsetted by CD45RA and CCR7 expression, there was a more naïve phenotype pre-pandemic, with transition to an effector memory phenotype post-2019. Conclusion A greater magnitude of CD4 T cells specific for the S protein was detected in adults pre-pandemic, with this reactivity boosted in both children and adults following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Boosting of reactivity to both unique and conserved S protein epitopes in children and adults suggested that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via vaccination did not preferentially boost memory CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes. Post-pandemic, there was a shift to a more Th1 phenotype together with a gain in cytokine-producing CD4 T cells with a phenotype consistent with effector memory. Disclosures Jennifer L.

        <tr id="Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) ligands effectively reduce immunopathological damage in viral pneumonia models. Specifically, S1P1 ligands inhibit cytokine storm and help preserve lung endothelial barrier integrity. We recently showed that the S1P receptor ligand ozanimod can be safely administered to hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibiting severe symptoms of viral pneumonia, with potential clinical benefits. Here, we extend on this study and investigate the impact of ozanimod on key features of the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. We quantified circulating cytokine levels, peripheral immune cell numbers, proportions and activation status; we also monitored the quality of the humoral response by assessing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) antibodies. Our findings reveal that patients receiving ozanimod during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significantly reduced numbers of circulating monocytes compared with those receiving standard care. Correspondingly, in the ozanimod-treated group, circulating levels of C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) were decreased. While treatment with ozanimod negatively impacted the humoral response to COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, it did not impair the development of a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in vaccinated patients. These findings suggest that ozanimod influences key immune mechanisms during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="While Influenza Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are considered as a significant health burden in children, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes milder diseases in this age group compared to adults. To investigate the involvement of the upper respiratory tract human airway epithelium (HAE) in this pattern, we established an in-house model of reconstituted HAE cultured in air-liquid interface from nasal swabs of children and adults and characterised it before and after ex vivo respiratory viral infections using focused and unbiased approaches. Fully differentiated paediatric HAE exhibited an increasing induction level of genes related to mucociliary clearance, while higher expression of innate immune pathways was found in the ones from adults. While similar viral replication kinetics in both age groups were shown for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A Virus (IAV), RSV and Rhinovirus (RV) infection, transcriptomic analysis showed stronger and earlier induction of IFN-related pathways in SARS-CoV-2-infected HAE from children compared to IAV, RSV and RV. IAV and RSV had the weakest innate immune response increase in HAE from children versus adults. RV infection showed an intermediate pattern, resembling SARS-CoV-2 more than RSV or IAV. Our work demonstrates a distinct sensing of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other respiratory viruses ex vivo, which may contribute to the milder course of disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected children and argues for a role of early virus-HAE interaction in shaping viral pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that innate immune responses towards respiratory viruses are virus-specific and differ between age groups. Hence, findings on SARS-CoV-2 cannot be extrapolated to other respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Dendritic cells (DCs) in severe cases exhibited reduced proportions and attenuated expression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86), alongside increased cytochrome c expression, indicating impaired antigen presentation and enhanced apoptosis. NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and -2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) that have caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, a better understanding of host responses to β-CoVs would provide insights into the pathogenesis of these viruses to identify potential targets for medical countermeasures. In this study, our objective is to use a systems biology approach to explore the magnitude and scope of innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection over time in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3/2B4 cells). Total RNA extracted at 12, 24, and 48 hours after β-CoVs or mock infection of Calu-3/2B4 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis to select genes whose expressions were significantly modulated post-infection. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 stimulate similar yet distinct innate antiviral signaling pathways in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that many genes related to the viral life cycle, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated at multiple time points. Based on their profound modulation upon infection by SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron BA.1, four ISGs, i.e., bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 11 (CXCL11), and Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1), were identified as potential drug targets against β-CoVs. Our findings suggest that these genes affect both pathogens directly and indirectly through the innate immune response, making them potential targets for host-directed antivirals. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induce differential effects on host innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immunocompromised patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often have prolonged viral shedding, and some are clinically suspected of reinfection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, data on this issue are limited. This study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 variants in serially collected respiratory samples from immunocompromised patients with prolonged viral shedding for over 12 weeks or relapsed viral shedding after at least 2 weeks of viral clearance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
From February 2022 to September 2023, we prospectively enrolled immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had hematologic malignancies or had undergone transplantation and were admitted to a tertiary hospital. Weekly saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from enrolled patients for at least 12 weeks after diagnosis. Genomic RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on samples, and those testing positive underwent viral culture to isolate the live virus. Spike gene full sequencing via Sanger sequencing and real-time reverse transcription-PCR for detecting mutation genes were conducted to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants.


RESULTS
Among 116 enrolled patients, 20 with prolonged or relapsed viral shedding were screened to identify the variants. Of these 20 patients, 7 (35%) exhibited evidence of re-infection; one of 8 patients with prolonged viral shedding and 6 of 12 with relapsed viral shedding were reinfected with SARS-CoV-2.


CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that approximately one-third of immunocompromised patients with persistent or relapsed viral shedding had reinfection with different variants of SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are known to impact cellular and humoral immune response in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). In this study, we performed in-depth SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell profiling using flow cytometry. T-cell immunity in pwMS with or without DMTs was evaluated before a first SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccination and at one-, two- and six-month follow-up. T-cell stimulation without SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens was used as a control. T-cell response was compared to B-cell response by evaluating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We observed an upregulation of specific subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, our results demonstrate the induction of a broad and distinct CD4+ T-cell response in pwMS even on anti-CD20 treatment and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. This was particularly seen in CD4+high and CD4+CD154+ T cells. Our results do not support the induction of a CD8+ T-cell immune response. While humoral immune response was impaired in pwMS during ocrelizumab and fingolimod treatment, there was evidence of a compensatory upregulation of subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells at low levels of seroconversion in pwMS. In conclusion, our results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the adaptive immune response in pwMS following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.">

        <tr id="Although emerging data have revealed the critical role of memory CD8+ T cells in preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and its memory and innate-like subsets in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with various disease manifestations in an HLA-restricted fashion remain to be understood. Here, we show the strong association of protective cellular immunity with mild COVID-19 and unique cell types against SARS-CoV-2 virus in an HLA-A2 restricted manner. ELISpot assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in mild COVID-19 patients are significantly higher than in severe patients, whereas neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 virus significantly correlate with disease severity. Single-cell analyses of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells, which recognize highly conserved immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes, demonstrate divergent profiles in unvaccinated patients with mild versus severe disease. CD8+ T-cell types including cytotoxic KLRB1+ CD8αα cells with innate-like T-cell signatures, IFNGhiID3hi memory cells and IL7R+ proliferative stem cell-like memory cells are preferentially observed in mild COVID-19, whereas distinct terminally-differentiated T-cell subsets are predominantly detected in severe COVID-19: highly activated FASLhi T-cell subsets and early-terminated or dysfunctional IL4R+ GATA3+ stem cell-like memory T-cell subset. In conclusion, our findings suggest that unique and contrasting SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell profiles may dictate COVID-19 severity. Graphical abstract.

 The SARS-CoV-2 virus started the global COVID-19 outbreak that is still ongoing. Chronic lung inflammation and a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm produced by SARS-CoV-2-infected human respiratory epithelial cells for others, the cytokine storm stood for a strong inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection. Among the organs, gastrointestinal tract, brain, cardiovascular system, liver, kidneys, microcirculation, eyes, and so on, cytokine storms can harm Considering the everyday mortality, research on targeted antiviral medicine compositions and vaccination production is under progress. Prebiotics seem to be immunomodulators and antiviral agents, therefore strengthening the human immune system according recent scientific data. Prebiotics enhanced the maturation, differentiation, and lymphocyte and macrophage proliferation, thereby increasing COVID-19 immunity. They also triggered the reticuloendothelial system, raised the fraction of CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), and improved COVID-19 immunity by this means. Dietary interventions like prebiotics and anti-SARS-CoV-2 have opened opportunities for the development of microbial therapeutics intended either to prevent or treat COVID-19. Prebiotics are specialized dietary components necessary for the survival and nutritional absorption of gut probiotic microorganisms.">

        <tr id="The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor antibodies as a therapeutic agent to combat severe COVID-19. Given the constant evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants, the study aims to assess the potential of these inhibitors in adapting to new challenges and improving treatment outcomes. A comprehensive review of relevant literature was conducted using electronic databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The study analyzed the role of IL-6 inhibitors in combating SARS-CoV-2, focusing on their therapeutic potential in treating severe COVID-19 cases, particularly in controlling the overshooting immune response associated with cytokine storms. IL-6 inhibitors proved to be versatile and effective in attenuating severe immune responses, especially cytokine storms, which are common in advanced COVID-19 cases. The literature emphasizes their ability to regulate the immune system, reduce disease severity, and improve patient outcomes. Their efficacy in controlling the immune response and reducing disease severity makes IL-6 inhibitor antibodies a promising therapeutic strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants. Further research is needed to optimize their use and adaptability in evolving clinical scenarios.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 since 2019 caused substantial global morbidity and mortality and continues to burden healthcare systems worldwide. Public health measures implemented to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread also reduced circulation of other seasonal respiratory viruses, likely causing gaps in population-level immunity. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may dampen immune responses against other pathogens is highly debated and not well understood.Figure 1. VirScan analyses of serum samples pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (A) VirScan total epitope hits and geometric mean (gMean) of epitope binding (EB) scores for SARS-CoV-2 pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (B) gMean of EB scores for select pathogens pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Timepoints included in the VirScan analyses were between 15-174 days prior to and 31-155 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gray lines denote paired samples for individual subjects. Statistically significant adjusted p values of < 0.05 were determined using paired t test with Holm correction. Methods In 2022, we conducted a longitudinal study of immunocompetent adults ( > 18 years) with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination history and increased risk of social or occupational exposure to respiratory viruses. Subjects were followed for 6 months and weekly symptom surveys, blood samples at enrollment, 3 and 6 months post-enrollment, and nasal swabs at report of symptoms were collected. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR (OpenArray) for 27 respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Serum antibodies were assessed by VirScan PhIP-seq for specificity to a broad library of antigen epitopes for clinically relevant pathogens, measuring total epitope hits and epitope binding (EB) scores, a measure similar to antibody titer. Results Of 43 subjects with paired serum samples > 1 week prior to and > 28 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32 subjects with viral load < Ct 22.2 were assessed by VirScan. SARS-CoV-2 epitope hits and EB scores were significantly increased post-infection compared to pre-infection (Fig 1A). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with reduced EB scores for adenovirus D and S. aureus (Fig 1B). However, SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with a statistically significant decline of epitope hits or EB scores for most other clinically relevant pathogens. Conclusion We assessed broad changes in the antibody repertoires of subjects prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection for clinically relevant pathogens at the epitope level by VirScan. Together these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not associated with differential patterns of antibody repertoire kinetics for most non-coronavirus respiratory pathogens in immunocompetent adults. Further analyses in larger cohorts with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Disclosures Michael J.

        <tr id="Pulmonary fibrosis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19. β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, has been shown to be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis). In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-hACE2 cell model to evaluate the efficacy of the A549-hACE2 monoclonal cell line against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The A549-hACE2 cells were then subjected to either knockdown or overexpression of the effector β-catenin, and the modified cells were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we employed transcriptomics and raw letter analysis approaches to investigate other potential effects of β-catenin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We successfully established a model of cellular fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung-derived cells. This model can be utilized to investigate the molecular biological mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways associated with virus-induced lung fibrosis. The results of our mechanistic studies indicate that β-catenin plays a significant role in lung fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the inhibition of β-catenin mitigated the accumulation of mesenchymal stroma in A549-hACE2 cells. Additionally, β-catenin knockdown was found to facilitate multi-pathway crosstalk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that β-catenin overexpression did not exacerbate cellular fibrosis may be attributed to the activation of PPP2R2B.">

        <tr id="Introduction The innate immune response is an important first checkpoint in the evolution of an infection. Although adaptive immunity is generally considered the immune component that retains antigenic memory, innate immune responses can also be affected by previous stimulations. This study evaluated the impact of vaccination on innate cell activation by TLR7/8 agonist R848, as well as seasonal variations. Methods To this end, blood samples from a cohort of 304 food and retail workers from the Quebec City region were collected during three visits at 12-week intervals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils were isolated during the first and third visits and were stimulated with R848 to assess the innate immune response. Results Our results show that IL-8 production after stimulation decreased after vaccination. In addition, the IL-8 response was significantly different depending on the season when the visit occurred, for both COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Discussion This study highlights that innate immune responses can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and fluctuate seasonally.">

        <tr id="Introduction Global WHO data indicate that Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, such as Kenya, experienced reduced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severe-morbidity and mortality burdens relative to their more affluent counterparts in Europe, Asia, and North America. Methods We analysed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples collected from Kenya and Sweden before and during COVID-19. Pre-COVID-19 samples were available for 80 adults and 10 infants from Kenya, and 20 adults from Sweden. COVID-19 samples were available for 39 Kenyan adults. The samples were analysed for ex vivo IFN-{gamma} secretion using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent (ELISpot) assay following in vitro stimulations with overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein peptides. T-cells expressing IFN-{gamma}, IL-2, TNF-, CD154, and CD107a were assessed following similar stimulations, using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and multiparameter flow cytometry. Results 55.7% of the Kenyan pre-COVID-19 adults were classified as responders by ELISPOT responses to spike-protein peptides, compared with 28% of Swedish pre-COVID-19 adults (p = 0.04). The frequencies for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific TNF- CD4+, TNF- CD8+ and IFN-{gamma} CD8+ T-cell responses, tended to be higher in the Kenyan adults although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Pre-COVID-19 T-cell responses could contribute to lower morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in SSA relative to Europe, Asia, and North America.">

        <tr id="Context: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China. From the outset, this highly contagious and dangerous illness posed significant risks and challenges for global healthcare systems and populations. Scientists and healthcare professionals worldwide have been striving to develop effective treatments for severe acute respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection, employing both pre-existing and innovative approaches. However, a specific drug targeted explicitly against COVID-19 remains elusive. Despite the reduced prevalence of severe cases and the predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, COVID-19 continues to pose significant risks, particularly for polymorbid patient groups. This review focuses on the potential antiviral effects of promising new drugs, including ensitrelvir, clazakizumab, upamostat, and others. Evidence Acquisition: An analytical review was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases for publications related to promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2, their mechanisms of action, and potential therapeutic effects up to November 2024. Selection criteria included: (1) Free-text availability; (2) English language; (3) relevance to the publication's theme a total of 104 articles were initially selected. Of these, 27 articles were excluded for not meeting the free-text criterion, 14 were excluded due to language incompatibility, and 28 were excluded for thematic irrelevance. Ultimately, data from 35 articles were analyzed and summarized for this review. Results: Thirty-five scientific studies were reviewed to describe current paradigms and emerging concepts in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. Current drugs with proven efficacy include: (1) Combined monoclonal antibodies targeting the S-protein (casirivimab/imdevimab); (2) monoclonal antibody preparations against the S-protein (pemivibart; vilobelimab); (3) viral replication inhibitors (molnupiravir); (4) protease inhibitors (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir); (5) immunosuppressants (dexamethasone; tocilizumab). The review also highlights drugs under development targeting traditional pathways [e.g., viral protease, interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and those aimed at novel mechanisms (e.g., antigalectin-3; adhesion blockers). Conclusions: Although numerous drug effects and potential drug combinations for COVID-19 have been described, limited clinical trials and research focus on identifying novel treatment approaches. Comprehensive investigations are needed to assess and evaluate the risks of different treatment strategies, minimizing potential short- and long-term complications for patients. Such advancements will pave the way for more optimal and effective medical treatment of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The airway epithelium serves as a physical and immune barrier against inhaled insults. This tissue is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and following injury, the airway epithelium undergoes repair to restore barrier function. Though components of SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike glycoprotein essential in viral entry, have been shown to alter biological functions in various tissues, it is unclear how SARS-CoV-2 can impact airway epithelial functions, such as wound repair.In this study, 16HBE14o- epithelial monolayer cultures were treated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 subunit at 4 μg·mL−1or transfected with a plasmid expressing full-length spike glycoprotein. Secreted inflammatory mediators, markers of proliferation and cell-cycle arrest, culture proliferation, and wound closure measurements following mechanical injury were assessed.Spike treatment and transfection altered measures of culture proliferation and markers of proliferation and cell-cycle arrest. Secreted interleukin-6 but not interleukin-8 were significantly higher with spike S1 treatment, while both were significantly elevated with spike transfection. Wound closure was inhibited by both spike treatment and transfection, with significant reductions compared to control.SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 treatment and transfection can alter measures of proliferation, inflammation, and impair wound closure of 16HBE14o- airway epithelial cells. These results highlight how components of SARS-CoV-2 can impair functions of the airway epithelium independent of viral replication.">

        <tr id="Bipolar disorder (BD) is increasingly recognized as a disorder with both mitochondrial dysfunction and heightened inflammatory reactivity, yet their contribution to neuronal activity remains unclear. To address these gaps, this study utilizes iPSC-derived cerebral organoids (COs) from BD patients and healthy controls to model disease-specific metabolic and inflammatory dysfunction in a physiologically relevant system. BD COs exhibited mitochondrial impairment, dysregulated metabolic function, and increased nod-leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation sensitivity. Treatment with MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inhibitor, effectively rescued mitochondrial function and reduced inflammatory activation in both BD and control COs. Additionally, a Bioactive Flavonoid Extract (BFE) was explored as a potential therapeutic, demonstrating partial rescue of inflammasome activation. These findings highlight a mitochondria-inflammasome axis in BD pathophysiology and establish a novel platform for studying BD-associated cellular mechanisms, ultimately bridging the gap between molecular dysfunction and therapeutic development.">

We found SARS-CoV-2 viremia in 64% of participants at enrollment, and we could also quantify viremia in approximately half of those samples using an RT-PCR assay. Viremia was associated with increased risk of disease progression (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.0). Participants with viremia at baseline had lower SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody levels and higher pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including IP-10 (CXCL10), TNF-α, calprotectin, and CRP. Disease progression correlated with extracellular vesicle levels from multiple cell types in the convalescent but not acute phase of the disease. Male sex predicted worse disease outcome and was associated with higher baseline levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Viremia's strong predictive value for disease progression argues for further study of its use to predict which patients with COVID-19 might require more intensive therapy or monitoring.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has highlighted the critical importance of understanding protective long-lasting immune responses. This study investigates the epitope specificity, T cell receptor (TCR) usage, and phenotypic changes in SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells over time in convalescent individuals with COVID-19.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 28 unvaccinated individuals with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (6 identified as the D614G variant, clade 20C) and analyzed up to 12 months post-symptom onset. Antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) using specific dextramer and antibody reagents. TCR clonotypes and activation markers were characterized to explore T cell dynamics.SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited waning frequencies long-term, transitioning from memory-like to a naïve-like state. scRNAseq revealed specificity against both spike and non-spike antigens with increased CD95 and CD127 expression over time, indicating that naïve-like T cells may represent stem cell memory T cells, which are multipotent and self-renewing, likely important for long-lived immunity. TCR clonal expansion was observed mainly in memory T cells, with overlapping TCR beta chain (TRB)-complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences between participants, suggesting shared public TCR epitope-specific repertoires against SARS-CoV-2. Further, unique spike-specific CD4+ T cells with high CD95 and CD127 expression were identified, which may play a crucial role in long-term protection.This study highlights epitope-specificity heterogeneity, with some immunodominant responses, and suggests a potential role for long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. Shared TCR repertoires offers insights into cross-reactive and protective T cell clones, providing valuable information for optimizing vaccine strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings underscore the critical role of cellular immunity in long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and emphasizes the importance of understanding T cell dynamics.">

 Introduction:
 SARS-CoV-2 causes various neurological sequelae in COVID-19 survivors including fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19 illness, is also a major risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Clinical evidence suggests that reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a likely pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, and eNOS levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD . We hypothesize that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) deficiency contributes to brain endothelial dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and that SARS-CoV-2 infection accelerates the onset of VaD in eNOS-deficient mice.


 Methods:
 6-month-old eNOS+/- (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and WT male mice were infected with 1X10
 4
 -pfu mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2 intranasally, and animals were evaluated acutely out to 3-days-postinfection (3dpi) for changes in body weight and clinical signs of illness. Viral copy numbers and nuclear capsid were also quantified in lung and brain. Quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence were used to analyze markers of brain inflammation and senescence.


 Results:
 eNOS+/- infected mice exhibited more disease-associated weight loss (~15%) than WT-infected mice (~5 %). While infected WT and eNOS+/- had comparable pulmonary viral load, neither had detectable virus in the brain. Quantitative PCR analysis of whole brain-isolated mRNA showed increases in multiple proinflammatory mediators such as CCL2 and IL-6 and senescence markers such as p53 and p21 (eNOS
 +/-
 >> WT). Similarly, immunofluorescent analysis showed increased Iba1 (microglia marker) fluorescent intensity in the cortex of infected mice (eNOS
 +/-
 >> WT).


 Conclusions:
 eNOS+/- deficiency, a clinically relevant model of VaD, worsens acute SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity, neuroinflammation and markers of brain senescence despite comparable pulmonary viral load (to WT-infected animals) and absence of virus in the brain. While the potential effects of SARS-COV-2 on cognitive decline in this model will be assessed in future studies, this is the first experimental evidence demonstrating a link between eNOS and neuropathology associated with COVID-19.

Cellular senescence has been implicated as a key pathogenic mechanism. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of regorafenib, a previously characterized senomorphic drug, for severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected K18-hACE2 mice, overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor, exhibited 100% mortality by 10 days post infection. Regorafenib treatment significantly improved survival rates, approximately 43% remaining alive. Mechanistically, regorafenib effectively suppressed type I and II interferon and cytokine signaling. Notably, regorafenib inhibited NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, a key driver of the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of regorafenib and suggest its potential use as a promising treatment option for severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Systemic inflammation is associated with COVID-19 mortality rates, but the impact of inflammation on neutralizing antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on outcomes is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the association between neutralizing antibody responses, inflammation, and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Two hundred and eight patients presenting to the ED with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were included. Neutralization was assessed using the architect angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) binding inhibition assay, and inflammation was assessed using C reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Medical records were examined for 30-day mortality and 10-day intubation. Correlation between biomarkers was assessed and Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for outcomes. Thirty-seven (18%) patients died and 59 (28%) required intubation. There was a correlation between IL-6 and CRP (r = 0.34) but not ACE-2 (r < 0.06). Patients that died had higher CRP (14 mg/dl, 8-21) than those that survived (5 mg/dl, 2-11) and IL-6 (died = 344 pg/ml, 138-870 vs. survived = 65 pg/ml, 28-140). ACE-2 inhibition trended higher in those who survived (18%, 0%-65%) than those who died (3%, 0%-48%). Patients with elevated IL-6, elevated CRP, or low ACE2 inhibition had higher mortality. Only IL-6 (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% CI 1.08-1.52) and age (1.04, 1.01-1.08) were associated with mortality in multivariate models. Elevated IL-6 was associated with 30-day mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lower ACE-2 inhibition was not independently associated with mortality or correlated with inflammatory markers, implying the importance of other aspects of the immune response for reducing SARS-CoV-2 mortality risk.IMPORTANCEWhile systemic inflammation associated with worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not associated with neutralizing antibody concentrations, implying the importance of other aspects of the immune response for reducing SARS-CoV-2 mortality risk.">

        <tr id="The coinfection of individual cells is a requirement for exchange between two or more virus genomes, which is a major mechanism driving virus evolution. Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells are associated with viral clearance and improved outcomes in COVID-19, but also with immunopathology. Defining T cell diversity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables implementation of T cells in prevention and treatment strategies. T cells recognize peptide sequences from pathogens upon presentation in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Human MHC molecule diversity results in a wide array of peptide recognition by T cells making viral escape difficult, but also challenging to measure. Methods Using the ImmunoSEQ Assay to sequence complementarity-determining regions in the β chains (CDR3β) of the T cell receptor (TCR) from peripheral blood collected from participants in the EPICC COVID-19 cohort study, we quantified and characterized patterns of TCR usage. Multiple bioinformatic pipelines were compared for analysis. Results Our study evaluated TCR repertoires from 39 participants who had mild (20 outpatient) versus severe (19 hospitalized) acute COVID-19, and either experienced unvaccinated primary infection (n = 15) or vaccine breakthrough infection (n = 24) (Table 1). From these four clinical groups, we used the ImmuneCODE database, VDJdatabase and healthy controls to identify CD8 TCR sequences and amino acid motifs in the CDR3β region specific for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We were surprised to find that vaccine breakthrough and primary infection participants exhibited similar frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR sequences over 14-21 days post-symptom onset. Increased use of common TCR clones occurred in participants with older age and comorbidities, which correlated with more severe disease (Figure 1). Strikingly, an increased frequency of non-SARS-CoV-2 TCRs was significantly associated with severe disease in unvaccinated (p = 0.006) and vaccinated participants (p = 0.045). Conclusion In conclusion, our study highlights the opportunities and challenges of studying the complexity of T cell diversity and the utility of combining databases and bioinformatics for identification of patterns of TCR recognition. Interestingly, participants who were hospitalized were more likely to have circulating T cells non-specific for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that vaccines that increase T cell specificity may reduce disease severity.

This model exhibited a functional barrier over a 30-day period, evidenced by high transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). These findings were further validated by tight junctions’ confocal microscopy and low permeability to Lucifer yellow, confirming AlveolAir™ as robust platform for drug transport assays. Additionally, successful infections with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses were achieved, and antiviral treatments with Baloxavir and Remdesivir, respectively, effectively reduced viral replication. Interestingly, both viruses infected only the epithelial layer without replicating in endothelial cells. These findings indicate AlveolAir™ as a relevant model for assessing the toxicity and permeability of xenobiotics and evaluating the efficacy of novel antiviral therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The common cold coronaviruses are a source of ongoing morbidity and mortality particularly among elderly and immunocompromised individuals. While cross-reactive immune responses against multiple coronaviruses have been described following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination, it remains unclear if these confer any degree of cross-protection against the common cold coronaviruses. A recombinant fowl adenovirus vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (FAdV-9-S19) was generated, and protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge was shown in K18-hACE2 mice. Vaccinated mice were also challenged with the common cold coronaviruses human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 by the intranasal route, and viral shedding and lung burden were reduced in these groups compared to unvaccinated animals. Histopathological analysis of lung tissues revealed significantly less inflammation and lower pathology scores in mice that received FAdV-9-S19 . Because no mouse model for the coronavirus HCoV-229E exists, we vaccinated and challenged cynomolgus macaques to evaluate cross-protection against HCoV-229E. Animals were monitored for clinical signs of disease and viral shedding. Infectious virus was detected in both groups throughout the course of infection; however, vaccinated animals showed reduced viral shedding at multiple time points after infection. Histopathological analysis of lung tissues following challenge also indicated a more moderate disease in the vaccinated animals. Therefore, vaccination with FAdV-9-S19 also provided a moderate cross-protection against HCoV-229E disease in the cynomolgus macaques infection model. Our study demonstrates that vaccination with a recombinant fowl adenovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can provide a low-level cross-protection against beta- and alphacoronaviruses. These findings are important for the design of future pan-coronavirus vaccines. IMPORTANCE The common cold coronaviruses are a source of ongoing morbidity and mortality particularly among elderly and immunocompromised individuals, and no vaccine is currently available. Cross-reactive immune responses have been described following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination; however, it remains unclear what degree of cross-protection they confer against the common cold coronaviruses. We demonstrate that both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses provide a low-level cross-protection, resulting in reduced viral load and pathology for the common cold coronaviruses OC43 and NL63 in mouse models. Additionally, we present a novel non-human primate (NHP) model of infection with the common cold coronavirus 229E, demonstrating that it mimics the disease observed in humans and can serve as a model for future vaccine studies, as cross-protection was also observed. This is significant as it suggests that current vaccines could provide a low-level protection against other coronaviruses and could serve as part of vaccination strategy against future novel coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="The cuprizone (CPZ) model is widely used for modeling demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) and for testing potential remyelination therapies. We integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to fine map the spatial cellular and molecular responses during de and remyelination. ST revealed global demyelination and neuroinflammation in the brain beyond the corpus callosum, with region-specific differences. We identified oligodendroglia and microglia as two major cell types with significant transcriptomic changes in the model. Ligand receptor pairing analyses predicted growth factor and phagocytic pathway enrichment during demyelination, which is consistent with changes in MS lesions. During remyelination, while mature oligodendrocytes nearly reversed their phenotype back to the control state, microglia remained associated with the demyelination phenotype. Finally, astrocytes in the CPZ model had the greatest preservation of disease-associated modules to MS lesions, while the MOL, OPC, and microglia showed moderate to low preservation, which overall suggested that the CPZ model had moderate translatability to chronically active MS lesions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background People living with HIV (PLWH) face the dual challenge of human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is associated with severe outcomes and a higher risk of mortality. In January 2021, the vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 was launched in India and started mass administration of two types of vaccines. The two vaccines used on a large scale were, a recombinant, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine/ ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) and whole virion inactivated vaccine/ BBV152 (Covaxin).The study of cellular immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination in PLWH was vital for safeguarding this vulnerable population. Methods Study design: Prospective observational study Study population: The individuals recruited in the study were vaccinated with at least 2 doses and/or booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (COVISHIELD/COVAXIN). The individuals were segregated into two groups (PLWH and non-HIV-infected healthy individuals). Testing Method: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were cultured to test the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immune response using activation induced marker/ intracellular cytokine staining (AIM/ICS) assay. Distribution of CD4 T lymphocytes count in HIV patients with mean CD4 count 470 cell/µl. Results We conducted did this study in two phases. The first phase was conducted between August 2022 and December 2022, while the second phase, or the follow-up, took place from January 2023 to December 2023. In the first phase/ first visit (V1), we recruited 50 adult PLWH and 40 adult healthy controls. Subsequently, in phase 2/follow-up/ second visit (V2), we achieved a follow-up rate of 100% in each arm. SARS-CoV2-specific cellular immune response after COVID-19 vaccination was comparable and durable IN PLWH as compared to healthy controls. Conclusion Comparable and durable immune response was observed in PLWH population on regular highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with stable viral suppression and good CD4+ T cell counts. This was consistent over time across 1 year gap in both phases of the study and across different vaccine types. This outcome indicates that the cellular immune responses in our PLWH cohort is comparable and durable to that of the general population, which is a reassuring finding for the public health.

        <tr id="Cell cultures are widely used to study infectious respiratory diseases and to test therapeutics; however, they do not faithfully recapitulate the architecture and complexity of the human respiratory tract. Lung organoids have emerged as an alternative model that partially overcomes this key disadvantage. Lung organoids can be cultured in various formats that offer potential for studying highly pathogenic viruses. However, the effects of these different formats on virus infection remain unexplored, leaving their relative value unclear. In this study, we generated primary lung organoids from human donor cells and used them to derive monolayers and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with the goal of comparing the replication kinetics of two circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection studies revealed that organoid-derived monolayers displayed limited infection and the innate immune response was impaired against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not against virus-like double-stranded dsRNA or poly(I:C). Meanwhile, organoids and organoid-derived ALI cultures retained viral permissivity, with ALI cultures displaying diverse antiviral immune responses against both coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV demonstrated differential replication kinetics in organoid and organoid-derived ALI cultures. Therefore, primary organoid-derived cells in two-dimensional monolayer or three-dimensional ALI formats influence virus infection and host antiviral responses. Our study informs the selection of culture conditions for organoid-based respiratory disease research and therapeutic testing. Importance The COVID-19 pandemic heralded the upsurge in human-derived lung organoid based studies due to their cellular heterogeneity that emulates the cellular complexity of the respiratory tract. A major disadvantage of organoid models resides in their apical-in conformation that “hides” cells and proteins that are typically exposed to the air-liquid interface (ALI) in the airways and are targets of viruses. Here, we generated monolayers and ALI cultures to facilitate cell exposure to highly relevant pathogens and compared them to parental organoids. Organoids at the ALI captured infection and immune responses better than organoids and organoid-derived monolayer cultures. Organoids at the ALI are a viable approach to improve identification and characterization of virus infection, host responses, and therapeutic testing.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, profoundly impacted global health systems and economies. Vaccination and diagnostic advancements were pivotal in managing the pandemic. This systematic review evaluates antibody levels in adults following complete COVID-19 vaccination and examines the prevalence of infections in vaccinated populations. A systematic review adhering to PRISMA guidelines was conducted, focusing on studies analyzing antibody levels at least 14 days after full vaccination with FDA- or EMA-approved vaccines. Five European studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected. Data were extracted and synthesized from studies involving 6280 participants aged 19 to 105, with an average of 11% having prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Antibody levels were analyzed over time, and the incidence of post-vaccination COVID-19 cases was recorded. The reviewed studies demonstrated that antibody levels peaked shortly after vaccination but gradually declined over time. Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited higher antibody titers than those without prior exposure. After the first dose, the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine led to significantly higher antibody levels than the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, especially in those without prior infection. Across all studies, the incidence of COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals was low (0.1–3.8% for 144–302 days post-vaccination). Vaccination reduced severe outcomes despite decreasing antibody levels. The decline in new COVID-19 cases and related deaths is attributed to widespread vaccination, natural immunity, and virus mutations reducing severity. Further studies are warranted to explore antibody persistence and optimal vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and nearly 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system.Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 model. (A) Experimental diagram: Eight weeks-old K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, monitored daily for symptoms, or euthanized at 5 days post-infection (DPI) to collect tissue. (B) Daily weight measurements in K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020.

(D) Representative mouse brain hemisphere image showing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by immunohistochemical staining. Boxed regions are shown on the right. Bar: 500 µm. Methods Here using the K18-hACE2 model, we investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on major parts of neurovascular systems, and found increased incidence of microhemorrhage and significant disruption of both BBB and BCSFB in K18-hACE2 mice after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cerebral microvascular injury was accompanied by substantial pericyte damage, tight junction loss, astrogliosis, and neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma. In addition, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation occurred at both BBB and BCSFB, as shown by upregulation of VCAM-1 and COX2 markers.Figure 2: Vascular damage and BBB breakdown in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 model.

Results By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment.

        <tr id="The native microbiome influences a plethora of host processes, including neurological function. However, its impacts on diverse brain cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing on hippocampi from wildtype, germ-free mice and reveal the microbiome-dependent transcriptional landscape across all major neural cell types. We found conserved impacts on key adaptive immune and neurodegenerative transcriptional pathways, underscoring the microbiome’s contributions to disease-relevant processes. Mono-colonization with select indigenous microbes identified species-specific effects on the transcriptional state of brain myeloid cells. Colonization by Escherichia coli induced a distinct adaptive immune and neurogenerative disease-associated cell state, suggesting increased disease susceptibility. Indeed, E. coli exposure in the 5xFAD mouse model resulted in exacerbated cognitive decline and amyloid pathology, demonstrating its sufficiency to worsen Alzheimer’s disease-relevant outcomes. Together, these results emphasize the broad, species-specific, microbiome-dependent consequences on neurological transcriptional state and highlight the capacity of specific microbes to modulate disease susceptibility. Highlights The microbiome impacts the transcriptional landscape of all major brain cell types. Discrete microbes specifically modulate resident myeloid cell status.

        <tr id="Abstract Studying the molecular basis of intestinal infections caused by enteric pathogens at the tissue level is challenging, because most human intestinal infection models have limitations, and results obtained from animals may not reflect the human situation. Infections with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) have different outcomes between organisms. 3D tissue modeling of primary human material provides alternatives to animal experimentation, but epithelial co‐culture with immune cells remains difficult. Macrophages, for instance, contribute to the immunocompetence of native tissue, yet their incorporation into human epithelial tissue models is challenging. A 3D immunocompetent tissue model of the human small intestine based on decellularized submucosa enriched with monocyte‐derived macrophages (MDM) is established. The multicellular model recapitulated in vivo‐like cellular diversity, especially the induction of GP2 positive microfold (M) cells. Infection studies with STm reveal that the pathogen physically interacts with these M‐like cells. MDMs show trans‐epithelial migration and phagocytosed STm within the model and the levels of inflammatory cytokines are induced upon STm infection. Infected epithelial cells are shed into the supernatant, potentially reflecting an intracellular reservoir of invasion‐primed STm. Together, the 3D model of the human intestinal epithelium bears potential as an alternative to animals to identify human‐specific processes underlying enteric bacterial infections.">

        <tr id="The stability of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, especially concerning the cross-reactive recognition of the Omicron variant, remains incompletely characterized in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. This study evaluated humoral responses in 29 MM patients and cellular responses in a subset of 19 MM patients, specific to Wuhan and Omicron spike proteins, between 16 and 26 weeks following the third vaccine dose. After 26 weeks, we highlighted a significant reduction in the neutralizing antibodies to both spikes and the percentages of IFN-γ+CD107a+ spike-specific CD8+ T cells. On the other hand, patients who underwent an additional stimulation between the two time points, through either a fourth vaccine dose or breakthrough infection, showed a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies and stable levels of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Additionally, those with only three doses experienced a higher rate of breakthrough infections during the 32-week follow-up period. These findings underscore the waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time and may help benefit-risk evaluation in vaccination strategies in MM patients.">

However, the role of nsp1 in other host species remains elusive, especially in bats which are natural reservoirs of sarbecoviruses and possess a markedly different innate immune system than humans. Here, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 potently inhibits translation in bat cells from Rhinolophus lepidus, belonging to the same genus as known sarbecovirus reservoirs hosts. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 bound to the Rhinolophus lepidus 40S ribosome and show that it blocks the mRNA entry channel via targeting a highly conserved site among mammals. Accordingly, we found that nsp1 blocked protein translation in mammalian cell lines from several species, underscoring its broadly inhibitory activity and conserved role in numerous SARS-CoV-2 hosts. Our findings illuminate the arms race between coronaviruses and mammalian host immunity (including bats), providing a foundation for understanding the determinants of viral maintenance in bat hosts and spillovers.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is intricately related to the reprogramming of host metabolism. However, existing studies have mainly focused on peripheral blood samples and barely identified specific metabolites that are critically involved in the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current small-scale study, we performed metabolic profiling in plasma (n = 61) and paired bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples (n = 20) using parallel two-dimensional liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS). In addition, we studied how an identified metabolite regulates the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. The results unveiled distinct metabolome changes between healthy donors, and moderate and severe patients in both plasma and BALF, indicating that locations and disease severity play critical roles in COVID-19 metabolic alteration. Notably, a vital metabolite, indoxyl sulfate, was found to be elevated in both the plasma and BALF of severe COVID-19 patients. Indoxyl sulfate selectively induced TNF-α production, reduced co-stimulatory signals, and enhanced apoptosis in human monocytes. Moreover, its levels negatively correlated with the strength of co-stimulatory signals and antigen presentation capability in monocytes of COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that the levels of indoxyl sulfate could potentially serve as a functional biomarker to monitor COVID-19 disease progression and guide more individualized treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a profound global impact since its emergence in late 2019. Characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress and death, COVID-19 has necessitated extensive research into the host-pathogen interactions that drive disease progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies. This study employed a multi-omic approach that combined direct RNA sequencing (DRS) and Illumina cDNA sequencing to investigate whole blood transcriptomic profiles in COVID-19 patients. By leveraging the unique capabilities of Nanopore DRS, which provides long-read sequencing data, we were able to capture not only gene expression levels but also crucial RNA modifications, including poly(A) tail length, non-adenine residue (non-A), pseudouridylation (psU), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation. This comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore the impact of these RNA modifications on gene expression and function within the context of COVID-19. Our findings reveal significant alterations in gene expression patterns, poly(A) tail lengths, non-A and the prevalence of psU and m5C modifications in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. These results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between viral infection, host immune response, and RNA processing, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

Given the challenge of longitudinally sampling primary microglia, we optimized an in vitro method to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-human primates (NHP) into microglia-like cells (induced-microglia; iMGL). The iMGLs displayed transcriptional profiles distinct from those of monocyte progenitors and closely resembling those of primary microglia. Notably, morphological features showed that differentiated iMGLs derived from NHPs with chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) possessed a more mature-like microglial morphology. Additionally, dysregulation in key inflammatory and regulatory markers alongside increased baseline phagocytic activity was observed in CAC-derived IMGLs in the resting state. Phenotypic and functional assessments following LPS stimulation indicated the presence of an immune-tolerant phenotype and enrichment of a CD86+ hyper-inflammatory subpopulation in iMGLs derived from ethanol-exposed animals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vitro differentiation of PBMC offers a minimally invasive approach to studying the impact of CAC on microglial function revealing that CAC reshapes both functional and transcriptional profiles of microglia.">

However, the molecular mechanism behind SARS-CoV-2’s apoptotic activity remains unknown. Here, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a mediates the pulmonary pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is demonstrated by the fact that it causes lung tissue damage. The in vitro results showed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a triggers cell death via the disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis, which is modulated through the regulation of Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive Potassium Channel (MitoKATP). The addition of exogenous Potassium (K+) in the form of potassium chloride (KCl) attenuated mitochondrial apoptosis along with the inflammatory interferon response (IFN-β) triggered by SARS-ORF-3a. The addition of exogenous K+ strongly suggests that dysregulation of K+ ion channel function is the central mechanism underlying the mitochondrial dysfunction and stress response induced by SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a. Our results designate that targeting the potassium channel or its interactions with ORF-3a may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate the damaging effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic characterized by severe pneumonia. Brain structure abnormality has been confirmed in COVID-19 patients in the UK biobank [1]. However, it is not clear whether this abnormality is reversible nor if the abnormality could be detected in the early stage of the disease. Aims & Objectives In this study, the pathological effect of COVID-19 on the brain integrity was monitored through the utilization of a brain injury bioindicator, neurofilament light chain (NFL) [2]. It can be released from the brain into the peripheral blood when the brain neuronal axon is injured [3]. The study aimed to assess the correlation between the discharge diagnoses and NFL levels in COVID-infected patients. Method Plasma samples from the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) Biobank of 400 COVID-19 patients recruited from 24 hospitals across Taiwan were used for NFL analyses by immunoassay. Results Among the successfully analyzed 394 patients, 10 patients (2.5%) showed an NFL level above 200 pg/ml. The mean NFL levels were significantly higher in patients older than 50 years (P <0.0001). Male patients had a higher NFL level than females (P = 0.008). The increase in plasma levels of NFL was the highest in the first 1-7 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed, then gradually decreased within a month. Significant higher NFL levels were observed in patients with hospitalization, respiratory or ICU treatment, and oxygen therapy (P <0.0001). Moreover, higher NFL levels were also correlated with discharge diagnoses of cardiovascular, lung, kidney, and other chronic diseases (P ≦ 0.008). Discussion & Conclusion COVID-19 infection may cause brain neuronal injury especially in male patients older than 50 years. In addition, the plasma NFL level was associated with a number of clinical features. The results demonstrated that NFL could be an indicator for assessing the brain neuronal integrity following COVID- 19 infection.

        <tr id="In a subset of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals treated with the antiviral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the virus rebounds following treatment. The mechanisms driving this rebound are not well understood. We used a mathematical model to describe the longitudinal viral load dynamics of 51 individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, 20 of whom rebounded. Target cell preservation, either by a robust innate immune response or initiation of N-R near the time of symptom onset, coupled with incomplete viral clearance, appears to be the main factor leading to viral rebound. Moreover, the occurrence of viral rebound is likely influenced by the time of treatment initiation relative to the progression of the infection, with earlier treatments leading to a higher chance of rebound. A comparison with an untreated cohort suggests that early treatments with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be associated with a delay in the onset of an adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, our model demonstrates that extending the course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment to a 10-day regimen may greatly diminish the chance of rebound in people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. Altogether, our results suggest that in some individuals, a standard 5-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir starting around the time of symptom onset may not completely eliminate the virus. Thus, after treatment ends, the virus can rebound if an effective adaptive immune response has not fully developed. These findings on the role of target cell preservation and incomplete viral clearance also offer a possible explanation for viral rebounds following other antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2.


IMPORTANCE
Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. In a subset of individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the initial reduction in viral load is followed by viral rebound once treatment is stopped. We show that the timing of treatment initiation with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may influence the risk of viral rebound. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir stops viral growth and preserves target cells but may not lead to full clearance of the virus. Thus, once treatment ends, if an effective adaptive immune response has not adequately developed, the remaining virus can lead to rebound. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of rebound and can help develop better treatment strategies to minimize this possibility.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background COVID-19, which stands for Coronavirus Disease 2019, is caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and primarily manifests as a respiratory disease. However, the literature has reported its influence upon brain structure [1] and this observation finds additional support in the brain injury indicator, neurofilament light chain (NFL) [2]. Our NFL analysis in COVID-infected patients has indicated a correlation with the disease’ s severity. Nevertheless, the exact pathological pathway leading to brain neuronal injury remains elusive. Aims & Objectives In our prior analyses, we presented the findings on the NFL levels and their association with the syndrome observed in COVID-19-infected patients. In this study, we extended our investigation to include the examination of the oxidative stress indicator, D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) [3], in order to assess its correlation with NFL and its potential significance in COVID-infected patients. Method Plasma samples from 400 COVID-19 patients, drawn from 24 hospitals across Taiwan and sourced from the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) Biobank, were utilized for the analysis of DAO via immunoassay. The NFL data was incorporated from our previous investigation. Statistical analyses encompassed the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing two groups, Spearman's correlation analysis for assessing bivariate correlations. To address the distribution in plasma DAO and NFL levels, we applied log-transformation before subjecting them to the general linear model, with age and gender adjustment. Results Among the 391 COVID-infected patients analyzed, the average plasma DAO level was 136 ng/ml. Notably, the 10 patients exhibiting the most severe brain injury (NFL levels above 200 pg/ml) had a significantly higher average plasma DAO level of 568.2 ng/ml, in contrast to the group with less severe brain injury (NFL levels less than 200 pg.ml) composed of 381 patients, who had an average DAO level of 124.7 ng/ml (P=0.002). The DAO level displayed a significant correlation with the NFL level (Spearman’ s r=0.31, P<0.0001). Both the average NFL and DAO levels were significantly higher in patients over 50 years of age (P<0.0001, respectively), indicating a significant age-related trend. Male patients showed higher NFL and DAO levels than females (P=0.0002, and P<0.0001, respectively). The elevation in plasma NFL and DAO levels was most pronounced within the first 1-7 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed, subsequently declining over the course of a month. Additionally, the correlation between DAO and NFL levels became more pronounced in patients age 50 and above (Spearman’ s r=0.37, P=0.0001) compared to those under 50 years of age (Spearman’ s r=0.237, P<0.0001). Furthermore, the DAO level exhibited strong correlations with renal function indicators, specifically creatinine (Spearman’ s r=0.30, P=0.0002), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (Spearman’ s r=0.23, P=0.008). Discussion & Conclusion COVID-19 infection may lead to brain neuronal injury, particularly among male patients aged 50 and above. This neuronal injury exhibited a significant correlation with oxidative stress, as indicated by DAO. Furthermore, higher plasma DAO levels were associated with impaired kidney function, as indicated by elevated creatinine and BUN levels in clinical assessments. These results imply the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathological processes underlying brain neuronal injury.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, often leading to long-term kidney dysfunction. However, the transcriptomic features of AKI severity and its long-term effects are underexplored.


METHODS
We performed bulk RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and complemented these findings with proteomic data from the same cohort. We compared the functional enrichment findings with historical sepsis-AKI data and subsequently examined the association between molecular signatures and long-term kidney function changes.


RESULTS
In 283 patients, 57 had mild AKI (stage 1) and 49 had severe AKI (stage 2 or 3). Following adjustments for age, sex, severity of infection, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), we identified 6,432 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the severe AKI vs. control comparison, 840 in the mild AKI vs. control, and 1,213 in the severe vs. mild AKI comparison (FDR<0.05). Common pathways included unfolded protein response, cellular response to stress via eIF2, and IFN-g-mediated inflammatory response. Severe AKI was linked to pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Proteomic analysis confirmed 40 established AKI and inflammation biomarkers, while gene-set enrichment of transcription regulators revealed additional biomarkers for severe AKI. Comparison with PBMC transcriptomics from sepsis-related AKI showed significant functional overlap (30%). Analysis of post-discharge eGFR data in 115 patients identified 177 DEGs for severe vs. control, 106 for mild vs. control, and 46 for severe vs. mild AKI. Key associations included kidney function decline related to carbohydrate and mitochondrial metabolism, inflammatory-response, and cardiovascular regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate that severe AKI in SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. The functional overlap with sepsis-AKI suggests potential broader therapeutic applicability. Long-term kidney dysfunction is influenced by disruptions in cellular energy metabolism and immune response.">

        <tr id="Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss worldwide. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of thirteen human retina samples (from living and post-mortem donors) across non-diabetic, diabetic, and DR states to create a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas. We uncover three distinct microglial states—homeostatic, stress-response, and inflammatory—along a functional continuum, rather than discrete activation states, with dynamic transitions occurring throughout disease progression. Trajectory analysis indicates bifurcating paths starting from the homeostatic state branching toward stress-response and inflammatory states. Three major functional modules: ribosomal/translation, coordinated immune cell function, and inflammatory/transcriptional regulation, showing disease-specific activation patterns were identified. Cell communication analysis further highlights sophisticated neural-immune interactions, particularly between photoreceptors and microglia. Our findings provide insights into the complex cellular dynamics of DR progression and suggest potential therapeutic targets for early intervention.">

        <tr id="Exacerbated inflammation is a major contributor to tissue damage and mortality in infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. The resolution phase of inflammation is critical for restoring tissue homeostasis following an injury. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is a ubiquitous protein that plays a fundamental role in the resolution of inflammation, including in preclinical models of infectious disease. Here, we investigated the role of AnxA1 in coronavirus infection and its potential as a host-targeted therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2. Wild-type (WT) and AnxA1 knockout (AnxA1KO) mice were intranasally infected with the murine betacoronavirus MHV-3 to study the endogenous role of AnxA1. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses in the lungs of MHV-3-infected mice revealed increased AnxA1 expression and its cleavage, which was associated with neutrophilic infiltration (Ly6G+ cells) mainly in peribronchiolar and perivascular regions. AnxA1-deficient mice exhibited higher neutrophilic infiltration and lung damage, alongside increased CXCL1 production in the lungs, when compared to WT-infected mice. In a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice, we found increased AnxA1 cleavage associated with lung inflammation. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice with the AnxA1-mimetic peptide, Ac2-26, reduced lung damage and lethality, without altering the host ability to deal with viral replication. Notably, Ac2-26-treated mice exhibited similar levels of protection to that afforded by the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings highlight the protective role of the endogenous AnxA1 in mitigating coronavirus-induced lung inflammation and underscore the therapeutic potential of AnxA1 mimetic Ac2-26 as a host-targeted therapy against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the respiratory tract and lungs; however, the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can also involve the central nervous system. The pathomechanisms underlying neurological impairments in COVID-19 and post COVID-19 condition remain incompletely understood, hence experimental studies under defined conditions, in a suitable animal model, can help to clarify the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. The K18-hACE2 mouse represents such a model, as intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 VOC generally results in widespread neuronal infection with limited tissue response in the brain, consistent with a mild non-suppurative (meningo)encephalitis, with microgliosis, astrogliosis and (peri)vascular leukocyte infiltrates but no evidence of infection of vessel structures. The present study used this model to address the hypothesis that the vascular reaction is secondary to the neuronal infection. It confirmed that in intranasally challenged K18-hACE2 mice the virus targeted the neurons without overt neuropathic effect, whilst sparing the blood vessels, and further characterised the resulting inflammatory response in the brain in situ and through bulk RNA sequencing. The former highlighted the recruitment of leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes) via postcapillary venules, with their accumulation in the perivascular space and occasional emigration into the neuroparenchyma, without targeting and/or damage to the vessel wall. At the transcriptome level, this was accompanied by positive enrichment of pathways and the upregulation of genes involved in both the inflammatory reaction and the recruitment (including adhesion and migration) and activity of the leukocytes. We also found morphological and molecular evidence of subtle impairment of blood-brain barrier function, i.e. increased permeability. The results obtained from the model indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the neurons induces neuroinflammation, with leukocyte recruitment and activation as well as blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These data can help to understand more fully the reaction of the CNS in COVID-19 patients, and neurotropic virus infections in general.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the recognition of viral particles and activation of the innate immune system, but their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still poorly characterized. In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 10 (TLR10) in modulating the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results showed that overexpression of TLR10 in A549 lung epithelial cells, immunostimulated with SARS-CoV-2 proteins S and N mainly downregulated proinflammatory cytokines and interferons and affected gene expression in the cocultured THP-1 monocytes. Our results suggest that TLR10 could mediate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection by downregulating the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL10, IL6, IL8, and IFNβ. Modulation of TLR10 expression could have implications for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, in whom excessive inflammation leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a key feature. However, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of modulating TLR10 expression on the antiviral response and the overall balance of the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background/Aim Case reports describe prolonged COVID19 shedding in patients with malignant hematological disease. Similarly, we observed extended viral shedding in hemato-oncological patients (HP) at our SARS-CoV-2 unit. This raises the question of whether HP are more susceptible to prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and which aspects of immunosuppression contribute to this phenomenon. Patients and Methods Data from HP treated at a single center between 02/2022 and 02/2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Overall, 47 HP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were included. Additional data on 16 HP were retrieved from literature. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (t[SARS+]) was compared between subgroups with different diagnoses, immune status, and HP with and without medical treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Results t[SARS+] of HP was 47 days [interquartile range (IR)=25-95] and 12 HP (19%) were still positive by the end of the follow-up. In our cohort, four HP died while still shedding SARS-CoV-2 [t[SARS+]=47 days (IR=33.5-86)]. Different oncological diagnoses did not influence t[SARS+]. HP under steroids had a significantly longer average t[SARS+] (108 days vs. 45 days; p=0.016). HP with B cell depletion/T cell depletion and leukopenia were found to require more time to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 (pLogrank <0.05). Vaccinated HP had a significantly shorter duration of viral shedding (vaccinated 35.5 days vs. not vaccinated 86 days; pLogrank <0.01). Conclusion Prolonged viral shedding is a common occurrence in HP. Our data illustrate that HP under immune suppression show a significantly longer t[SARS+]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vaccination influences the length of viral shedding.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection disturbs the coagulation balance in the blood, triggering thrombosis and contributing to organ failure. The role of prothrombotic metabolites in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains elusive. Leveraging K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, we observed higher levels of the tryptophan metabolite, kynurenine, compared to controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed a significant upregulation of enzymes controlling Kynurenine biogenesis, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase levels in kidneys and liver, respectively, as well as changes in the enzymes involved in kynurenine catabolism, including kynurenine monooxygenase and kynurinase. Consistent with the agonistic role of these metabolites in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) signaling, AHR activation and its downstream mediator, tissue factor (TF), a highly potent procoagulant factor, was observed in endothelial cells (ECs) of lungs and kidneys of infected mice. These findings were validated in humans, where compared to controls, sera of COVID-19 patients showed increased levels of Kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid. Activation of the AHR-TF axis was noted in the kidneys and lungs of COVID-19 patients, and COVID-19 sera showed higher IDO-1 activity than controls. Levels of Kyn in COVID-19 patients correlated strongly with the TF-inducing activity of COVID-19 sera on ECs. A specific IDO-1 inhibitor or AHR inhibitor separately or in combination suppressed COVID-19 sera-induced TF activity in ECs. Together, we identified IDO-1 as upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in augmented Kyn and its prothrombotic catabolites, thereby suggesting the Kyn-AHR-TF axis as possibly a new diagnostic and/or therapeutic target. Key points SARS-CoV-2-infection upregulates kynurenine biogenesis in the liver and diminishes kynurenine catabolism in the lungs and kidneys. An increase in kynurenine stimulates the AHR-TF axis in the microvasculature in COVID-19 patients, which is inhibited by pharmacological manipulation.">

        <tr id="In recent times, a new viral origin, known as SARS COV-2, has been identified as responsible for the pandemic. SARS COV-2 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated mainly with breathing or respiratory problems. This review shows details about the virus and its components and transmission. The world is fighting and trying to develop a cure or vaccine against the virus. SARS-CoV-2 commonly presents itself with fever and pneumonia resulting in dyspnea, respiratory insufficiency and damage to the lung, resulting in morbidities and mortality. Besides the breathing system that is attacked by the virus, other organs and organic systems can suffer the inconvenience of the infection, such as, for example, the brain, gastrointestinal tract, renal system, hepatic system, hematological, cardiovascular and immune system. Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses found in a host of animals and humans, which belong to the family Coronaviridae and subfamily Coronavirinae, the order of the nucleoside sequences. Though rare, CoVs can mutate and cross animal-wildlife barriers, returning to perpetuate the public health crisis. It is a large virus with a genome size of about 30 kb. The genome has 14 open reading frames, with the four major structural proteins: the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins at the 3 end of the genome. It is the S protein, through the receptor binding domain, that is essential for binding to the ACE2 receptor and its priming by transmembrane serine protease 2 allows the virus to enter the host cell through membrane fusion with the host cell membrane.">

 Background:
 Preceding respiratory tract infections (RTIs) caused by bacteria or viruses are associated with worse stroke outcomes, likely due to an exaggerated inflammatory immune response, endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and coagulopathy. Recent studies have revealed increased plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels and reduced ADAMTS13 activity (the risk factors for stroke) in patients with RTIs, including COVID-19. However, it remains unclear whether an imbalance in the VWF–ADAMTS13 axis plays a causative role in the pathophysiology of
 S. aureus
 - or COVID-19-associated stroke severity or is merely an associative marker of disease status.


 Objective:
 To examine whether an imbalance in the VWF–ADAMTS13 axis is a causal link between RTIs and stroke severity.


 Methods:
 Wild-type (WT) mice (3–4 months old) were infected intranasally with sublethal doses of
 S. aureus
 (on days 0, 2, and 5) or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (on day 0). On day 6 (
 S. aureus
 ) or day 3 (SARS-CoV-2), the infection was confirmed to be localized in the lungs (but not in the brain) and the plasma VWF levels and ADTMTS13 activity were quantified. In another set of experiments, WT,
 Vwf
 −/−
 , and
 Adamts13
 −/−
 mice (3–4 months old) with respective littermate controls were subjected to transient (30 or 45 min) cerebral ischemia (filament stroke model) followed by reperfusion. For the
 S. aureus
 experiments, brain infarcts were assessed on day 2 post-reperfusion and functional outcomes (corner test, wire hanging test, modified neurological severity score, and rotarod test) on week 1 and 4 post-reperfusion. For the SARS-CoV-2 experiments, brain infarcts and functional outcomes (the Bederson score) were assessed on day 1 post-reperfusion.


 Result:
 We demonstrated that
 S. aureus
 or SARS-CoV-2 infection localized to the lungs in the WT mice resulted in increased (2–3 fold) plasma VWF levels and reduced ADAMTS13 activity, concomitant with larger infarcts and worse functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. mock-infected mice) up to day 28 post-reperfusion.
 S. aureus
 - or SARS-CoV-2-infected VWF-deficient mice exhibited reduced infarcts and improved functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. infected

 Vwf
 +/+

 ). In contrast,
 S. aureus
 or SARS-CoV-2-infected ADAMTS13-deficient mice displayed greater stroke severity (P<0.05 vs. infected

 Adamts13
 +/+

 ).


 Conclusion:
 In the experimental models of RTI preceding stroke, VWF plays a causal role in worsening stroke outcomes, while ADAMTS13 is protective.

        <tr id="Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis strongly correlates with neuroinflammation. Peripheral monocytes are crucial components of the human immune system that may play a role in neuroinflammation, but their contribution to AD pathogenesis is largely understudied partially due to the lack of appropriate human models. Here, we present human cortical organoid microphysiological systems (hCO-MPSs) for modeling dynamic AD neuroinflammation mediated by monocytes. By incorporating 3D printed devices into an existing cortical organoid protocol, 96 hCO-MPSs can be established with significantly reduced necrosis and hypoxia as well as enhanced viability within a commonly used 96 well plate, and each hCO-MPS consists of a doughnut-shaped hCO and a 3D printed device per well. Using this approach, monocytes from AD patients exhibit higher infiltration, decreased amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance, and stronger inflammatory responses compared to monocytes from age-matched control donors. Moreover, pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptosis were observed to be induced by AD monocytes. Furthermore, the significant increase in the expression of IL1B and CCL3, both at the transcriptional and protein levels, indicated the pivotal role of these cytokine and chemokine in monocyte-mediated AD neuroinflammation. Our findings provide insight for understanding monocytes’ role in AD pathogenesis, and the user-friendly MPS models we present are compatible with existing laboratory settings, highlighting their potential for modeling neuroinflammation and developing new therapeutics for various neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to an emerging health challenge known as long COVID, also known as PASC, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, characterized by symptoms that persist beyond the acute phase of infection. While acute COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique patterns of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Enteroviruses cause nearly 1 billion global infections annually and are associated with a diverse array of human illnesses. Among these, myocarditis and the resulting chronic inflammation have been recognized as major contributing factors to virus-induced heart failure. Despite our growing understanding, very limited therapeutic strategies have been developed to address the pathological consequences of virus-induced chronic innate immune activation. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was used as a model cardiotropic enterovirus. We leveraged in vitro cell-based studies to investigate cardiomyocyte and macrophage interaction during CVB3 infection, as well as animal studies and unique human cardio specimens to evaluate mechanisms of viral heart injury. We present evidence that viral myocarditis is in part exacerbated by pathological activation of the complement pathway in cells, mice, and human cardiac tissues. We demonstrate unique cell type-specific responses to viral infection that are exacerbated by mitochondrial injury in cardiomyocytes and NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in macrophages. Macrophages are robustly activated by damage-associated mitochondrial components, including mitochondrial proteins and lipid extracts. Mechanistically, we identify complement protective factors CD59/protectin and CD55/DAF as novel targets of viral proteinase that acts to release the brakes on complement-mediated autoinjury. Collectively, our study highlights a novel mechanism that can act as a potential contributor to CVB3 pathogenesis through mitochondrial injury-mediated autoimmunity. IMPORTANCE This study sheds light on how enteroviruses, specifically coxsackievirus B3, may contribute to heart failure by triggering harmful immune responses in the heart. We discovered that viral infections in heart cells cause mitochondrial damage, which in turn activates a destructive immune response involving the complement system. This immune activation is one of the significant contributors that lead to further injury of heart tissues, worsening the damage caused by the virus. Additionally, we identified key protective molecules that are targeted and disrupted by the virus, allowing the immune system to attack the heart even more aggressively. Understanding these mechanisms may provide additional insights into how viral infections can lead to chronic heart conditions and suggests potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reduce heart damage in patients affected by viral myocarditis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background COVID‐19 has been associated with both respiratory (diaphragm) and non‐respiratory (limb) muscle atrophy. It is unclear if SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of skeletal muscle plays a role in these changes. This study sought to: 1) determine if cells comprising skeletal muscle tissue, particularly myofibres, express the molecular components required for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; 2) assess the capacity for direct SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and its impact on atrophy pathway genes in myogenic cells; and 3) in an animal model of COVID‐19, examine the relationship between viral infection of skeletal muscle and myofibre atrophy within the diaphragm and limb muscles. Methods We used in silico bioinformatics analysis of published human single cell RNA‐seq datasets, as well as direct qPCR examination of human myotubes and diaphragm biopsies, to assess expression of key genes involved in SARS‐CoV‐2 cellular entry. In Vitro, we determined the ability of SARS‐CoV‐2 to directly infect myogenic cells and employed qPCR to assess the impact on muscle atrophy pathway genes (ubiquitin‐proteasome, autophagy). In vivo, the diaphragm and quadriceps of Roborovski hamsters with SARS‐CoV‐2 respiratory infection were examined at day 3 post‐inoculation to evaluate the relationship between atrophy pathway and SARS‐CoV‐2 transcripts by qPCR, as well as histological measurements of myofibre morphology. Results Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as cooperating proteases (furin, cathepsins B and L), are expressed by myofibres. ACE2 expression was increased 5‐fold (p = 0.01) in the diaphragms of mechanically ventilated human subjects compared to controls. In Vitro, a time‐dependent increase of SARS‐CoV‐2 transcript levels was observed in myotubes directly exposed to the virus (p = 0.002). This was associated with downregulation of the ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 (by 64%, p = 0.002) and the autophagy gene LC3B (by 31%, p = 0.009). In contrast, in vivo infection led to upregulation of MuRF1 in quadriceps (23‐fold, p = 0.0007) and autophagy genes in both quadriceps (5.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 7‐fold for p62, p = 0.0002) and diaphragm (2.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 2.3‐fold for p62, p = 0.057). In infected hamsters the diaphragm lacked viral transcripts but exhibited atrophy (48% decrease in myofibre area; p = 0.02), whereas the quadriceps lacked myofibre atrophy despite elevated viral transcripts in the muscle. Conclusions Although myogenic cells express the genes required for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and can be directly infected, there was no evident relationship between viral transcript levels and manifestations of atrophy, either in vitro or in vivo. Our results do not support direct myofibre infection by SARS‐CoV‐2 as a likely cause of atrophy in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background: This study assessed the long-term dynamics of neutralizing antibodies in a Ugandan cohort primarily exposed to the A.23.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant, examining how this shaped immune breadth and potency against diverse strains following infection and prototype-based vaccination. Methods: We conducted a 427-day retrospective analysis of 41 participants across multiple SARS-CoV-2 waves, assessing binding and neutralizing antibody responses using in-house ELISA and pseudotyped virus neutralization assays. We quantified immune responses to key SARS-CoV-2 variants, A.23.1, D614G, Delta, and BA.4, capturing evolving immunity across the pandemic. Results: Neutralizing antibody titers against A.23.1 remained significantly higher than those against D614G, Delta, and BA.4, highlighting the solid immune memory following A.23.1 infection. Consistently lower titers were observed for BA.4 across all time points, aligning with its strong immune-evasion capability. Correlations between neutralizing titers and spike-directed IgG (S-IgG) concentrations were significantly stronger for A.23.1 than for D614G, with no correlation for BA.4. ChAdOx1-S vaccination substantially elevated the neutralizing titers across all variants, most notably BA.4, highlighting the essential role of vaccination in boosting immunity, even in individuals with initially low titers. Conclusions: Initial exposure to the A.23.1 variant triggered potent immune responses, shaping neutralizing antibody dynamics during subsequent exposures. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for early viral exposures in vaccine development and public health planning. The distinctly lower immune response to BA.4 highlights the need for continuous antigenic monitoring and timely vaccine updates for protection against emerging variants. Vaccination remains essential for reinforcing and sustaining immunity against evolving variants.">

        <tr id="T-cell-mediated immunity is essential for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) infection, preventing severe disease, and potentially reducing the risk of long-term coronavirus disease (COVID). This study investigated the impact of natural infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity on T-cell responses, with a particular emphasis on the role of memory T-cells in long-term COVID-19. The present study reviewed current literature on T-cell responses, including memory T-cell development, in individuals with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, those vaccinated with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, and those with hybrid immunity. It examined studies that compared T-cell activity, immune regulation, and the prevalence of long-term COVID-19 across these groups. Natural infection induces variable T-cell responses, with severe cases showing stronger but sometimes dysregulated immunological activity, which may contribute to prolonged COVID-19. Vaccination, particularly with mRNA vaccines, elicits targeted and consistent T-cell responses, including memory T-cells, reducing disease severity, and the incidence of long-term COVID-19. Hybrid immunity combines natural infection and vaccination, provides the most robust protection, enhanceds memory T-cell responses, and reduces the risk of long-term COVID-19 through balanced immune regulation. Memory T-cells play a critical role in mitigating long-term COVID-19. Vaccination significantly enhances T-cell-mediated immunity, minimizing the risk of chronic symptoms compared to natural infection alone. Hybrid immunity provides the most effective defense, emphasizing the importance of vaccination, even after natural infection, to prevent long-term COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential players in the immune response to infections, involved in shaping innate and adaptive immunity. However, a complete understanding of their specific roles in respiratory infections, including SARS‐CoV‐2, remains elusive. Methods To investigate the dynamics of monocytes and DCs in blood as well as the upper and lower airways, we sampled 147 patients with varying degree of COVID‐19 severity longitudinally during the spring of 2020. Results Using flow cytometry, proteomics and in vitro TLR stimulation, we found differences in the distribution and function of monocytes and DCs in patients compared with controls, and importantly, reduced levels of DCs in both blood and airways. In fact, lower frequencies of cDC2s (Lin− HLA‐DR+ CD1c+) early after symptom onset predicted subsequent severe disease, and depletion of DC subsets lasted longer in patients with more severe disease. In contrast, severe COVID‐19 was associated with increased frequencies of activated monocytes in the lower, but not the upper, airways. Proteomic analysis showed that monocyte and DC‐related cytokines in plasma and airways associated with disease severity. During convalescence, cell frequencies and responses to TLR ligands normalised in blood, except for persistently low plasmacytoid DCs. Conclusion Our study reveals a distinct pattern of recruitment of monocytes but not DCs to the airways during severe COVID‐19. Instead, decreased levels of DCs in both blood and airways were found, possibly contributing to more severe COVID‐19. The connection between low blood DCs early in disease course and more severe outcomes provides insight into COVID‐19 immunopathology, with possible therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="Introduction Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality, especially in COVID-19 patients, due to delayed diagnosis and limited therapeutic options. While the mechanisms of programmed cell death (PCD) in COVID-19 and sepsis are complex, understanding the molecular markers involved in these processes may aid in assessing disease severity. This study aimed to investigate the roles of PCD markers, inflammatory cytokines, and MHC molecules in distinguishing disease severity in COVID-19 patients with and without sepsis. Methods The study involved adult patients (≥18 years) who survived COVID-19, grouped into four cohorts: COVID-19 with sepsis (C19wSepsis), COVID-19 without sepsis (C19NoSepsis), sepsis alone, and healthy controls. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each cohort were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. PCD markers (caspase-3, caspase-1, MLKL, LC3B, p62/SQSTM1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma), and MHC molecules (MHC I-A, MHC II-DRB1) were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate differences in marker levels between and within cohorts. Results The analysis identified two distinct molecular signatures associated with disease severity. The first signature, characterized by elevated levels of secreted markers of PCD, IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma, MHC I-A and MHC II-DRB1, was common to the C19wSepsis and C19NoSepsis cohorts. The second signature, which was more prominent in the cellular markers of PCD (caspase-1, caspase-3, MLKL, p62/SQSTM1), was uniquely associated with the C19wSepsis cohort. Conclusion These findings provide insight into the molecular signatures distinguishing immune responses in COVID-19-related sepsis and may serve as valuable biomarkers for assessing disease severity, while guiding therapeutic interventions in critical care settings.">

        <tr id="Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased severity and mortality from respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination in the general population significantly reduces the risk of severe respiratory viral infection and triggers a strong, polyfunctional and lasting T cell response in healthy individuals. However, vaccine effectiveness in people with diabetes is unclear. Here we studied the magnitude and functional characteristics of vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the full vaccination protocol, and the recall response after a third booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and compared them to those of people without diabetes. We found defects in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory maintenance and the functionality of the vaccine specific T cells in people with diabetes compared to people without. In those individuals with diabetes that harbored detectable vaccine-specific T cells, they displayed an unfocused, tolerogenic phenotype characterized by increased expression of IL-13 and IL-10 in T1D and T2D compared to people without diabetes. These results have implications for vaccination strategies for people with diabetes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT MAIT cells are one of the largest unconventional T cell populations and, recruited to the site of infection, play both protective and pathogenic roles during pulmonary viral infections. MAIT cell activation patterns change significantly during COVID‐19, with a notable decrease in their frequency in peripheral blood of severe cases. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiles of various immune checkpoint pathways on MAIT, MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells in moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients undergoing cytokine storm. Despite numerous studies comparing MAIT cell characteristics based on COVID‐19 disease severity, none have delved into the critical differences in MAIT cell immune checkpoint profiles between moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients, all experiencing a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry was used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 35 patients, comprising 18 moderate and 17 severe cases, alongside 14 healthy controls. Our investigation specifically focuses on severe COVID‐19 presentations, revealing a marked deletion of MAIT cells. Further exploration into the regulatory dynamics of MAIT cell functionality reveals shifts in the expression profiles of critical immune checkpoint receptors, notably PD‐1 and CD226. In severe COVID‐19 patients, MAIT cells showed a significant decrease in the expression of CD226, whereas MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of PD‐1 compared to healthy individuals. The expression of the TIGIT receptor remained unaltered across all investigated groups. Our findings contribute to the existing knowledge by elucidating the changes in MAIT cell subpopulations and their potential role in COVID‐19 disease severity.">

Recent studies have reported that severe cases of COVID-19 are primarily characterized
by endotheliitis (or endothelialitis), whose severity is related to the pre-existing or current damage to
the complex structure that lines the surface of the vascular endothelium, most notably the glycocalyx.
Such damage results in the loss of many endothelial cell functions. To restore these functions, the
cell must repair the glycocalyx that covers it. However, this is not always possible, especially when
the repair capacity of such an exo-endo-cytoplasmic cell structure is limited due to cellular senescence.
If the gene repair system remains activated, the damaged glycocalyx can be reconstituted via
specific transcriptional pathways in response to oxidative and reductive stresses. Despite the experimental
evidence in favour of this hypothesis, many of the recently published reviewrs on long
COVID do not mention the use of therapeutic treatments via specific 'oxidative eustress'. In fact,
mild and controlled oxidative stress is able to induce an activating response to cellular damage repair
processes. This perspective aims to draw the attention of researchers to these aspects in an attempt to
address this gap in understanding.

        <tr id="Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of pathophysiological conditions linked to the disruption of metabolic processes associated with energy storage and consumption. Approximately one-third of adults in the United States are currently diagnosed with MetS. Patients with MetS experience higher mortality rates following SARS-CoV-2 infection and exhibit poor vaccine efficacy following influenza virus vaccination compared to metabolically healthy individuals. However, the specific impact of MetS on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination has not been widely studied. To address this gap, we utilized high-fat diet feeding to establish a murine model of MetS, in which mice exhibit the same diagnostic criteria for MetS as human patients. We then used high-fat diet-induced MetS mice and regular chow diet-fed wild-type mice to analyze immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we monitored mice for disease severity, measured levels of virally induced inflammation, and quantified viral titers in various tissues. Our results indicate that MetS mice exhibit accelerated mortality post-infection, accompanied by elevated mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokine transcripts at sites of infection. Additionally, MetS alters the degree of viral replication across various tissues. Furthermore, our vaccination studies revealed that MetS reduces the potency of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Delta variant. Overall, our findings suggest that MetS exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and diminishes vaccine efficacy, underscoring the need for tailored strategies to protect individuals with MetS from severe outcomes following infection and vaccination. Impact This study represents the first detailed account of the failure to generate protective neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mice with metabolic syndrome (MetS) following vaccination. The insights gained from this research inform future vaccine design and aid in identifying individuals at greater risk of breakthrough infections. By specifically isolating the risk associated with MetS, rather than obesity alone, these findings lay the groundwork for future investigations aimed at enhancing immune responses in individuals with MetS. This work is highly relevant to a broad audience, as it addresses a critical unmet need in vaccine development and provides essential guidance for the rational design of vaccines to protect vulnerable populations affected by MetS.">

        <tr id="The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it critical to understand the immune and inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It became increasingly recognized that the immune response was a key mediator of illness severity and that its mechanisms needed to be better understood. Early infection of both tissue and immune cells, such as macrophages, leading to pyroptosis-mediated inflammasome production in an organ system critical for systemic oxygenation likely plays a central role in the morbidity wrought by SARS-CoV-2. Delayed transcription of Type I and Type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to early disinhibition of viral replication. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), some of which may be produced through mechanisms involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), likely contribute to the hyperinflammatory state in patients with severe COVID-19. Lymphopenia, more apparent among natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells, can contribute to disease severity and may reflect direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 or end-organ sequestration. Direct infection and immune activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may be a critical mechanism through which end-organ systems are impacted. In this context, endovascular neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and microthrombi development can be seen in the lungs and other critical organs throughout the body, such as the heart, gut, and brain. The kidney may be among the most impacted extrapulmonary organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to a high concentration of ACE2 and exposure to systemic SARS-CoV-2. In the kidney, acute tubular injury, early myofibroblast activation, and collapsing glomerulopathy in select populations likely account for COVID-19-related AKI and CKD development. The development of COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), in particular, may be mediated through IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suggesting a direct connection between the COVID-19-related immune response and the development of chronic disease. Chronic manifestations of COVID-19 also include systemic conditions like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which may reflect a spectrum of clinical presentations of persistent immune dysregulation. The lessons learned and those undergoing continued study likely have broad implications for understanding viral infections’ immunologic and inflammatory consequences beyond coronaviruses.">

Coronavirus (COVID-19) is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), and the exaggerated immune response resulting from infection with this disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality.  Activation may have a contribution to disease severity.A case study was carried out in order to find the association between COVID-19, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2. The effect of age, sex, smoking, diabetic and hypertention on the level of the studied cytokines were evaluated. Inaddition, the influnce of COVID-19 severity on TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2 levels were studied. Blood samples were collected from 50 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who visited of Al-Hussein Teaching hospital and 50 control people, during the period from (May -November 2021). The ages of the patients ranged from (Twenty two years to seventy six years). The serum samples were used in detection of TNF-α , IL-8 and IL-2  by using ELISA test. Then   the collected data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 11. The results showed that that the most affected age group was (40-60) years old followed by less than 40 years old and more than 60 years old. The numbers of patients were 29, 11 and 10 respectively. Most of COVID-19 patients were male (56 %:28), while the rest cases were females (44%:22). The mean values of the studied cytokines in COVID-19 patients in both sex and all age groups were more than their counter parters in H.C group. The effect of main risk factors for severe and long COVID-19 include age, sex, smoking, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension) on variations in the level of studied cytokines of the host were found significantly. Moreover, the effect of COVID-19 severity on the studied cytokines was highly significants. The maximum values of cytokines were obtaind in critical degree followed by severe and moderate severity.  It is concluded from the study's results that patients infected with severe SARS-CoV-2 experience increasing proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 that produce signaling the initial phase of cytokine storm. Thus, further studies should be conducted to use the studied cytokines inhibitors as a treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

Currently available in vitro models mainly recapitulate the viral life cycle per se, but fail to model immune cell-mediated pathogenesis.

We test the infections of two RNA viruses, hepatitis E virus (HEV) and SARS-CoV-2, and one DNA virus, monkeypox virus (MPXV), which either primarily or secondarily affect the human liver. In all three viral disease modalities, MaugOs recapitulate both infection and the resulting inflammatory response, albert to different levels. Intriguingly, this system showcases the ability to dissect the multifunctional role of human bile on HEV replication and inflammatory response through distinct mechanisms of action. MaugOs especially when integrated with pro-inflammatory macrophages recapitulate a prominent feature of inflammatory cell death triggered by HEV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept in MaugOs to develop multitarget therapeutic strategies that simultaneously target the virus, inflammatory response, and the resultant inflammatory cell death.">

Mouse models are still one of the most-interrogated experimental systems with the caveat of biological differences in pathogen-host-interaction for some human-relevant pathogens and increasing ethical concerns. Arguably one of the most complex cell culture models are precision cut organ slices, volume defined tissue blocks which can be cultured ex vivo and exposed to various stimuli including human pathogens. They could be applied as 3R model system. However, their response to infectious agents in comparison to in vivo models is understudied. To understand species and model specific differences in the host response (here: influenza A virus (IAV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn)), we interrogate here the transcriptional reaction of human PCLS (hPCLS) compared to that of murine precision cut lung slices (mPCLS) and a murine in vivo infection model. A direct comparison of hPCLS and mPCLS revealed a more complex early innate immune response against viral and bacterial pathogens in the human model, which beyond this informs about secondary cell-to-cell communication in situ and bystander cell responses to proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines secreted by tissue resident immune cells. In contrast, the murine PCLS model revealed substantial deficits in responding to viral challenge, reproducing only a small fraction of the murine in vivo host response. Our study provides the first cross-species comparison of early transcriptomic responses to relevant human pathogens.">

        <tr id="HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) cause significant dysfunction among people living with HIV. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system and are readily infected by HIV. Microglia are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HAND. In order to identify pathways that may contribute to neuropathogenesis in HAND, we infected induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) with HIV and defined gene expression changes over an 8-day period. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were studied in parallel in order to identify common pathways stimulated in myeloid cells versus the unique aspects of microglia infection. Infection of iMG led to the induction of a robust early inflammatory response triggered within hours of infection, a pattern that differed significantly from that seen in MDMs. Remarkably, gene expression changes in iMG reproduced many of the characteristic genetic signatures previously identified in brain tissues obtained from individuals clinically diagnosed with HAND. Inflammatory activation representing interferon-mediated signaling, TNF/NF-κB, and IL-6/JAK/STAT pathways were particularly prominent over the time course of infection. Interferon-mediated signaling led to enhanced expression of multiple HIV restriction factors, yet viral replication in iMG remained robust. These findings suggest that HIV infection of microglia is the key cellular driver of neuroinflammation in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals. Further studies of infected microglia are likely to aid in understanding the pathogenesis of HAND and in evaluating therapeutic strategies to limit or eliminate HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. Author Summary Persons living with HIV frequently develop debilitating problems with brain function that are collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Treatment with antiretroviral drugs to control HIV has largely eliminated the most severe form of HIV-related brain dysfunction, HIV encephalitis, but a significant proportion of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiviral therapy still develop significant problems with cognitive function. Microglia are the major macrophage-like cells of the brain and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Inflammation in the brain following infection contributes to damage to neurons and is the likely source of decline of brain function. This study used microglia that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, termed iMG, to study the kinetics of gene expression changes in HIV-infected microglia, and compared those changes to those seen in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). iMG were found to be easily infected with a macrophage-tropic HIV strain and exhibited a rapid increase in gene expression associated with inflammatory signaling through interferon- and tumor necrosis factor/NF-kappa B-mediated pathways. Remarkably, the patterns of gene expression in microglia strongly overlapped with gene expression signatures derived from brain tissue samples of HIV patients with HAND. The rapid onset and magnitude of inflammation as well as induction of specific HIV restriction factors differed from that seen in infected macrophages/MDMs. These studies reinforce the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of HAND and provide insights into HIV-microglia interactions that can help direct interventions to reduce inflammation and preserve brain function.">

        <tr id="Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe condition often seen in intensive care unit patients. Due to limited treatment options, ALI is linked to high rates of mortality and morbidity. Bacterial and viral infections are significant contributors to ALI. For instance, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to a strong inflammatory response that may progress to ALI, a leading cause of death in COVID-19 cases. Prior research has demonstrated that sulfonamides and sydnones exhibit anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, which has led us to develop compounds containing both scaffolds. Most of the new sulfonamide-sydnone hybrids are expected to be orally bioavailable based on in silico ADME predictions. They effectively suppressed the development of ALI in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice and inhibited viral replication in Calu-3 cells, with minimal cytotoxicity in non-infected Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells. Molecular docking investigations indicated some possible viral targets for the action of the sydnones, highlighting the possible interaction with non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, combined experimental and theoretical studies indicated that the new compounds can strongly interact with human serum albumin, suggesting a possible extended residence time in the human bloodstream.">

Immunomodulatory drugs have shown success in dampening the deleterious inflammatory response seen in severe COVID-19 patients, but there remains an urgent need for development of additional therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. A potential drug target is the CCR5-CCL5 axis, and blocking this pathway may protect against severe disease. Here we evaluated whether OB-002, an analog of human CCL5 and a potent antagonist of CCR5, provides therapeutic benefit in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. Daily treatment with OB-002 altered immune gene transcription in the lungs, and reduced pathology following infection, but did not prevent weight loss or viral replication in the lungs of infected animals, even in combination with the antiviral drug remdesivir. Our data suggest that targeting the CCR5-CCL5 pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters is insufficient to significantly impact disease development in this model.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal effects, but its impact on infant’s immune development is not well defined. Using transcriptional profiles we analyzed the impact of SARS-CoV2 infection and/or vaccination in pregnant people and their infants longitudinally Transcriptome changes in pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination Modular analysis of pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination compared with healthy uninfected controls. Red dot: overexpression, blue dot: underexpression, white/empty space no difference vs controls Methods Multicenter observational study of SARS-CoV-2-infected and/or vaccinated pregnant people and their infants. Pregnant people (infected [n=91], vaccinated [n=42], infected-and-vaccinated [n=14], controls [n=22]) and their infants (n=81, 38,14, 11, respectively) were included. Maternal blood samples were collected during different trimesters and at delivery. Infant blood samples were collected longitudinally from birth (< 72 hours), at 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months of age. Whole blood RNA was extracted for RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic data analyzed with R Transcriptional analysis of immune system development in early life Modular gene expression scores were analyzed longitudinally of individual infant samples. Red: higher expression, white: lower expression. D1-3: days 1 to 3, W1: week 1, M1: month 1, M3: month 3, M6: month 6 Results Compared with uninfected controls, interferon and plasma cells genes were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute infection (< 14 days), but underexpressed with earlier infection or vaccination during pregnancy (Figure 1). Newborns < 72 h of age (from all groups) showed significantly increased expression of erythrocytes, neutrophils, and inflammation genes. Expression of T/cytotoxic cell genes started to be observed at 1 week, while expression of B cells, plasma cells and interferon genes was observed at 3 months of age (Figure 2). Quantitative gene set enrichment analysis showed that compared to controls, infants from infected and/or vaccinated mothers had increased expression of interferon, while neutrophil, and adaptive immunity genes were decreased (Figure 3) SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination of pregnant people shaped immune profiles of their infants Fold changes of gene sets in infants compared to controls are shown (adjusted p-value <0.01) from quantitative gene set enrichment (QuSAGE) analysis. Red: overexpression, blue: underexpression. Infant groups are defined by maternal infection and/or vaccination status at delivery. Conclusion Interferon and plasma cells related pathways were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute COVID-19, while vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection earlier in pregnancy were associated with under-expression of both innate and adaptive immunity genes. The infant immune system changed rapidly in the first few days of life, as different immune programs followed separate time trajectories.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019, was caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a shell virus containing a single positive chain genome and using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The targeting of SARS-CoV-2 on several tissues expressing ACE2 explains the multifactorial pattern of symptoms: fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue and shortness of breath. These symptoms do not always stop after COVID-19, and symptoms may reappear within 12 weeks, which indicates the development of post-COVID syndrome (long COVID). Due to the extensive symptoms and comorbidity of patients, the clinical diagnosis of post-COVID syndrome is difficult. The aim of the study is to identify pathognomonic indices of biochemical blood analysis in convalescents, indicating the development of post-COVID syndrome. 
Patients and study design: a retrospective observational one-moment study of 373 case histories and outpatient records was conducted for the patients exposed to COVID-19 not later than 12 weeks ago. The initial course of the disease (disease) was assessed using the WHO Clinical Progression Scale. The severity of post-COVID syndrome (clinical outcomes) was assessed on the functional status scale after COVID-19 (PCFS). All subjects are divided into four groups, the names of which reflect the severity of COVID-19 and the severity of the post-ovoid condition: 1st group, “mild COVID-19 / 0-2 PCFS class”; 2nd group, “mild COVID-19 / 3-4 PCFS class”; 3rd group, “medium and severe COVID-19 / 0-2 PCFS class”; 4th group, “medium and severe COVID-19 / 3-4 PCFS class”. The sample was described by calculating the median (Me) values and interquartile range expressed as Q1 and Q3 (Q0.25-Q0.75). The reliability of the differences between independent samples was assessed with nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test and the Student’s t-test. 
Upon evaluation of clinical blood biochemistry, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level in group 1 was higher than in groups 2 and 4, the aspartate aminotrasferase (AST) level in group 2 was higher than in groups 1 and 3. The indexes of total cholesterol and LDL did not show statistically significant differences between the groups. Creatinine levels in group 3 are higher than in group 1, being lower in group 4 than in other groups. Significant differences were observed upon qualitative assessment of C-reactive protein (CRP). There were 2-3 times more subjects with elevated CRP levels in groups 2 and 4 than in group 1. 
A minimal biochemical profile, including an assessment of the level of transaminases and creatinine, a qualitative or quantitative assessment of C-reactive protein, may indicate development of chronic inflammation. Patients of this group need to undergo an additional examination, e.g., general urine analysis and determination of albumin level in urine, dynamic GFR calculation, in order to prevent the development of persistent renal impairment.">

        <tr id="Human milk-derived extracellular vesicles (HMEVs) are key components in breast milk, promoting infant health and development. Maternal conditions could affect HMEV cargo; however, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HMEVs remains unknown. This study investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on postpartum HMEV molecules. The median duration from SARS-CoV-2 test positivity to milk collection was 3 months. After defatting and casein micelle disaggregation, HMEVs were isolated from milk samples of nine mothers with prenatal SARS-CoV-2 and six controls by sequential centrifugation, ultrafiltration, and qEV-size exclusion chromatography. The presence of HMEV was confirmed via transmission electron microscopy. Nanoparticle tracking analysis demonstrated particle diameters of <200 nm and yields of >1 × 1011 particles per mL of milk. Western immunoblots detected ALIX, CD9, and HSP70, supporting the presence of HMEVs in the isolates. Cargo from thousands of HMEVs were analyzed using a multi-omics approach, including proteomics and microRNA sequencing, and predicted that mothers with prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection produced HMEVs with enhanced functionalities involving metabolic reprogramming, mucosal tissue development, and immunomodulation. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy boosts mucosal site-specific functions of HMEVs, potentially protecting infants against viral infections. Further prospective studies should be pursued to reevaluate the short- and long-term benefits of breastfeeding in the post-COVID era.">

        <tr id="We have previously shown that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1E2 envelope glycoprotein can regulate HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) activity through disruption to NF-κB activation. This response is associated with upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S, M, and E but not the N structural protein can perform similar downmodulation of HIV-1 LTR activation, and in a dose-dependent manner, in both HEK293 and lung BEAS-2B cell lines. This effect is highest with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S strain and decreases over time for the subsequent emerging variants of concern (VOC), with Omicron providing the weakest effect. We developed pseudo-typed viral particle (PVP) viral tools that allowed for the generation of cell lines constitutively expressing the four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and utilising the VSV-g envelope protein to deliver the integrated gene construct. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed on cells expressing S, E, M, or N to determine cell activation status. Gene expression differences were found in a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IF16, IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15, as well as for a number of heat shock protein (HSP) genes, including HSPH1, HSPA6, and HSPBP1, with all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. There were also differences observed in expression patterns of transcription factors, with both SP1 and MAVS upregulated in the presence of S, M, and E but not the N protein. Collectively, the results indicate that gene expression patterns associated with ER stress pathways can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein expression. The results suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate an array of cell pathways, resulting in disruption to NF-κB signalling, hence providing alterations to multiple physiological responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 is believed to cause cytopathic effects in forming multinucleated cells, known as syncytia. Syncytia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection found in lung tissue samples of COVID-19 patients represents a case of COVID-19 with a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is very important to study the mechanism of syncytia formation and to test candidate materials that can inhibit the occurrence of syncytia and potentially be applied in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Since syncytia counting and analysis are time-consuming, we utilized a high-content screening (HCS) instrument in this study to automate syncytia analysis. We used 293T cells transfected with plasmids to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), and a plasmid encoding lifeact-GFP as an F-actin biosensor to facilitate syncytia analysis using the HCS instrument. In this study, syncytia analysis was carried out using HCS software. The HCS application categorizes cells as multi-nuclei by counting the number of cell nuclei stained with DAPI in cells that emitted green fluorescence due to lifeact-GFP expression. Syncytia analysis is time-consuming because of the calculation of the number of syncytia formed in a confluent cell monolayer culture. Hopefully, utilizing the HCS platform can accelerate the test of syncytia inhibition after various treatments using test compounds.Keywords: 293T cells, high-content analysis, SARS-CoV-2, spike, syncytia.">

        <tr id="The spatial organization of adaptive immune cells within lymph nodes is critical for understanding immune responses during infection and disease. Here, we introduce AIR-SPACE, an integrative approach that combines high-resolution spatial transcriptomics with paired, high-fidelity long-read sequencing of T and B cell receptors. This method enables the simultaneous analysis of cellular transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires within their native spatial context. We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated sub-anatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs. Overall, our study demonstrates how AIR-SPACE can be used to gain insight into the spatial dynamics of infection responses within lymphoid organs.">

However, they showed favorable clinical outcomes after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or molnupiravir, despite the antiviral therapies being initiated later in the clinical course.

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) ESX-1, a type VII secretion system, is a key virulence determinant contributing to MTB’s survival within lung mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), but its effect on MNP recruitment and differentiation remains unknown. Here, using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing techniques, we studied the role of ESX-1 in MNP heterogeneity and response in mice and murine bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDM). We found that ESX-1 is required for MTB to recruit diverse MNP subsets with high MTB burden. Further, MTB induces a transcriptional signature of immune evasion in lung macrophages and BMDM in an ESX-1–dependent manner. Spatial transcriptomics revealed an up-regulation of permissive features within MTB lesions, where monocyte-derived macrophages concentrate near MTB-infected cells. Together, our findings suggest that MTB ESX-1 facilitates the recruitment and differentiation of MNPs, which MTB can infect and manipulate for survival. Our dataset across various models and methods could contribute to the broader understanding of recruited cell heterogeneity during MTB lung infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we observed that patients received anti-CD20 therapy progressed to severe pneumonia and underwent persistent viral shedding. We aimed to identify the association between anti-CD20 therapy and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as the outcomes of COVID-19. Methods Using claims data derived from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, we conducted a matched nationwide retrospective cohort study. We included individuals aged ≥ 20 years diagnosed with conditions for which anti-CD20 therapy could be considered from January 2020 to December 2021. We defined the exposure variable by prescribing rituximab (RTX) at least once according to the database. COVID-19-related outcomes included hospitalization for COVID-19, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation administration, and all-case death. Patients prescribed RTX and those not prescribed RTX were defined as RTX users and non-users, respectively. The RTX users and non-users were 1:10 propensity score matched using sex, age, insurance type, and comorbidities. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between RTX and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as COVID-19-related outcomes. Results After 1:10 propensity score matching, 932 RTX users and 8,361 RTX non-users were analyzed. The proportion of vaccinated individuals was significantly lower in RTX users than in RTX non-users (69.3% vs. 90.9%; P < 0.001). RTX use was associated with an increased risk of all-case death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39–2.46, P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis for vaccinated individuals, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly greater for RTX users compared to non-users (aOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.02–6.04, P = 0.045), and RTX use was also associated with a significantly increased risk of hospitalization (aOR 3.79, 95% CI 1.28–11.23, P = 0.016) and all-case death (aOR 3.85, 95% CI 2.54–5.84, P < 0.001). Conclusion The use of RTX was associated with an increased risk of all-cause death in immunocompromised patients.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus transmitted via aerosols. To understand how MeV exits the airways of an infected host, we use unpassaged primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE). MeV typically remains cell-associated in HAE and forms foci of infection, termed infectious centers, by directly spreading cell-to-cell. We previously described the phenomenon in which infectious centers detach en masse from HAE and remain viable. Here, we investigate the mechanism of this cellular detachment. Via immunostaining, we observed loss of tight junction and cell adhesion proteins within infectious centers. These morphological changes indicate activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT can contribute to wound healing in respiratory epithelia by mobilizing nearby cells. Inhibiting TGF-β, and thus EMT, reduced infectious center detachment. Compared with uninfected cells, MeV-infected cells also expressed increased levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a regulator of live cell extrusion. Live cell extrusion encourages cells to detach from respiratory epithelia by contracting the actomyosin of neighboring cells. Inhibition or induction of live cell extrusion impacted infectious center detachment rates. Thus, these two related pathways contributed to infectious center detachment in HAE. Detached infectious centers contained high titers of virus that may be protected from the environment, allowing the virus to live on surfaces longer and infect more hosts. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely contagious respiratory pathogen that continues to cause large, disruptive outbreaks each year. Here, we examine mechanisms of detachment of MeV-infected cells. MeV spreads cell-to-cell in human airway epithelial cells (HAE) to form groups of infected cells, termed “infectious centers”. We reported that infectious centers ultimately detach from HAE as a unit, carrying high titers of virus. Viral particles within cells may be more protected from environmental conditions, such as ultraviolet radiation and desiccation. We identified two host pathways, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and live cell extrusion, that contribute to infectious center detachment. Perturbing these pathways altered the kinetics of infectious center detachment. These pathways influence one another and contribute to epithelial wound healing, suggesting that infectious center detachment may be a usurped consequence of the host’s response to infection that benefits MeV by increasing its transmissibility between hosts.">

        <tr id="Cranial radiotherapy causes progressive neurocognitive impairments in cancer survivors. Neuroinflammation is believed to be a key contributor, but its dynamics and consequences for brain function remain poorly understood. Here, we performed comprehensive longitudinal profiling, from 6 hours to 1 year after irradiation (IR) of the mouse hippocampus, using transcriptomic, protein and histological analyses. We identified a delayed microglial response coupling interferon signaling to mitotic progression, and a subsequent induction of temporally regulated subtypes. IR rewired the parenchymal phagocyte profiles due to progressive microglial loss, failure of repopulation through self-renewal and compensatory generation of microglia-like cells derived from peripheral monocytes. These findings were confirmed in autopsied human brain. Finally, we demonstrate two phases of neuronal asynchrony, an early one associated with inflammation and a late one associated with synaptic aberrant regulation. These results provide comprehensive, longitudinal insights into microglia responses that can aid tailoring therapies to preserve cognition in cancer survivors.">

        <tr id="Sarcopenia, which diminishes lifespan and healthspan in the elderly, is commonly exacerbated by viral pneumonia, including influenza and COVID-19. In a study of influenza A pneumonia in mice, young mice fully recovered from sarcopenia, while older mice did not. We identified a population of tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages that form a spatial niche with satellite cells and myofibers in young mice but are lost with age. Mice with a gain-of-function mutation in the Mertk receptor maintained this macrophage-myofiber interaction during aging and fully recovered from influenza-induced sarcopenia. In contrast, deletion of Mertk in macrophages or loss of Cx3cr1 disrupted this niche, preventing muscle regeneration. Heterochronic parabiosis did not restore the niche in old mice. These findings suggest that age-related loss of Mertk in muscle tissue-resident macrophages disrupts the cellular signaling necessary for muscle regeneration after viral pneumonia, offering a potential target to mitigate sarcopenia in aging.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The majority of COVID-19 infections in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological (Heme-Onc) diagnoses are mild with good outcome compared to adults. Postulated reasons include cross-protection from immunity against seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV’s), subdued inflammatory responses in children than in adults and differences in humoral and T-cell responses. The objectives of this study are to compare antibody responses against HCoV’s, anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral, T-cell, and inflammatory profiles between Heme-Onc children with COVID-19 and control groups. Methods Binding IgG antibodies against Spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2, four HCoV’s (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), quantitative levels of 21 cytokines and 9 chemokines (multiplexed solid-phase electrochemiluminescence assay by Meso Scale Diagnostics/MSD) were compared among five cohorts: 1) children with Heme-Onc diagnoses and COVID-19 (n = 41) 2) healthy children with COVID-19 (n = 21) 3) adults with COVID-19 (n = 14) 4) children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) [n = 23] and 5) healthy children without COVID-19 (n = 12). Additionally, T-cell responses against S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using ELISpot in Heme-Onc children a group of healthy children COVID-19. Results Anti-S antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV were significantly lower in children in Heme-Onc and healthy children with COVID-19 compared to adults with COVID-19 (Figure 1). The concentration of eight pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly lower in Heme-Onc and healthy children compared to adults with COVID-19 and children with MIS-C. The responder T-cell frequency varied between 0 and 860/100,000 PBMC at study enrollment in children with Heme-Onc diagnoses. Conclusion In this single-center study, cross-protection from HCoV antibodies is an unlikely mechanism to explain mild COVID-19 in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological diagnoses. Subdued inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be one of the factors for the mild COVID-19 disease phenotype in children.

        <tr id="Monocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) play a pivotal role in surveillance and homeostasis, and can exacerbate pathogenic processes during injury, infection, or inflammation. CD14+CD16+ monocytes exhibit diverse functions and contribute to neuroinflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-NCI). Analysis of human CD14+CD16+ monocytes matured in vitro by single-cell RNA sequencing identified a heterogenous population of nine clusters. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in each cluster identified increased migratory and inflammatory pathways for a group of clusters, which we termed Group 1 monocytes. Group 1 monocytes, distinguished by increased ALCAM, CD52, CD63, and SDC2, exhibited gene expression signatures implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases, produced higher levels of CXCL12, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and ROS, and preferentially transmigrated across a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model. Thus, Group 1 cells within the CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset are likely to be major contributors to neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical syndrome with a mortality rate of up to 40%, and it is characterized by a prominent inflammatory cascade. The inflammasome and pyroptosis play crucial regulatory roles in regulating various inflammatory-related diseases by serving as pivotal signaling platforms for inflammatory responses and mediating the release of substantial quantities of inflammatory factors. Our previous studies confirmed that GC-1, a clinical-stage thyroid hormone analog, effectively mitigated pulmonary fibrosis by restoring mitochondrial function in epithelial cells. However, the potential effects of GC-1 on macrophage inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis in lung injury as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. Methods: The effects of GC-1 on lung injury, oxidative damage and inflammation were evaluated in two murine models of ALI (LPS- or HCl-induced models) by assessing lung pathology, the concentrations of IL-1β and IL-18 in BAL fluid, inflammasome and the levels of inflammasome- and pyroptosis-related proteins. Additionally, the impact of GC-1 on ROS-mediated inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis was investigated by examining ROS levels, Nrf2 signaling, and inflammasome adaptor protein ASC levels in mouse alveolar macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages treated with LPS and ATP. The Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 and the mitochondrial-ROS inhibitor Mito-TEMPO were used to further elucidate the effect of GC-1 on the Nrf2-p53-ASC pathway. Results: GC-1 significantly alleviated inflammation and lung injury in ALI model mice, as indicated by pulmonary pathology, inflammatory cytokine levels, ROS production and pyroptosis rates. Consistently, GC-1 inhibited ASC recruitment and oligomerization in macrophages, which suppressed the gasdermin D-mediated release of IL-1β and IL-18. These findings indicated a reduction in inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis initiation. Further research revealed that GC-1 may mitigate oxidative stress induced by mitochondrial damage through Nrf2 signaling, thereby inhibiting the expression of ROS-activated p53 and the target gene ASC. This protective effect of GC-1 could be reversed by ML385 and mimicked by Mito-TEMPO. Conclusions: This study presents a novel mechanism for treating ALI in which GC-1 inhibits macrophage ROS-mediated inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis through Nrf2-p53-ASC pathway. These findings highlight the promising potential of the use of GC-1 as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drug in the treatment of ALI/ARDS.">

        <tr id="Objective: the viral load is determined by the cycle threshold (Ct), which is inversely proportional to the amount of target sequences present in the sample. In various viral diseases, the induction of inflammatory cytokines is strongly correlated with the viral load. However, the viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly characterized, and its association with disease progression remains controversial. This study aimed to understand the correlation between the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and the biochemical and hematological markers in COVID-19-positive patients.
Methods: data from patients with detectable viral load for SARS-CoV-2 treated between March 2020 and May 2021 were collected between Jan/2023 and Jan/2024. Data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation, Student's t-test, and analysis of variance.
Results: the mean Ct values for the N and ORF1AB genes were 26.73 (±3.95) and 25.93 (±4.75), respectively. A Ct value below the mean for the N and ORF1AB genes, suggesting a higher viral load, was observed in 17.8% (n=152) and 18.4% (n=157) of the patients. There was no correlation between the mean Ct and hematological or biochemical parameters, but the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was below the reference value for COVID-19-negative patients (P<0.0001). The C-reactive protein and ferritin levels were higher in patients with COVID-19 (P<0.05). Leucopenia (P<0.001), lymphocytopenia (P<0.001), neutropenia (P<0.001), and thrombocytopenia (P=0.003) were observed more frequently in patients with COVID-19.
Conclusion: the MLR below the reference value was more frequent observed in patients with a higher Ct value (lower viral load).">

        <tr id="Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Several studies report that up to 50% of individuals who recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a plethora of long-COVID symptoms for weeks, months, or even up to a year. Abnormal pulmonary function is one of the most critical manifestations of long-COVID even after recovering from COVID-19. Understanding the long-term pulmonary consequences and immune response among individuals recovering from COVID-19, who experienced disease severity ranging from mild to severe symptoms, is crucial for comprehensive post-recovery care and vaccination strategies. Methods: This prospective case-control study included 29 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 with a history of mild to severe symptoms and 64 controls. Assessments of pulmonary functional measures, such as FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF, MEF, and PEF were carried out following recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, IgG antibody responses were examined by ELISA for up to six months through multiple follow-ups following two doses of vaccination, with an additional follow-up 30 days after the booster dose (third dose). Results: Pulmonary functional abnormalities were prevalent in the recovered group who previously exhibited different symptoms (53% mild, 66% moderate, and 50% severe) compared to the control group (23%). Higher IgG antibody titers were observed among the recovered groups, significantly elevated in severe and moderate cases following vaccination. Following vaccination, the recovered group who experienced disease history showed significantly higher titers at day 14, particularly in severe (1418 IU/mL) and moderate (1390 IU/mL) groups compared to the control group (968 IU/mL) (p<0.005). Notably, antibody titers are negatively correlated with pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). All groups experienced a significant (p<0.005) decrease in antibody titers within 90-120 days of two doses of vaccination. After five to six months, the titers were comparable to the baseline titer, indicating the importance of vaccination and booster doses regardless of previous infection history. Overall, our study underscores the significance of pulmonary function assessment post-COVID-19 recovery for long-term respiratory health and emphasizes the importance of vaccination regardless of infectious history. To ensure long-term respiratory health, this study emphasizes the significance of evaluating pulmonary function in those who might have contained asymptomatic COVID-19 infections as well as those who have recovered from symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, these findings underscore the importance of vaccination regardless of infection history as a key strategy in pandemic preparedness. Conclusions: To assess the impact of long-COVID on respiratory health, this study underscores the importance of evaluating pulmonary function in individuals, whether they had symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. Furthermore, the findings from the immune response analysis highlight the critical role of vaccination, regardless of infection history, as a key strategy of pandemic preparedness.">

The cells were harvested at 1, 2, and 3 days post-exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and IL-6, TNF-ɑ, and malondialdehyde (MDA) production were quantified and compared. Compared to those exposed to medium, co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs exposed to a concentration of S1 protein at 10 μg/mL demonstrated significantly increased levels of LDH release (22.9% vs. 9.1%, and 25.7%), IL-6 (129 vs. 74, and 110 pg/mg of protein), and TNF-ɑ (75 vs. 51, and 86 pg/mg of protein) production, and similar to those exposed to LPS. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in MDA production.

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is a complex and multifaceted clinical challenge requiring to emphasize its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This study assessed hundreds of virological, serological, immunological, and tissue damage biomarkers in two patient cohorts who experienced mild (n=270) or severe (n=188) COVID-19, 6 to 9 months post-initial infection, and in which 40% and 57.4% of patients, respectively, developed PASC. Blood analysis showed that mains differences observed in humoral, viral, and biological biomarkers were associated with the initial COVID-19 severity, rather than being specifically linked to PASC. However, patients with PASC displayed altered CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell subsets, with higher cytokine-secreting cells and increased terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector memory T cells (TEMRA).

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several cardiovascular complications, including myocarditis, which can be a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause cardiac muscle inflammation through direct mechanisms, such as viral invasion of myocardial cells, and indirect mechanisms, such as the systemic inflammatory response. Myocarditis can lead to life-threatening electrical dysfunctions and arrhythmias. Although post-infection myocarditis is more common, rare cases of post-vaccination myocarditis have also been reported, especially with mRNA vaccines. However, these post-vaccination cases tend to be mild and self-limiting, with a good response to treatment. Despite the associated risks, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, significantly reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections and related heart complications. It is crucial to continue surveillance and research to better understand the association between COVID-19, myocarditis and sudden cardiac death in the young and improve prevention and intervention strategies. In this literature review, we analyzed the pathogenetic mechanisms and histological features of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 and its vaccination, and focused on the correlation with sudden cardiac death.">

        <tr id="Type III interferons (IFNs) primarily act on epithelial cells and protect against virus infection of the mucosa, whereas type I IFNs act more systemically. To date, it has been unknown which epithelial subtypes in the upper airways, the primary site for initial infection for most respiratory viruses, primarily rely on type III IFN or type I IFNs for antiviral protection. To address this question, we performed a single-cell transcriptomics analysis of the epithelial IFN-mediated response focusing on the upper airways of mice. This work identified nine distinct cell types derived from the olfactory epithelium and thirteen distinct cell types from the respiratory epithelium. Interestingly, type I IFNs induced a stronger antiviral transcriptional response than type III IFN in respiratory epithelial cells, whereas in olfactory epithelial cells, including sustentacular (SUS) and Bowman's gland cells (BGC), type III IFN was more dominant compared to type I IFN. SUS and BGC, which provide structural support and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, were highly susceptible to infection with a mouse-adapted variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA20) but were protected against infection if the animals were prophylactically treated with type III IFN. These findings demonstrate a high degree of cell type heterogeneity in terms of interferon-mediated antiviral responses and reveal a potent role for type III IFNs in protecting the olfactory epithelium.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 infects SUS and BGC in the olfactory epithelium, causing an impairment of structural support and integrity of olfactory sensory neurons that can result in severe olfactory dysfunctions. We observed an unexpected compartmentalization of the IFN-mediated transcriptional response within the airway epithelium, and we found that olfactory epithelial cells preferentially respond to type III IFN, which resulted in robust antiviral protection of SUS and BGC. Given the proximity of the olfactory epithelium to the central nervous system, we hypothesize that evolution favored a type III IFN-biased antiviral immune response in this tissue to limit inflammatory responses in the brain. Cell type-specific antiviral responses in the upper airways, triggered by the different types of IFNs, should be investigated in more detail and carefully taken into consideration during the development of IFN-based antivirals for clinical use.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Understanding the behavior of B cells during infection and vaccination is important for determining protective humoral immunity. We evaluated the profile of humoral immunity and B cell pool in individuals who were acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2, recovered from COVID-19, or received two doses of the AZD1222 vaccine. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these individuals were subjected to in vitro stimulation to promote the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and the ELISpot evaluated the abundance of pan and SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1-reactive IgG+ ASC. Stimulated PBMCs were characterized using flow cytometry. Culture supernatants were assessed for soluble B-cell-activating factors. The IgA and IgG for the S1 were evaluated through ELISA. Results: The recovered individuals displayed a robust S1 ASC compared to acute and vaccinated individuals. Although the frequency of total B cells or B cell subsets did not vary among the groups, plasmablast cells were increased in naïve and double-negative B cells in the acute, recovered, and vaccinated individuals. Similar IgA and IgG production appeared to be present in the acute and recovered individuals. During vaccination, more IgG is produced than IgA. In acute patients, BAFF levels were positively correlated with total B cells and IgG+ plasmablast cells but negatively correlated with IgA+ plasmablast cells. Conclusions: Vaccination and natural infection with COVID-19 induce a differential profile and functionality of B cells. We suggest that new vaccines against COVID-19 incorporate molecular adjuvants that regulate B lymphocyte functionality and consider the beneficial aspects of the IgA response in addition to IgG.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Etiology remains elusive for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), and no treatment exists. Antivirals had no efficacy in randomized clinical trials (RCT) for Epstein-Barr Virus and HHV-6. Enteroviruses (EV) have been implicated, but no antivirals are available. Many patients who received SARS–CoV-2-specific antiviral drugs for acute Covid-19 (COV19) infection experienced significant improvement of prior ME/CFS symptoms. This study summarizes their responses to antivirals for SARS-Cov-2. Methods Neutralizing Antibody (NA) for Coxsackievirus B (CVB)1-6 and Echovirus 6, 7, 9, 11, 30 were done by ARUP lab. Enterovirus Protein (EVP) of Peripheral Blood Leukocytes (PBL) was determined by Western Blot. ME/CFS patients fulfilled Canadian consensus criteria, and had either elevated NA for enteroviruses and/or positive EVP in PBL. ME/CFS patients hospitalized for acute COV19 infection and patients without COV19, were given 5-10 days of IV Remdesivir (Rem) +/- immune modulators. Controls: 20 ME/CFS patients seen concurrently without Remdesivir treatment. Other ME/CFS patients (non-COV19) were given Nirmaltrelvir/Ritonavir (PAX) daily for 10 days +/- one repeat. The energy index (EI) was monitored by the patients before, during and after treatment. Significant improvement was defined as > 30%. Results 15/20 (75%) ME/CFS patients – 10/12 hospitalized, 5/8 non-COV19 patients – responded to IV Rem 2-6 weeks after infusions; remission lasted 6-8 weeks to 6-9 months before relapse. Of Controls: 2/20 had mild improvement (< 0.001, X 2 ). 104/200 (52%) of PAX-treated ME/CFS patients improved, often within 2-3 days; all relapsed within days to weeks after treatment. 66%, 33% and 44% of CVB4+, CVB3+, non-CVB3,4+ patients responded to treatment, respectively. EVP decreased and increased with clinical response and relapse. Conclusion Rem and PAX demonstrated clinical efficacy in ME/CFS patients with chronic enterovirus infections. Placebo-controlled RCT will be needed to clarify the role of antivirals in ME/CFS. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="HIV infection exerts profound and long-lasting neurodegenerative effects on the central nervous system (CNS) that can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we used single-nucleus multiome sequencing to map the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of postmortem human brains from 13 healthy individuals and 20 individuals with HIV who have a history of treatment with ART. Our study spanned three distinct regions—the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and ventral striatum—enabling a comprehensive exploration of region-specific and cross-regional perturbations. We found widespread and persistent HIV-associated transcriptional and epigenetic alterations across multiple cell types. Detailed analyses of microglia revealed state changes marked by immune activation and metabolic dysregulation, while integrative multiomic profiling of astrocytes identified multiple subpopulations, including a reactive subpopulation unique to HIV-infected brains. These findings suggest that cells from people with HIV exhibit molecular shifts that may underlie ongoing neuroinflammation and CNS dysfunction. Furthermore, cell–cell communication analyses uncovered dysregulated and pro-inflammatory interactions among glial populations, underscoring the multifaceted and enduring impact of HIV on the brain milieu. Collectively, our comprehensive atlas of HIV-associated brain changes reveals distinct glial cell states with signatures of pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic dysregulation, providing a framework for developing targeted therapies for HIV-associated neurological dysfunction.">

Being critical to CNS homeostasis, microglia also have been shown to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancer. Hence, microglia are regarded as a potential therapeutic target in CNS diseases, resulting in an increased demand for reliable in vitro models. Two human microglia cell lines (HMC3 and C20) are being used in multiple in vitro studies, however, the knowledge of their biological and immunological characteristics remains limited. Our aim was to identify and compare the biological changes in these immortalised immune cells under normal physiological and immunologically challenged conditions. Using high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, we have examined in-depth proteomic profiles of non-stimulated and LPS or IFN-γ challenged HMC3 and C20 cells. Our findings reveal that HMC3 cells responded to both treatments through upregulation of immune, metabolic, and antiviral pathways, while C20 cells showed a response associated with mitochondrial and immune activities. Additionally, the secretome analysis demonstrated that both cell lines release IL-6 in response to LPS, while IFN-γ treatment resulted in altered kynurenine pathway activity, highlighting distinct immune and metabolic adaptations.">

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with increased rates of severe disease, hospitalization, and death in elderly individuals. Clearance of RSV is frequently delayed within this demographic, contributing to the more severe disease course. Geriatric cotton rats mimic this prolonged clearance kinetic and serve as a useful animal model for studying age-associated immunological deficits during RSV infection. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen restores RSV clearance, indicating that inflammation contributes to impaired clearance in geriatric cotton rats. Here, we further characterize a compromised immune response in geriatric cotton rats and identify an inflammatory pathway that contributes to this deficiency. Dendritic cell (DC) activation and migration to mediastinal lymph nodes are decreased during early infection in geriatric cotton rats, resulting in delayed generation of cytotoxic T cells and virus clearance. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which reduces DC migration through the elevation of D-type prostanoid 1 receptor (DP1 receptor), is elevated in the airways of infected geriatric cotton rats. Reducing PGD2 production by inhibiting COX-2 or PGD2 synthase improves RSV clearance kinetics through DC activation and RSV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in geriatric cotton rats, whereas activation of DP1 receptor through an agonist resulted in delayed viral clearance in adult cotton rats. These results indicate that PGD2 contributes to delayed antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell responses to RSV in geriatric cotton rats. Inhibiting PGD2 generation or signaling may be a useful mechanism of therapeutic intervention in elderly individuals. IMPORTANCE Elderly adults are at increased risk of severe disease resulting from infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), characterized in part by delayed clearance (removal of the virus from airways). Understanding the immunological factors that lead to this delayed clearance may allow for the development of therapies to improve disease outcomes in elderly individuals infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Here, we describe an inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats, the preferred small animal laboratory model for RSV, that impairs the generation of an effective immune response. We show that inhibiting this inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats improves immune parameters and speeds clearance of RSV. These results contribute to our understanding of delayed RSV clearance in elderly individuals with possible applications for improving immune responses to RSV in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The pathogenesis of Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) following mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. In particular, the involvement of activated mast cells (MC) in the highly angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing small bowel, the largest lymphoid organ, might be significant in PCS pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of activated MC, residual SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and zonulin (a marker for impaired intestinal integrity), in the context of PCS, examining peripheral blood (PB) and terminal ileum (TI) 2 years post-infection. Methods In this cross-sectional, controlled study, paired PB and TI samples were obtained from 21 SARS-CoV-2 convalescents with (PCS+) and 11 without PCS (PCS−). CD117+CD25+ activated MC and residual S protein were assessed using fluorescent immunohistochemistry on sections of the the ileal tissue from the gut. Tryptase, zonulin and S protein were quantified in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry assessed frequencies of T-cells (CD3+CD4+ (TCD4), CD3+CD8+ T-cells (TCD8)) and CCR7±CD27± memory subsets (TCM: T central memory, TEM: T effector memory) on mononuclear cells of PB and TI. Results Among PCS+ and PCS−, median follow up was 22 and 18 months post-infection, 81% and 73% were female, and 57% and 55% had pre-existing conditions of which arterial hypertension, chronic lung disease and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent. Compared to PCS−, PCS+ expressed significantly more MC (p< 0.0001) in ileal sections, along with elevated levels of tryptase (p=0.0196) and zonulin (p=0.024) in PB. S protein, by contrast, was undetectable in PB of PCS+ and PCS− even 2 years post-infection. In TI however, the frequency of tissue-resident S protein-infected cells was significantly higher in PCS+ compared to PCS− (p=0.0135). Interestingly, systemic tryptase levels correlated positively to elevated TCM in TI (r=0.7407, p=0.0034). Conclusion Elevated MC activity and S protein in the TI, along with increased tryptase and zonulin levels in PB, indicate ongoing immune activation and intestinal damage in the TI of PCS+. Understanding the role of tissue-resident MC in PCS pathogenesis could lead to targeted therapies. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="Background: Two novel malaria vaccines, RTS,S and R21, mark a significant step forward in malaria research, but eradication demands vaccines with higher efficacy. Recent trials using late-arresting genetically attenuated parasites (LA-GAP) highlight their effectiveness as next-generation vaccines, likely through CD8+ T-cell activation targeting late liver-stage parasites. However, the distribution of LA-GAP-activated T cells in different organs that culminate towards high-level protection in the liver remains unclear. Methods: This study aimed to map immune responses in the livers and lungs of mice immunized with LA-GAP, shedding light on the role of different organs in priming T-cell responses towards immunity. Results: Particularly in the lungs we found an impressive increase of CD8+, double negative T cells (5%), γδ (2.5%), effector memory CD8+ T cells (46%), and tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (3%). These lung T cells are highly activated (expressing CD11c, Ki67, KLRG1) and exhibited 4-fold higher Granzyme A expression and significant TNF+ cell increases as compared to their liver counterparts (10.2% vs 2.6%). These differences start already at the early 2-day timepoint at which time the lungs show an impressive 10.2% increase in TNF+ CD8+ T cells, whereas the liver shows a more modest increase of 2.6% of these cells. Conclusion: These findings highlight the lungs as a crucial site for immune priming and T-cell activation, underscoring the need for further investigation of organ-specific responses to fully understand the potential of LA-GAP immunization as a powerful strategy in the fight against malaria.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a respiratory disease that can range in presentation from mild symptoms to severe conditions such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus, spreads through aerosols and respiratory droplets. It enters human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, leading to various complications, including significant alterations in red blood cells and potential disruptions in haemoglobin function and oxygen transport. During infection, the interaction between hypoxia, inflammation, and haematopoiesis affects erythropoiesis at multiple levels. Hypoxia and inflammation, resulting from lung complications and a reduced red blood cell count, influence the regulation of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron levels in the blood. Elevated hepcidin levels are associated with hypoxia and the suppression of erythroferrone, a hormone that normally inhibits hepcidin production. Despite high levels of inflammation, patients in intensive care units often exhibit elevated ferritin levels, which, rather than indicating low hepcidin, suggest disrupted iron metabolism and the development of severe anaemia. Iron is kept in stores, likely due to paradoxically high hepcidin levels, which explains the elevated ferritin measurements. An increase in immature blood cells and a decrease in CD71+ erythroid cells are observed. The elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells highlight their dual role in modulating hyper-inflammation and immune response during disease progression. This review examines the pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 affects red blood cell production and the haematopoietic system and how it triggers cytokine storms through interleukins, immature blood cells, and CD71+ erythroid cells. Understanding these processes provides novel pathways for managing haematological manifestations and immune responses in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="La Crosse virus (LACV), a negative-sense RNA bunyavirus, is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in the United States, disproportionately affecting children under the age of 16 years. Although LACV can lead to severe morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable pediatric population, no vaccines or specific antiviral therapies are currently available. Murine models recapitulate the age-dependent susceptibility observed in humans, whereby weanling mice (3 weeks old) succumb to LACV-induced neurological disease and adult mice (≥8 weeks old) exhibit resistance. In this study, we systematically characterized the T cell-mediated responses that underlie this differential susceptibility. We show that adult mice mount robust, polyfunctional LACV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against structural and non-structural proteins as early as 6 days post-infection (dpi), with sustained production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granzyme B, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). We further show that these T cells expand significantly in adult mice and display in vivo cytotoxicity against targeted cells pulsed with immunogenic antigens derived from the envelope Gc and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In contrast, weanling mice exhibit significantly weaker T cell responses, as evidenced by reduced expansion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and diminished cytokine production, correlating with 100% mortality by 7 dpi. Importantly, immunization studies with LFn-LACV-Gc and -N significantly improve in vivo T cell cytotoxicity and survival in weanlings, highlighting their potential as vaccine candidates. Collectively, our findings define key cellular correlates of protection against LACV and establish a framework for the development of pediatric vaccines designed to mitigate the public health burden of LACV-induced encephalitis.">

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post- vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 3–6% of people suffer from post-COVID condition or syndrome (PCS). A subset meets the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA can persist after acute infection in serum or tissues, but their role in PCS is unclear. Methods: Here, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analyzed in the serum of 121 PCS patients with predominant fatigue and exertional intolerance, of whom 72 met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, 37 post-COVID recovered healthy controls, and 32 pre-pandemic healthy controls. Results: Spike protein was detected in the serum of 11% of recovered controls, 2% of PCS patients, and 14% of ME/CFS patients between 4 and 31 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not in pre-pandemic samples. The occurrence and concentration of spike protein did not correlate with infection or vaccination timepoints. In ME/CFS patients, spike protein presence was not associated with the severity of symptoms or functional disability. In 5 out of 22 patients who under-went immunoglobulin depletion, spike protein levels were reduced or undetectable after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins. Conclusions: In summary, this study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients but found no association with ME/CFS.">

We performed snRNA-seq and image-based spatial transcriptomics of human caudate nucleus and putamen (dorsal striatum) from PD and Control brain donors to elucidate the diversity of oligodendroglia and how they are affected by the disease. We have defined fifteen subclasses, from precursor to mature cells, four of which are disease-associated. These PD-specific populations are characterized by the overexpression of heat shock proteins and distinct expression signatures, including immune responses and myelination alterations. We have also identified disruptions in cell communication and oligodendrocyte development, evidenced by changes in neurotransmitter receptors expression and cell adhesion molecules. These transcriptomic changes correlated with impaired myelin integrity and altered oligodendrocyte distribution in the striatum. Thus, we uncover oligodendroglia as a critical cell type in PD and a potential new therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting from an abnormal immune response to normal stimuli, such as food and intestinal flora. Since the etiology of this disease remains largely unknown, murine models induced by the consumption of dextran-sodium sulfate serve as a pivotal tool for studying colon inflammation. In this study, we employed both acute and chronic colitis mouse models induced by varying durations of dextran-sodium sulfate consumption to investigate the pathological and immunologic characteristics throughout the disease course. During the acute phase, activated innate inflammation marked by M1 macrophage infiltration was prominent. In contrast, the chronic phase was characterized by tissue remodeling, with a significant increase in M2 macrophages and lymphocytes. RNA-sequencing revealed genetic changes in acute and chronic colitis, marked by the maintenance of genomic integrity in the acute phase and extracellular matrix dynamics in the chronic phase. These phase-specific alterations reflect the multifaceted physiological processes involved in the initiation and progression of inflammation in the large intestine, underscoring the necessity for distinct experimental approaches for each phase. The findings demonstrate that the factors shaping the large intestinal immune microenvironment change specifically during the acute and chronic phases of experimental inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting the importance of developing therapeutic strategies that align with the disease course.">

        <tr id="The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post-stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p-MCAO]) is utilized to profile single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain-resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post-stroke disease-related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease-associated microglia, possibly arising from pre-existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post-stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2 infection induces interferon (IFN) response by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we show that the bulk of the IFN-I release comes from pDC sensing of infected cells and not cell-free virions. Physical contact (or conjugates) between pDCs and infected cells is mediated through CD54-CD11a engagement, and such conjugate formation is required for efficient IFN-I production. Interestingly, CD11a is inducible on infected epithelial cells when they are co-cultured with PBMCs, thus allowing for potentially bidirectional cross-talks between CD54 and CD11a, which further amplify the sensing. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) are sensed less efficiently than the Wuhan ancestral strain (LSPQ1), but the mechanisms driving the defect are different among the VOCs. CD11a induction on infected cells is correlated with their ability to form cell conjugates with pDCs. Impaired sensing of the Alpha variant is linked to reduced CD11a induction on infected cells and to fewer conjugates formed with pDCs. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into how SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are sensed by pDCs and reveal that this process is targeted by some VOCs to limit IFN-I production. IMPORTANCE Type I interferons (IFN-I) represent an important component of the host’s innate defense against initial SARS-CoV-2 infections. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce large quantities of IFN-I upon recognition of viral particles or infected cells. This study shows that pDCs sense infected cells more efficiently than viral particles, leading to a higher production of IFN-I. Physical contact between a pDC and an infected cell is critical to this process; the interaction is mediated via CD11a and ICAM-1 complex and potentially is bidirectional. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have evolved to limit the IFN response through different mechanisms. For the Alpha variant, reduced level of CD11a on infected cells is linked to less contact with pDCs and decreased IFN-I release. Overall, our study characterizes some of the early steps involved in pDC-mediated response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and shows that these processes are targeted by VOCs to likely limit IFN-I response and enhance viral spread.">

        <tr id="Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, poses a significant global health challenge, especially among high-risk populations. This study investigates the temporal dynamics of pulmonary gene expression during S. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia using a murine model to elucidate host-pathogen interactions and identify potential biomarkers of disease severity. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we analyzed lung tissues at early (1h, 8h) and acute infection (2d, 3d), as well as post-resolution (30d) time-points. At 2 days post-infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed heightened innate immune responses, including chemokine and interferon signaling pathways. By 30 days post-infection, gene expression profiles and histological changes normalized, reflecting resolution of inflammation. Stratifying mice into recovered, sick, and moribund phenotypes during the acute infection phase highlighted significant transcriptional distinctions, including upregulated pro-inflammatory genes and Schlafen family members. Arginase 1 emerged as a predictive marker of disease severity, with elevated expression detectable as early as 8 hours post-infection. Comparative analyses revealed significant overlap between transcriptional responses in our model and those from a Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia model, implicating conserved pathways, such as IL-17 and Toll-like receptor signaling. Additionally, murine DEGs correlated with human plasma proteins associated with severe CAP, including CCL8 and CD14, suggesting translational relevance. This study underscores phase-specific transcriptional reprogramming during pneumococcal pneumonia and identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in severe CAP cases.">

        <tr id="Background: The Safety and Immunogenicity of COVID-19 Vaccines in Systemic Autoimmune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases (SUCCEED) study was created to better understand COVID-19 vaccination in immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID). Knowing the frequency of COVID-19 breakthrough infections is important, particularly in IMID. Our objective was to assess these events in IMID. Methods: We prospectively studied IMID participants who had received ≥three COVID-19 vaccine doses. Individuals provided saliva samples monthly (September 2022 to August 2023). These were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. We also assessed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (anti-spike, SmT1, receptor binding domain, RBD, and nucleocapsid, NP) based on dried blood spots. Multivariable general estimating equation regression produced odd ratios (OR) for PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity, related to demographics, immunosuppressives, and antibody levels. Results: Diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis RA (N = 161, 44% of the total), systemic lupus, psoriatic arthritis, spondylarthritis, vasculitis, systemic sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Of the 366 participants, most were taking immunosuppressive medication. Of 1266 saliva samples, 56 (5.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR. Higher anti-SmT1 antibodies were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection on PCR (adjusted OR 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.45–0.97). Antibodies to SmT1, RBD, and NP were correlated and thus could not be included in a single model, but when anti-RBD was used in place of anti-SmT1, the results were similar. No other factor (including prior COVID-19 infection) was clearly associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: This is the first study of SARS-CoV-2 in a large prospective cohort of triple (or more) vaccinated individuals with IMIDs. Anti-SmT1 antibodies appeared to be protective against later SARS-CoV-2 positivity, although recent past infection was not clearly related. This suggests the importance of maintaining robust vaccine-induced immunity through vaccination in IMID.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 global pandemic, leads to a wide variety of responses among patients. Some of them present a very severe phenotype, while others only experience mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. This differential prognosis is tightly related to the inflammatory status of the patient. Although WHO declared the end of the emergency, the pandemic caused a great socio-sanitary impact in all countries. Thus, the possible outbreak of new biological diseases in the future makes it necessary to deepen the knowledge of this uncontrolled immune response and look for reliable biomarkers to help us predict its potential health impact. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) as lipoxins are endogenous mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid in the resolution stage of any inflammatory process. These lipids have pro-resolving actions in several pathological models, including reducing NF-κB-mediated inflammation, and inducing the antioxidant response through the Nrf-2 pathway. Thus, although a potential relationship has already been suggested between low levels of SPMs and COVID-19 severity, their true role as a predictive biomarker is still unknown. Methods and results In this study, we have analyzed by ELISA the serum levels of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in a representative Spanish cohort. We found reduced levels in deceased patients when compared to mild or severe patients, concomitant with a decrease in the LXA4 biosynthetic pathway and an increase in its degradation pathway. Furthermore, we have studied the correlation between the levels of this SPM and several pathology indicators, finding a significant correlation between increased LXA4 levels and a better prognosis of the patients. Conclusion We propose to measure systemic LXA4 as a new promising biomarker to predict the survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and presumably to other viruses that can affect humanity in the future.">

        <tr id="Maladaptive host metabolic responses to infection are emerging as major determinants of infectious disease pathogenesis. However, the factors regulating these metabolic changes within tissues remain poorly understood. In this study, we used toxoplasmosis, as a prototypical example of a disease regulated by strong type I immune responses, to assess the relative roles of local parasite burden, local tissue inflammation and the microbiome in shaping local tissue metabolism during acute and chronic infection. Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This protozoan infects the small intestine and then disseminates to nearly every organ in the acute stage of infection, before establishing chronic infection in the skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and brain. We compared metabolism in eleven sampling sites in C57BL/6 mice during the acute and chronic stage of T. gondii infection. Strikingly, significant metabolic changes were observed in the large intestine and colon during chronic infection, organs not associated with T. gondii persistence. Overall, major spatial mismatches were observed between metabolic perturbation and local parasite burden for both disease stages. In contrast, a stronger association with indicators of type I immune responses was observed, indicating a tighter relationship between metabolic perturbation and local immunity, than with local parasite burden. In addition, we observed significant changes in microbiota composition with infection, and candidate microbial origins for multiple metabolites impacted by infection. These findings highlight the metabolic consequences of toxoplasmosis across different organs, and their regulators. Importance Inflammation is a major driver of tissue perturbation. However, the signals driving these changes on a tissue-intrinsic and molecular level are poorly understood. This study evaluated tissue-specific metabolic perturbations across eleven sampling sites following systemic murine infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Results revealed relationships between differential metabolite enrichment and variables including inflammatory signals, pathogen burden and commensal microbial communities. These data will inform hypotheses about the signals driving specific metabolic adaptation in acute and chronic protozoan infection, with broader implications for infection and inflammation in general.">

        <tr id="  COVID-19 disease is a clinical syndrome caused by an envelope RNA virus, called SARS-COV-2., which causes infection with wildly clinical pictures. Through COVID-19 infection several components of humoral and cellular immune response have an important role in the progression of the infection. Chemokines are one of the inflammatory mediators that play an essential role in the immune pathogenesis of COVID-19. It is secreted by respiratory virus-infected cells in the upper respiratory tract, causing stimulation and recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, NK, eosinophils, and macrophages from the bloodstream to the site of the infection. This study strives to determine the impact role of inflammatory mediator chemokine RANTES (CCL5) in COVID-19 Iraq patients. Blood samples collected from 180 individuals were enrolled in this study, 120 of them were patients infected with COVID-19 and verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patients were categorized into two groups based on the severity of the disease, the severe group included 60 patients and the mild/moderate group included 60 patients also. Furthermore, 60 healthy individuals who were confirmed to be COVID-19-negative were enrolled in this study as a control group. The quantitative detection of CCL5 in human serum was done by the CCL5 Enzyme Linked Immune Sorbent Assay kit based on the principle of sandwich ELISA. This study showed that there were interesting highly significant differences (p<0.001) in the median serum level of CCL5 between all groups that participated in this study and there was a significant increase in the median level of CCL5 in control and mild-moderate groups versus severe patients’ group (66.66 pg/ml, and 54.04 pg/ml vs. 38.41 pg/ml respectively). According to the results of this study, the low level of CCL5 associated with COVID-19 severity infection could be used as a predictor marker for severity while the elevated level of CCL5 in control and mild-moderate suggested the elevated level of this chemokine is likely to be associated with the resolution of inflammation and recovery.">

        <tr id="Background Model organisms allowing for longitudinal examinations of liver disease pathogenesis are pivotal for the development of new therapeutic modalities. The eastern North American woodchuck develops chronic hepatitis and liver cancer after woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection, mirroring aspects of the natural history of the human hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, the cellular landscape of the woodchuck liver and the cell-level relevance of WHV infection to HBV infection is currently uncharacterized. Methods We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to generate an atlas of healthy woodchuck liver (63,389 cells, n=8) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (26,972 cells, n=7). Cell-specific and hepatic zonation gene signatures were validated using spatial transcriptomics (n=1). We employed our atlas to examine immune activation in stimulated precision cut-liver slices (PCLS) and disease-related pathway activation in chronic WHV infection (11,797 cells, n=3). We further employed our atlas to examine shared disease pathways between WHV infection and human HBV infection. Results Our atlas revealed woodchuck hepatic cellular diversity comparable to human and murine livers. Applying single-nucleus RNA-seq to PMA/ionomycin-stimulated precision cut liver slices revealed inflammation-associated activation signatures in T cell, myeloid and endothelial cell compartment. Finally, we describe intrahepatic T cells in chronic WHV hepatitis with both exhaustion and activation-associated signatures that resemble intrahepatic T cell genes signatures described in human chronic HBV. Conclusions We present a multi-omic atlas of healthy, diseased and ex vivo stimulated woodchuck liver. By identifying shared pathological processes between WHV and HBV infections, our findings reinforce the value of this preclinical model in translational research. This resource aims to advance studies on HBV pathogenesis and oncogenesis to speed the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Impact and Implications/Lay summary The liver plays important roles in metabolism, detoxification, and immune processes; liver transplantation is often the only treatment option for severe chronic liver diseases. Therefore, developing animal models that reflect human liver disease and can be studied throughout the disease course is crucial for the discovery of new treatment options. The woodchuck is an animal that develops chronic hepatitis and liver cancer after infection with woodchuck hepatitis virus, which models the human hepatitis type B virus infection (HBV) and associated hepatic carcinoma. However, our understanding of the cells that compose the woodchuck liver is limited, making it challenging to design and test cell-based therapeutics. In this study, we atlased the healthy and chronically infected woodchuck liver, found that liver cell types in woodchuck resemble those in humans, and employed the atlas to show similarities between WHV and HBV at the cell level, reinforcing the potential of WHV-infected woodchuck as a model for human HBV disease.

        <tr id="Access to the brain for treating neurological sequalae requires a craniotomy, which can be complicated by infection. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1-/- mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1-/- animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng-/- mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1-/- animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="Backgroud Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a newly identified tick-borne viral disease with a high mortality rate. Monocytes are known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SFTS, but the distinct subpopulations of monocytes associated with the disease progression and their roles in inflammatory responses remain unclear. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to explore the specific monocyte subpopulations correlated with the progression of SFTS and their involvement in inflammatory processes. Methods scRNA-seq analysis was conducted on isolated monocytes from seven SFTS patients, validated by cell identification through flow cytometry. Comparative analyses were performed using three normal monocyte samples from public databases. Bioinformatic tools including Cell Ranger, Seurat, Monocle 2, GSEA, and SCENIC were utilized to identify distinct cell populations and transcriptional patterns. Results Our results indicate that severe SFTS patients in the ICU exhibited a reduced proportion of circulating HLA-DR+CD14+ monocytes compared to non-severe hospitalized SFTS patients, indicating a dysfunctional immune response. Increased numbers of CD163+CD14+ monocytes in acute SFTS patients correlated with disease severity. CD163+CD14+ monocytes were identified as potential target cells for SFTSV infection. SFTSV infection could drive monocyte differentiation into the M2 phenotype, promoting virus persistence and disease advancement. Conclusion Our studies in SFTS patients have shown that monocytes are target cells for SFTSV. Notably, an expansion of CD163+CD14+ monocytes in SFTS has been shown to be associated with severe clinical disease. In addition, activated IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling in SFTS patients induced CD163+CD14+ monocyte expansion, which was recovered by tofacitinib treatment.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The naturally occurring mutation E484D in the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can render viral entry ACE2 independent and imdevimab resistant. Here, we investigated whether the cellular proteins ASGR1, DC-SIGN, and TMEM106B, which interact with the viral S protein, can contribute to these processes. Employing S protein-pseudotyped particles, we found that expression of ASGR1 or DC-SIGN jointly with TMEM106B allowed for robust entry of mutant E484D into otherwise non-susceptible cells, while this effect was not observed upon separate expression of the single proteins and upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WT). Furthermore, expression of ASGR1 or DC-SIGN conferred ACE2 independence and imdevimab resistance to entry of mutant E484D but not WT, and entry under those conditions was dependent on endogenous TMEM106B. These results suggest that engagement of certain cellular lectins can direct SARS-CoV-2 mutant E484D to an ACE2-independent, TMEM106B-dependent entry pathway that is not inhibited by imdevimab. IMPORTANCE The interaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein with the ACE2 receptor determines the viral cell tropism and is the key target of the neutralizing antibody response. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 with a single, naturally occurring mutation in the spike protein, E484D, can use the cellular lectins ASGR1 and DC-SIGN in conjunction with TMEM106B for ACE2-independent entry and evasion of therapeutic antibodies. These results suggest that engagement of cellular lectins might modulate target cell choice of SARS-CoV-2 and might allow evasion of certain neutralizing antibodies.">

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to significant global morbidity and mortality. While many patients recover, a subset experiences persistent pulmonary complications, including post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF), a condition characterized by irreversible lung scarring and impaired gas exchange. Several risk factors, such as advanced age, male sex, pre-existing lung disease, and severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, contribute to its development. Radiological assessments, particularly high-resolution computed tomography, reveal hallmark features such as reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and parenchymal bands, aiding in diagnosis. Current therapeutic strategies include corticosteroids, antifibrotic agents (pirfenidone, Nintedanib), and immunosuppressants, though no standardized treatment exists. Pulmonary rehabilitation and supplemental oxygen therapy offer symptomatic relief and improved functional outcomes. Future research explores novel agents, including buloxibutid, saracatinib, sirolimus, and resveratrol, as potential antifibrotic therapies. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and evolving treatment strategies for PCPF, emphasizing the need for continued research to optimize patient outcomes.

        <tr id="The first infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), occurred in December 2019. Within a single month, the disease reached other countries, spreading in a rapid and generalized manner worldwide to cause the COVID-19 pandemic. In Brazil, the number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 38 million. This study was conducted to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and investigate the immunogenic potential of synthetic peptides containing partial sequences of the main proteins (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins). In addition, we evaluated the ability of the antibodies to impair the interaction between the spike S1 protein and human ACE-2 protein, which is the main route of entry of the virus into host cells. By immunizing horses with synthetic peptides, we obtained hyperimmune sera with specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which were fragmented to release the F(ab’)2 portion that binds to the different SARS-CoV-2 proteins as a recombinant S1-protein and proteins from a viral lysate. The other F(ab’)2 samples also impaired the interaction between S1 protein and ACE-2 proteins, showing high potential to prevent viral spreading.">

        <tr id="White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have high value for research, conservation, agriculture, and recreation and might be key SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs. In November 2023, we sampled 15 female deer in a captive facility in Texas, USA. All deer had neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; respiratory swab samples from 11 deer were SARS-CoV-2–positive by quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and 1 deer also had a positive rectal swab sample. Six of the 11 respiratory swab samples yielded infectious virus; replication kinetics of most samples displayed lower growth 24–48 hours postinfection in vitro than Omicron lineages isolated from humans in Texas in the same period. Virus growth was similar between groups by 72 hours, suggesting no strong attenuation of deer-derived virus. All deer viruses clustered in XBB Omicron clade and demonstrated more mutations than expected compared with contemporaneous viruses in humans, suggesting that crossing the species barrier was accompanied by a high substitution rate.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with the development of fetal complications such as microcephaly. We have recently demonstrated that palmitoleate protects against ZIKV-induced apoptosis in placental trophoblasts. In the present study, we hypothesize that palmitoleate prevents ZIKV infection-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in neurons. Neurons were infected with 0.1-1 multiplicity of infection of recombinant MR766 or PRVABC59 strains of ZIKV for an hour followed by treatment of palmitoleate (100 µM-200 µM) for different post-infection time points. Apoptosis was measured by nuclear morphological changes, caspase 3/7 activity, and immunoblot analysis of pro-apoptotic mediators. Activation of ER stress markers and viral envelope levels were detected using qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Infectious virus particles were measured by using plaque assay. ZIKV infection to neuronal cells showed increased levels of pro-apoptotic markers like cleaved-PARP, cleaved caspase-3, Bim, and Puma, whereas decreased levels of anti-apoptotic markers such as Mcl-1, Bcl-1, and Bcl-xL. Further, we observed activation of three arms of ER stress namely: inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1), protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor (ATF6) pathways with ZIKV infection. Treatment of palmitoleate dramatically decreased ZIKV infection-induced increase in percent apoptotic nuclei and caspase 3/7 activity. Further, treatment of palmitoleate decreased cleaved PARP and PUMA protein expressions. Treatment of palmitoleate reduced ZIKV-induced ER stress activation as evidenced by decreased levels of phosphorylated forms of IRE1 and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha; decreased expressions of cleaved ATF6, spliced X-box associated protein 1 and C/EBP homologous protein compared to ZIKV infection alone. Further, treatment of palmitoleate attenuated ZIKV envelope levels and infectious titer in SH-SY5Y and primary fetal cortical neurons isolated from humanized STAT2 knockin mice. These data suggest that palmitoleate supplementation protects against ZIKV-induced neuronal ER stress, apoptosis and decreases Zika viral load thereby mitigates neuronal damage.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lyme arthritis (LA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection, with approximately 10-20% of patients developing antibiotic resistance. Macrophages in the synovial microenvironment play a crucial role in disease progression, but their precise regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Methods scRNA-seq data of synovial tissue from LA patients was obtained from the GEO database (GSE233850) and integrated with transcriptome data from our research team’s LA mouse model and the GSE125503 dataset. Multiple analytical strategies, including cell clustering, differential gene analysis, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, pseudotime trajectory analysis, and cell-cell communication analysis, were employed to systematically investigate macrophage characteristics in LA. In vitro experiments using RAW cell lines were conducted to validate the role of key genes in response to Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Results Through single-cell transcriptome analysis of 78,015 cells in the GSE233850 dataset, we identified and annotated 27,843 macrophages, further classifying them into 4 functional subgroups. Differential expression analysis revealed 387 macrophage-specific genes. Cell-cell communication network analysis showed that macrophages interact with other immune cells, including T cells and B cells, through multiple signaling pathways. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in biological processes such as inflammatory response regulation, pathogen recognition, and cytokine signaling. By integrating transcriptome data from our team’s LA mouse model and the GSE125503 dataset, we screened and validated three potential diagnostic marker genes (SIRPB1C, FABP5, and PEPD). In vitro experiments using the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line showed significant expression changes in these genes following Borrelia burgdorferi stimulation (P < 0.05). Conclusion This study provides the first systematic characterization of macrophage transcriptome in the LA synovial microenvironment, revealing their functional heterogeneity and identifying potential diagnostic markers, offering new targets for targeted therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background As the COVID‐19 pandemic nears resolution in 2024, the mechanisms by which SARS‐CoV‐2 and other viral infections induce spermatogenic dysfunction remain poorly understood. This review examines the mechanisms by which viral infections, particularly COVID‐19, disrupt spermatogenesis and highlights the implications for male reproductive health. While reports suggest that spermatogenic dysfunction caused by COVID‐19 is mild and transient, these findings may have broader applications in understanding and treating spermatogenic dysfunction caused by future viral infections. Methods The PubMed database was searched to identify original and review articles investigating the mechanisms by which viral infections, particularly SARS‐CoV‐2, contribute to spermatogenic dysfunction. Main Findings SARS‐CoV‐2 affects the testis through multiple mechanisms, including ACE2 receptor‐mediated entry, direct viral damage, inflammatory response, blood–testis barrier disruption, hormonal imbalance, oxidative stress, and impaired spermatogenesis. The combination of these factors can disrupt testicular function and highlights the complexity of the effects of COVID‐19 on male reproductive health. Conclusion COVID‐19 may disrupt spermatogenesis through direct testicular infection, systemic inflammation, hormonal disruption, and oxidative stress. Ongoing research, vaccination efforts, and clinical vigilance are essential to address these challenges and develop effective treatment and prevention strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has highlighted the role of hyperinflammatory states and cytokine storms in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, leading to extensive research into immunomodulatory drugs previously used for autoimmune diseases. Despite their promising effects, the mechanisms underlying their efficacy remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate these mechanisms through RNA-sequence data analysis.Table 1. Clinical characteristics of 30 COVID-19 patient cohort Methods Bulk RNA sequencing data from PBMC samples of COVID-19 patients was used to identify two sets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The first set was made by comparing COVID-19 patient data to healthy individuals using public datasets, while the second set involved DEGs from samples treated with immunomodulatory drugs versus untreated samples. Comparative analysis focused on genes with opposite expression changes, particularly those showing contrasting fold changes between COVID-19 and drug-treated samples.Figure 1. DEG array Results All COVID-19 patients met the criteria for severe or critical illness, requiring at least a high-flow nasal cannula. The median age was 66.5 years. Clinically, 46.7% underwent mechanical ventilation and the mortality rate stood at 46.7%. By arraying the table with all the samples combined from COVID-19 patient samples and immunomodulatory drug samples, DEGs that show opposite fold change signs were selected as having potential significance in COVID-19 pathways and being affected by immunomodulatory drugs. Specifically, 18 genes were upregulated in response to COVID-19 yet downregulated in immunomodulatory drug use, including key inflammatory and immune response genes such as FAP, RGS16, and IDO1. Conversely, 39 genes showed downregulation in response to COVID-19 but were upregulated in immunomodulatory drug use, featuring genes like DUSP1, TOB1, and RGMA.Table 2. List of genes found in DEG array Conclusion Through transcriptomic analysis and differential expression screening between COVID-19 and medication-treated samples, 57 were found to exhibit reversed fold changes in expression. Further investigation of these genes is expected. This research aims to uncover the shared biological mechanisms between autoimmune diseases and COVID-19, which could lead to effective drug repurposing strategies for treating COVID-19.

        <tr id="Germ-line deletion of a conserved enhancer (the Fms intrinsic regulatory element, FIRE) in the mouse Csf1r locus causes congenital absence of microglia. Homozygous FIRE deletion on a C57BL/6J background leads to perinatal lethality and hydrocephalus (HC) in surviving pups. We developed a congenic C57BL/6J line with defined regions of non-C57BL/6J genomic DNA, increased postnatal viability and reduced incidence of HC. Both perinatal lethality and HC were eliminated in F2 mice following outcross of the congenic line to CBA/J or BALBc/J backgrounds. To assess the impacts of microglial deficiency in postnatal neurodevelopment we analyzed deep total RNA-seq data from multiple brain regions of wild-type and Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mice. Aside from the loss of microglial-specific transcripts, we found no significant alterations in relative abundance of any cell-type or region-specific transcriptomic signature. Transcripts associated with endosome/lysosome function, which are enriched in microglia, were not affected, suggesting compensatory expression by other cell types. On the C57BL/6J x CBA/J F2 background, congenital absence of microglia did not affect motor activity, behavior or myelination up to 7 months of age but was associated with astrocytosis and calcification in the thalamus. In the congenic C57BL/6J Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mouse line, intraperitoneal transfer of wild-type bone marrow cells (BMT) at weaning led to complete repopulation of the brain with microglia-like cells without giving rise to monocytic intermediates. Our results suggest novel strategies for treatment of microglial deficiency.">

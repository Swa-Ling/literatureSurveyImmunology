        <tr id="Significance New severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants continue to emerge with differing effects on the lung, yet there is a lack of readily available, biologically relevant in vitro models for studying their impact on lung epithelial cells. We have harnessed our patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem cell–derived, multicell lung organoid model to investigate critical aspects of COVID-19, including viral tropism and routes of entry, lung-specific immune response, and a role for surfactant protein B in innate immunity, viral surveillance, cell survival, and inflammation. These findings can potentially revolutionize our understanding of the lung’s intrinsic response to viral infections, leading to innovative therapies.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory immune response. Monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been observed in monocytes of patients with COVID-19, but the mechanism and consequences of inflammasome activation require further investigation. In this study, we inoculated a macrophage-like THP-1 cell line, primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, and primary monocytes with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages does not rely on viral replication, receptor-mediated entry, or actin-dependent entry. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hNEC cultures without triggering the production of inflammasome cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. Importantly, these cytokines did not inhibit viral replication in hNEC cultures. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of primary monocytes led to inflammasome activation and induced a macrophage phenotype in these cells. Monocytic cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not from peripheral blood, of patients with COVID-19, showed evidence of inflammasome activation, expressed the proinflammatory marker CD11b, and displayed oxidative burst. These findings highlight the central role of activated macrophages, as a result of direct viral sensing, in COVID-19 and support the inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 as potential therapeutic strategies to reduce immunopathology without increasing viral replication.


IMPORTANCE
Inflammasome activation is associated with severe COVID-19. The impact of inflammasome activation on viral replication and mechanistic details of this activation are not clarified. This study advances our understanding of the role of inflammasome activation in macrophages by identifying TLR2, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 as dependent factors in this activation. Further, it highlights that SARS-CoV-2 inflammasome activation is not a feature of nasal epithelial cells but rather activation of bystander macrophages in the airway. Finally, we demonstrate that two pro inflammatory cytokines produced by inflammasome activation, IL-18 and IL-1β, do not restrict viral replication and are potential targets to ameliorate pathological inflammation in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Emerging evidence shows increased humoral response post-omicron surge, but research on T cell responses is limited. This study investigated the durability, magnitude, and breadth of SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific T cell responses in 216 two-dose vaccinated individuals pre- and post-omicron surge. Post-surge samples showed enhanced T cell responses, indicating widespread asymptomatic exposure to omicron. Further analysis of 105 individuals with multiple exposures to SARS-CoV-2 through boosters or infections showed that post-omicron, two-dose vaccinated individuals had T cell responses comparable to those of COVID-19 convalescents or boosted individuals. Additionally, we report cross-reactive T cell responses against omicron sub-variants, including BA2.86, remained strong, with preserved frequencies of spike-specific stem-cell-like memory T cells. In silico prediction indicates that mutated epitopes of JN.1 and KP.2 retain over 95.6% of their HLA binding capability. Overall, our data suggests that T cell responses are sustained, enhanced, and cross-reactive against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants following symptomatic or asymptomatic omicron infection.">

        <tr id="The severity of COVID-19 is linked to excessive inflammation. Neutrophils represent a critical arm of the innate immune response and are major mediators of inflammation, but their role in COVID-19 pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We conducted transcriptomic profiling of neutrophils obtained from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, as well as from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, in comparison to non-infected healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the inflammasome formation potential in neutrophils from patients and mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), consisting mainly of mature neutrophils, revealed a striking type I interferon (IFN-I) gene signature in severe COVID-19 patients, contrasting with mild COVID-19 and healthy controls. Notably, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) from severe COVID-19 patients exhibited an immature neutrophil phenotype and lacked this IFN-I signature. Moreover, PMNs from severe COVID-19 patients showed heightened nigericin-induced caspase1 activation, but reduced responsiveness to exogenous inflammasome priming. Furthermore, IFN-I emerged as a priming stimulus for neutrophil inflammasomes. These findings suggest a potential role for neutrophil inflammasomes in driving inflammation during severe COVID-19. Altogether, these findings open promising avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate the pathological processes associated with the disease.">

Comparisons based on vaccination status alone and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were performed. A second cohort of vaccinated Omicron patients were evaluated acutely and at ten months.Acutely, unvaccinated patients manifested overexpression of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory responses, while vaccinated patients exhibited adaptive immune responses without significant inflammation. At three and ten months, only unvaccinated patients had diminished but sustained inflammatory (C3b, CCL15, IL17RE) and immune responses (DEFA5,TREM1). Both groups had underexpression of pathways essential for cellular function, signaling, and angiogenesis (AKT1, MAPK14, HSPB1) across phases. Unsupervised clustering, based on protein expression, identified four groups of patients with variable vaccination rates demonstrating that additional clinical factors influence the plasma proteome. The proteome of vaccinated Omicron patients did not differ from vaccinated pre-Omicron patients.Vaccination attenuates the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection across phases. However, at ten months after symptom onset, changes in the plasma proteome persist in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, which may be relevant to post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections associated with post-acute infection syndromes.">

Here, we describe the adaptation of a human alveolus microphysiological system (MPS) model consisting of primary human alveolar epithelial and lung microvascular endothelial cells to study infection with SARS-CoV-2 at Biosafety Level 3 facility. This infection model recapitulates breathing-like stretch and culture of epithelial cells at the air–liquid interface and resulted in clinically relevant cytopathic effects including cell rounding of alveolar type 2 cells and disruption of the tight junction protein occludin. Viral replication was confirmed by immunocytochemical nucleocapsid staining in the epithelium and increased shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus within 2 days post-infection, associated with changes in innate host immune responses. Together, these data demonstrate that, under the experimental conditions used in this work, this human alveolus MPS chip can successfully model SARS-CoV-2 infection of human alveolar lung cells.">

In this pilot study, we exposed two pigtail macaques (PTMs) chronically infected with SIVmac239, exhibiting from very low to no CD4 T cells across all compartments, to SARS-CoV-2. We monitored the disease progression, viral replication, and evolution, and compared these outcomes with SIV-naïve PTMs infected with SARS-CoV-2. No overt signs of COVID-19 disease were observed in either animal, and the SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and evolution in the SIVmac239 PTMs were indistinguishable from those in the SIV-naïve PTMs in all sampled mucosal sites. However, the single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells revealed an infiltration of functionally inert monocytes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Critically, neither of the SIV-infected PTMs mounted detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses nor anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding or neutralizing antibodies. Thus, HIV-induced immunodeficiency alone may not be sufficient to drive the emergence of novel viral variants but may remove the ability of infected individuals to mount adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is characterized by its high transmissibility, which has caused a worldwide epidemiological event. Yet, it turns ominous once the disease progression degenerates into severe pneumonia and sepsis, presenting a horrendous lethality. To elucidate the alveolar immune or inflammatory landscapes of Omicron critical-ill patients, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with critical pneumonia caused by Omicron infection, and analyzed the correlation between the clinical severity scores and different immune cell subpopulations. In the BALF of Omicron critical patients, the alveolar violent myeloid inflammatory environment was determined. ISG15+ neutrophils and CXCL10+ macrophages, both expressed the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), were negatively correlated with clinical pulmonary infection score, while septic CST7+ neutrophils and inflammatory VCAN+ macrophages were positively correlated with sequential organ failure assessment. The percentages of ISG15+ neutrophils were associated with more protective alveolar epithelial cells, and may reshape CD4+ T cells to the exhaustive phenotype, thus preventing immune injuries. The CXCL10+ macrophages may promote plasmablast/plasma cell survival and activation as well as the production of specific antibodies. As compared to the previous BALF scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 wild-type/Alpha critical patients, the subsets of neutrophils and macrophages with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features presented obvious distinctions, suggesting an immune disparity in Omicron variants. Overall, this study provides a BALF single-cell atlas of Omicron critical patients, and suggests that alveolar interferon-responsive neutrophils and macrophages may extricate SARS-CoV-2 Omicron critical patients from the nasty fate of sepsis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) preferentially infects the respiratory tract; however, several studies have implicated a multi-organ involvement. Hepatic dysfunctions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been increasingly recognized and described to correlate with disease severity. To elucidate molecular factors that could contribute towards hepatic infection, we concentrated on microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that modulate various cellular processes and which are reported to be differentially regulated during liver injury. We aimed to study the infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) with SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the potential of miRNAs for modulating viral infection.


METHODS
We analysed liver autopsies from a coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-positive cohort for the presence of viral RNA using Nanopore sequencing. PHH were used for the infection with SARS-CoV-2. The candidate miRNAs targeting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were identified using in silico approaches. To discover the potential regulatory mechanism, transfection experiments, qRT-PCRs, western blots and luciferase reporter assays were performed.


RESULTS
We could detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19-positive liver autopsies. We show that PHH express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and can be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulting in robust replication. Transfection of selected miRNA mimics reduced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression and SARS-CoV-2 burden in PHH. In silico and biochemical analyses supported a potential direct binding of miR-141-3p to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.


CONCLUSION
We confirm that PHH are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate selected miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and/or the viral genome reduce viral loads. These data provide novel insights into hepatic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and associated dysfunctions in COVID-19.">

Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies, vaccines, and alternative therapies that were urgently released during the pandemic.

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has confirmed that the ability to rapidly mutate may be extremely beneficial for a virus. Not long after the first wave, new variants emerged with altered infectivity, disease severity, and mortality. These new strains most notably had numerous mutations of the spike (S) protein, a surface protein responsible for binding to and entering the host cell. The Delta and Omicron strains demonstrated increased immune evasion and improved binding affinity to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This study examines the ability of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 IgG to bind Delta and Omicron antigens, as well as their functional binding capabilities to two different S-ACE2 complexes. Twenty SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from patients who had recovered from infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in the first wave of COVID-19 and 10 pre-pandemic control samples were studied. SARS-CoV-2 exposed patients showed significantly higher levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD (p < 0.001), N protein (p < 0.001), and Omicron spike variant (p = 0.01), but not to Delta spike variant (p = 0.966) when compared with controls. Furthermore, patient samples showed significantly greater inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 binding (p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Conversely, there was no correlation between the binding inhibition of S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 receptor. This study shows there is considerable cross-reactivity of IgG generated by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Delta and Omicron variants.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infects via the respiratory tract, but COVID-19 includes an array of non-respiratory symptoms, among them gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as vomiting and diarrhea. Here we investigated the GI pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in rhesus macaques and humans. Macaques experienced mild infection with USA-WA1/2020 and shed viral RNA in the respiratory tract and stool, including subgenomic RNA indicative of replication in the GI tract. Intestinal immune cell populations were disturbed, with significantly fewer proliferating (Ki67+) jejunal B cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques than uninfected ones. Modest translocation of bacteria/bacterial antigen was observed across the colonic epithelium, with a corresponding significant increase in plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) that may be induced by LPS. Human plasma demonstrated significant decreases in interleukin (IL)-6 and sCD14 upon recovery from COVID-19, suggesting resolution of inflammation and response to translocated bacteria. sCD14 significantly positively correlated with zonulin, an indicator of gut barrier integrity, and IL-6. These results demonstrate that GI perturbations such as microbial translocation can occur in even mild SARS-CoV-2 infections and may contribute to the COVID-19 inflammatory state.IMPORTANCEThis study investigates gastrointestinal (GI) barrier disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infections and how it may contribute to disease. We observed bacteria or bacterial products crossing from the colon interior (the lumen) to the lamina propria during SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. Bacteria/bacterial products are tolerated in the lumen but may induce immune responses if they translocate to the lamina propria. We also observed a significant increase in soluble CD14, which is associated with an immune response to bacterial products. In addition, we observed that humans recovering from COVID-19 experienced a significant decrease in soluble CD14, as well as the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 and sCD14 correlated significantly across macaque and human samples. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in GI barrier disruption that permits microbial translocation and a corresponding immune response. These findings could aid in developing interventions to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal outbreaks of other respiratory viruses highlight the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals to treat respiratory tract infections. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a key component of innate immune signaling and plays a critical role in protection of the host against viral infections. Previously the STING agonist diABZI-4, a diamidobenzimidazole-based compound, demonstrated protection against SARS-CoV-2 both in vitro and in vivo. However, its broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other respiratory viruses in human airway epithelial cells, which are the primary targets of these infections, is not well established. In this study, we demonstrated that diABZI-4 stimulated robust innate immune responses protecting lung cells against a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), common cold coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, human rhinovirus (HRV), and human parainfluenza virus. diABZI-4 was highly active in physiologically relevant human airway epithelial tissues grown at the air-liquid interface, blocking replication of IAV, SARS-CoV-2, and HRV in these tissues. Furthermore, treatment of macrophages with diABZI-4 resulted in the secretion of cytokines that protected the primary airway epithelial cells from IAV infection. Despite the promising in vitro pan-antiviral activity, intranasal administration of diABZI-4 in mice provided early, but not sustained, inhibition of IAV replication in the lungs. These data highlight the complexities of the relationship between timing of STING agonist-driven inflammatory responses and viral replication dynamics, emphasizing the development challenge posed by STING agonists as potential therapeutics against respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Coronaviruses constitute a significant threat to the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2, is a highly pathogenic human coronavirus that has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It has led to a global viral outbreak with an exceptional spread and a high death toll, highlighting the need for effective antiviral strategies. 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), the main protease in SARS-CoV-2, plays an indispensable role in the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle by cleaving the viral polyprotein to produce 11 individual non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication. 3CLpro is one of two proteases that function to produce new viral particles. It is a highly conserved cysteine protease with identical structural folds in all known human coronaviruses. Inhibitors binding with high affinity to 3CLpro will prevent the cleavage of viral polyproteins, thus impeding viral replication. Multiple strategies have been implemented to screen for inhibitors against 3CLpro, including peptide-like and small molecule inhibitors that covalently and non-covalently bind the active site, respectively. In addition, allosteric sites of 3CLpro have been identified to screen for small molecules that could make non-competitive inhibitors of 3CLpro. In essence, this review serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the structural intricacies and functional dynamics of 3CLpro, emphasizing key findings that elucidate its role as the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the review is a critical resource in recognizing the advancements in identifying and developing 3CLpro inhibitors as effective antiviral strategies against COVID-19, some of which are already approved for clinical use in COVID-19 patients.">

These immune changes in T lymphocytes are closely associated with disease progression, but the specific mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further investigation. This paper reviewed the changes in the number and function of T cells in respiratory viral infections, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2, and summarized related therapeutic explorations. We believe that improving and enhancing the number and function of T lymphocytes in infected hosts is a promising strategy for the treatment of respiratory viral infections, although more systematic and in-depth scientific research is still needed.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever, is an emerging respiratory disease caused by soil dwelling fungi of the Coccidioides genus that is expected to spread from the southwest into the central U.S. by 2050. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the other 40% of patients experience a range of symptoms, from self-limiting pneumonia to life-threatening disseminated disease. The immunological events that underlie the progression to severe disease remain under defined. Here, we probed the early immune response to Coccidioides using a high dose of an attenuated strain of C. posadasii in a mouse model of infection coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing. At 24 hours post-infection, robust immune infiltration is detected in the lung, marked by high levels of inflammatory PD-L1+ neutrophils and fungal-contact dependent pro-fibrotic Spp1+ macrophages. These findings elucidate the early dynamics of the host response to Coccidioides and provide a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the lung. Importance By examining early immune dynamics in the lungs, we uncover critical insights into how myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, are recruited and differentiated during Coccidioides infection. The discovery of specific immune cell subsets, such as PD-L1+ neutrophils and Spp1+ macrophages, which are associated with inflammation and fibrosis, highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interactions that occur during Coccidioides infection, offering valuable directions for developing more effective treatments and preventive strategies against this increasingly prevalent disease.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against β-coronaviruses (β-CoVs), a family of viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2. Viral sensing via pattern recognition receptors triggers inflammation and cell death, which are essential components of the innate immune response that facilitate viral clearance. However, excessive activation of the innate immune system and inflammatory cell death can result in uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in cytokine storm and pathology. PANoptosis, innate immune, inflammatory cell death initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes, has been implicated in the pathology of viral infections. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PANoptosis in response to β-CoV infection is critical for identifying new therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease severity. In the current study, we analyzed findings from a cell death-based CRISPR screen with archetypal β-CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as the trigger to characterize host molecules required for inflammatory cell death. As a result, we identified SMARCA4, a chromatin regulator, as a putative host factor required for PANoptosis in response to MHV. Furthermore, we observed that gRNA-mediated deletion of Smarca4 inhibited MHV-induced PANoptotic cell death in macrophages. These findings have potential translational and clinical implications for the advancement of treatment strategies for β-CoVs and other infections.">

        <tr id="The unprecedented research effort associated with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) included several extensive proteomic studies that identified host proteins that interact with individual viral gene products. However, in most cases, the consequences of those virus–host interactions for virus replication were not experimentally pursued, which is a necessary step in determining whether the interactions represent pro- or anti-viral events. One putative interaction commonly identified in multiple studies was between the host adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) subunit B1 (AP3B1) and the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E). AP3B1 is one subunit of AP-3 required for the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles (LROs), and its function impacts important disease processes including inflammation and vascular health. Thus, interactions between AP3B1 and SARS-CoV-2 might influence the clinical outcomes of infection. To determine if AP3B1 has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, we first confirmed the interaction in virus-infected cells using immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). AP3B1 is required by multiple viruses to aid in the replication cycle and therefore may be a therapeutic target. However, we found that the overexpression of AP3B1 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas the siRNA-mediated depletion of AP3B1 increased the release of infectious virus, suggesting an antiviral role for AP3B1. Together, our findings suggest that AP3B1 is an intrinsic barrier to SARS-CoV-2 replication through interactions with the viral E protein. Our work justifies further investigations of LRO trafficking in SARS-CoV-2 target cells and their role in viral pathogenesis.">

Although studies have shown olfactory and hematogenous invasion into the CNS, coinciding with neuroinflammation, little attention has been paid to susceptibility of the PNS to infection or to its contribution to CNS invasion. Here we show that sensory and autonomic neurons in the PNS are susceptible to productive infection with SARS-CoV-2 and outline physiological and molecular mechanisms mediating neuroinvasion. Our infection of K18-hACE2 mice, wild-type mice, and golden Syrian hamsters, as well as primary peripheral sensory and autonomic neuronal cultures, show viral RNA, proteins, and infectious virus in PNS neurons, satellite glial cells, and functionally connected CNS tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate, in vitro, that neuropilin-1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 neuronal entry. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly invades the PNS prior to viremia, establishes a productive infection in peripheral neurons, and results in sensory symptoms often reported by COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The first approved vaccines for human use against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are nanotechnology-based. Although they are modular, rapidly produced, and can reduce disease severity, the currently available vaccines are restricted in preventing infection, stressing the global demand for novel preventive vaccine technologies. Bearing this in mind, we set out to develop a flexible nanovaccine platform for nasal administration to induce mucosal immunity, which is fundamental for optimal protection against respiratory virus infection. The next-generation multiepitope nanovaccines co-deliver immunogenic peptides, selected by an immunoinformatic workflow, along with adjuvants and regulators of the PD-L1 expression. As a case study, we focused on SARS-CoV-2 peptides as relevant antigens to validate the approach. This platform can evoke both local and systemic cellular- and humoral-specific responses against SARS-CoV-2. This led to the secretion of immunoglobulin A (IgA), capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, following a heterologous immunization strategy. Considering the limitations of the required cold chain distribution for current nanotechnology-based vaccines, it is shown that the lyophilized nanovaccine is stable for long-term at room temperature and retains its in vivo efficacy upon reconstitution.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to life-threatening clinical manifestations. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at higher risk for severe courses of COVID-19. So far, however, there are hardly any strategies for predicting the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CVD patients at hospital admission. Thus, we investigated whether this prediction is achievable by prospectively analysing the blood immunophenotype of 94 nonvaccinated participants, including uninfected and acutely SARS-CoV-2-infected CVD patients and healthy donors, using a 36-colour spectral flow cytometry panel. Unsupervised data analysis revealed little differences between healthy donors and CVD patients, whereas the distribution of the cell populations changed dramatically in SARS-CoV-2-infected CVD patients. The latter had more mature NK cells, activated monocyte subsets, central memory CD4+ T cells, and plasmablasts but fewer dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, innate lymphoid cells, and CD8+ T-cell subsets. Moreover, we identified an immune signature characterised by CD161+ T cells, intermediate effector CD8+ T cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells that is predictive for CVD patients with a severe course of COVID-19. Thus, intensified immunophenotype analyses can help identify patients at risk of severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, improving clinical outcomes through specific treatment.">

        <tr id="Understanding the pathophysiology of long COVID is one of the most intriguing challenges confronting contemporary medicine. Despite observations recently made in the relevant molecular, cellular, and physiological domains, it is still difficult to say whether the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 directly correspond to the consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This work hypothesizes that neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) production are at the interconnection of three positive feedback loops which are initiated in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and which involve inflammation, immunothrombosis, and autoimmunity. This phenomenon could be favored by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 may directly bind and penetrate neutrophils. The ensuing strong neutrophil stimulation leads to a progressive amplification of an exacerbated and uncontrolled NETs production, potentially persisting for months beyond the acute phase of infection. This continuous self-stimulation of neutrophils leads, in turn, to systemic inflammation, micro-thromboses, and the production of autoantibodies, whose significant consequences include the persistence of endothelial and multiorgan damage, and vascular complications.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) remain a significant global cause of mortality and disability. Viruses constitute a substantial proportion of LRTI cases, with their pandemic potential posing a latent threat. After the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the resurgence of other respiratory viruses, including Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus responsible for LRTI has been observed especially in susceptible populations.


AREAS COVERED
This review details the inflammatory mechanisms associated with three primary respiratory viruses: SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The focus will be on elucidating the activation of inflammatory pathways, understanding cellular contributions to inflammation, exploring the role of interferon and induced cell death in the response to these pathogens and detailing viral evasion mechanisms. Furthermore, the distinctive characteristics of each virus will be explained.


EXPERT OPINION
The study of viral pneumonia, notably concerning SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and RSV, offers critical insights into infectious and inflammatory mechanisms with wide-ranging implications. Addressing current limitations, such as diagnostic accuracy and understanding host-virus interactions, requires collaborative efforts and investment in technology. Future research holds promise for uncovering novel therapeutic targets, exploring host microbiome roles, and addressing long-term sequelae. Integrating advances in molecular biology and technology will shape the evolving landscape of viral pneumonia research, potentially enhancing global public health outcomes.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable respiratory virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Since its emergence in the early 2000s, SARS has posed significant public health challenges and continues to be a concern. This review provides an overview of current treatment strategies for SARS-CoV and explores the potential utility of herbal molecules in combating this viral infection. The primary treatment approach for SARS-CoV has historically centered on supportive care, which includes oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and antipyretic medications to manage symptoms. However, with the ongoing advancement of medical research and our evolving understanding of the virus, several antiviral drugs have been developed and repurposed to target SARS-CoV. Recent developments in the field of herbal medicine have drawn attention to the potential efficacy of natural compounds in the management of viral infections, including SARS. Herbal molecules, characterized by their diverse bioactive constituents, exhibit antiviral properties that could be harnessed to mitigate SARS symptoms and inhibit viral replication. Ocimum sanctum, Tinospora cordifolia, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Panax ginseng, and Aloe vera have been identified for their immunomodulatory effects. This review highlights promising herbal molecules such as quercetin, and curcumin, which have demonstrated antiviral effects in–vitro and in some preclinical studies. While current treatment strategies for SARS primarily rely on supportive care and antiviral medications, the exploration of herbal molecules presents an exciting avenue for potential adjunctive therapies. Further research is required to validate their efficacy, safety profiles, and mechanisms of action. A holistic approach that combines conventional medicine with herbal remedies may offer new insights into the treatment of SARS and other viral respiratory illnesses.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) persist in many patients for weeks and months after recovery from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent evidence suggests that pathological changes in skeletal muscle may contribute significantly to ongoing pain and fatigue, particularly post-exertional malaise. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PASC-related fatigue by examining skeletal muscle function and circulating factors in affected individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of patients with fatigue-associated PASC who had experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and content in PASC participants compared to healthy controls. This lower respiratory capacity was accompanied by markedly elevated circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (sIL2R), a T cell-specific receptor. In vitro experiments demonstrated that sIL2R directly impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces mitochondrial complex III subunit protein levels in cultured muscle cells. These findings suggest a mechanism linking systemic immune dysregulation to muscle-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC. This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of PASC identifying sIL2R as a promising therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial deficits in PASC-related fatigue and opening avenues for developing targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Despite that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been controlled, it has affected a large proportion of the population, raising some concerns about potential sequelae in men at reproductive age. To contribute to the clarification of this issue, we performed a retrospective study comparing semen parameters values before and after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large cohort of infertile men, compared to a control group that did not undergo SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wilcoxon test on paired samples and general linear regression model showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a detrimental effect on semen volume values (p < 0.005). However, semen volume seems to be significantly lower only during the first spermatogenic cycle after SARS-COV-2 infection (p < 0.005) and mainly in unvaccinated patients (p < 0.05). In addition, we detected alterations in progressive motility in patients infected with the alpha SARS-COV-2 strain (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our results show that although SARS-CoV-2 has a small effect on semen volume and sperm motility in infertile men, depending on the infectious strain or vaccination status, pre-infection values of semen parameters appear to be restored over one spermatogenic cycle after infection.">

        <tr id="Virus-infected cells secrete exosomes and other extracellular vesicles which could deliver viral components, including structural proteins and viral derived-ribonucleic acids to other cells. Released extracellular vesicles carry virus-specific receptors that increase the sensitivity of the target cells to viral infection. Exosomes may contribute to the systemic spreading of SARS-CoV-2 virus by transferring essential receptors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and CD9 that promote the ability of the virus to dock into the target cells. Subsequently, the SARS-CoV-2 virus might also enter into the exosomal pathway to use this system for packaging their components into exosomes for secretion. This study suggests that one of the potential explanations for the relapse and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection could be an endocytic transport pathway related to the secretion of COVID-19-loaded extracellular vesicles.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. Many expect future coronavirus introductions into the human population. Hence, it is essential to understand the basic biology of these viruses. In natural infection, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein is co-expressed with all other viral proteins, which modify cellular compartments to maximize virion assembly. By comparison, most of S is degraded when the protein is expressed in isolation, as in current molecular vaccines. To probe the maturation pathway of S, we redirected its maturation by fusing S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. CD81 is a defining constituent of extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes. EVs are generated in large numbers by all cells, extruded into blood and lymph, and transfer cargo between cells and systemically (estimated 1012 EVs per mL plasma). EVs, like platelets, can be transfused between unrelated donors. When fusing the proline-stabilized form of strain Delta S into the flexible, large extracellular loop of CD81 rather than being degraded in the lysosome, S was extruded into EVs. CD81-S fusion containing EVs were produced in large numbers and could be isolated to high purity. Purified CD81::S EVs bound ACE2, and S displayed on individual EV was observed by cryogenic electron microscopy (EM). The CD81::S-fusion EVs were non-toxic and elicited an anti-S trimer and anti-RBD antibody response in mice. This report shows a design path to maximize viral glycoprotein assembly and release without relying on the co-expression of potentially pathogenic nonstructural viral proteins. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. To understand the maturation pathway of S, we fused S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. The resulting molecule is secreted in extracellular vesicles and induces antibodies in mice. This may be a general design path for viral glycoprotein vaccines.">

        <tr id="Significance Early in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, severe multisystem inflammatory responses were observed in children. Symptoms of this condition resembled superantigen poisoning, which results in indiscriminate T cell activation via antigen-independent binding of superantigens to T cell receptors (TCRs). Sequence similarities between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a bacterial superantigen led to the hypothesis that the spike protein could act as a superantigen. Although supported by structural modeling, this hypothesis has not yet found direct experimental support. Here, we studied the potential interaction of the spike protein with TCRs. With orthogonal biochemical and biological methods, we did not detect a spike-TCR molecular interaction. We conclude that it is unlikely that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein engages nonspecifically with TCRs or has superantigenic character.">

        <tr id="Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes widespread changes in epigenetic modifications and chromatin architecture in the host cell. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) plays an important role in driving these changes. Previously thought to be primarily involved in host translation shutoff and cellular mRNA degradation, nsp1 has now been shown to be a truly multifunctional protein that affects host gene expression at multiple levels. The functions of nsp1 are surprisingly diverse and include not only the downregulation of cellular mRNA translation and stability, but also the inhibition of mRNA export from the nucleus, the suppression of host immune signaling, and, most recently, the epigenetic regulation of host gene expression. In this review, we first summarize the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-induced changes in epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure. We then focus on the role of nsp1 in epigenetic reprogramming, with a particular emphasis on the silencing of immune-related genes. Finally, we discuss potential molecular mechanisms underlying the epigenetic functions of nsp1 based on evidence from SARS-CoV-2 interactome studies.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a significant public health threat, particularly in children and older adults, with high mortality rates. Some of these pathogens are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza viruses (IV), human parvovirus B19 (B19V), and human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1). These viruses cause various respiratory symptoms, including cough, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Notably, these viruses can also impact the central nervous system (CNS), leading to acute manifestations such as seizures, encephalopathies, encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and long-term complications. The precise mechanisms by which these viruses affect the CNS are not fully understood. Glial cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes within the CNS, play pivotal roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and regulating immune responses. Exploring how these cells interact with viral pathogens, such as hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IVs, B19V, and HBoV1, offers crucial insights into the significant impact of respiratory viruses on the CNS. This review article examines hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IV, B19V, and HBoV1 interactions with microglia and astrocytes, shedding light on potential neurological consequences.">

Advancement of proteomic and metabolomic studies now allows deeper investigation of alterations to cellular metabolism, autophagic processes and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, while computational biology and machine learning have advanced methodologies of predicting virus–host gene and protein interactions. Particular focus is given to the interaction between viral genes and proteins with mitochondrial function and that of the innate immune system. Finally, the authors hypothesise that viral persistence may be a function of mitochondrial involvement in the sequestration of viral genetic material. While further work is necessary to understand the mechanisms definitively, a number of studies now point to the resolution of questions regarding the pathogenesis of PASC.">

Here, we utilized the GeoMx spatial multi-omics platform to analyze immune cell changes in COVID-19 pancreatic autopsy samples, revealing an accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages. Single cell RNA-seq analysis of human islets exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or Coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) viruses identified activation of proinflammatory macrophages and β cell pyroptosis. To distinguish viral versus proinflammatory macrophage-mediated β cell pyroptosis, we developed human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived vascularized macrophage-islet (VMI) organoids. VMI organoids exhibited enhanced marker expression and function in both β cells and endothelial cells compared to separately cultured cells. Notably, proinflammatory macrophages within VMI organoids induced β cell pyroptosis. Mechanistic investigations highlighted TNFSF12-TNFRSF12A involvement in proinflammatory macrophage-mediated β cell pyroptosis. This study established hPSC- derived VMI organoids as a valuable tool for studying immune cell-mediated host damage and uncovered mechanism of β cell damage during viral exposure.">

However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces pneumonia and acute respiratory failure in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with inborn errors of immunity to type I interferon (IFN-I). The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies widely, ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to life-threatening illness and organ failure, with a higher incidence in men than in women. Approximately 3 to 5% of critical COVID-19 patients under 60 and a smaller percentage of elderly patients exhibit genetic defects in IFN-I production, including X-chromosome-linked TLR7 and autosomal TLR3 deficiencies. Around 15 to 20% of cases over 70 years old, and a smaller percentage of younger patients, present with preexisting autoantibodies neutralizing type I interferons. Additionally, innate errors affecting the control of the response to type I interferon have been associated with pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Several studies have described rare errors of immunity, such as XIAP deficiency, CYBB, SOCS1, OAS1/2, and RNASEL, as underlying factors in MIS-C susceptibility. However, further investigations in expanded patient cohorts are needed to validate these findings and pave the way for new genetic approaches to MIS-C. This review aims to present recent evidence from the scientific literature on genetic and immunological abnormalities predisposing individuals to critical SARS-CoV-2 infection through IFN-I. We will also discuss multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Understanding the immunological mechanisms and pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 may inform personalized patient care and population protection strategies against future serious viral infections.">

        <tr id="The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and enduring impact, resulting in substantial loss of life. The scientific community has responded unprecedentedly by investigating various aspects of the crisis, particularly focusing on the acute phase of COVID-19. The roles of the viral load, cytokines, and chemokines during the acute phase and in the context of patients who experienced enduring symptoms upon infection, so called Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 or PASC, have been studied extensively. Here, in this review, we offer a virologist’s perspective on PASC, highlighting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, cytokines, and chemokines in different organs of patients across the full clinical spectrum of acute-phase disease. We underline that the probability of severe or critical disease progression correlates with increased viral load levels detected in the upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT), and plasma. Acute-phase viremia is a clear, although not unambiguous, predictor of PASC development. Moreover, both the quantity and diversity of functions of cytokines and chemokines increase with acute-phase disease severity. Specific cytokines remain or become elevated in the PASC phase, although the driving factor of ongoing inflammation found in patients with PASC remains to be investigated. The key findings highlighted in this review contribute to a further understanding of PASC and their differences and overlap with acute disease.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. 350,000 cases are reported annually in the U.S., although that number is expected to increase as climate change expands fungal geographic range. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the symptomatic 40% are often misdiagnosed due to similarities with bronchitis or pneumonia. A small subset of infection progress to severe illness, necessitating a better understanding of immune responses during lethal infection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we characterized lung responses during Coccidioides infection. We identified monocyte-derived Spp1-expressing macrophages as potential mediators of tissue remodeling and fibrosis, marked by high expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory transcripts. These macrophages showed elevated TGF-β and IL-6 signaling, pathways involved in fibrosis pathogenesis. Additionally, we observed significant neutrophil infiltration and defective lymphocyte responses, indicating severe adaptive immunity dysregulation in lethal, acute infection. These findings enhance our understanding of Coccidioides infection and suggest new therapeutic targets. Importance: Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, which is prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. With climate change potentially expanding the geographic range of this fungus, understanding the immune responses during severe infections is crucial. Our study used advanced techniques to analyze lung responses during Coccidioides infection, identifying specific immune cells that may contribute to tissue damage and fibrosis. These findings provide new insights into the disease mechanisms and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention, which could improve outcomes for patients suffering from severe Valley Fever.">

We have previously shown that innate immune cells play a critical role in controlling SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the innate immune response during breakthrough infections, we modeled breakthrough infections by challenging low-dose vaccinated mice with a vaccine-mismatched SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. We found that low-dose vaccinated infected mice had a 2-log reduction in lung viral burden, but increased immune cell infiltration in the lung parenchyma, characterized by monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and eosinophils. Single cell RNA-seq revealed viral RNA was highly associated with eosinophils that corresponded to a unique IFN-γ biased signature. Antibody-mediated depletion of eosinophils in vaccinated mice resulted in increased virus replication and dissemination in the lungs, demonstrating that eosinophils in the lungs are protective during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. These results highlight the critical role for the innate immune response in vaccine mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Novel coronavirus disease 2019, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, initiate humoral and cellular immune responses against diverse virus antigens. The assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific is mainly carried out in routine practice by determining specific immunoglobulins. However, high variability in S-protein structure in new genovariants of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the lack of correlation between specific antibodies and CD8+ T-lymphocytes underlie false negative responses, and mass assessment of cellular immunity is complicated due to the complexity of applying ELISPOT and cytofluorometry techniques. To solve this issue, a diagnostic method was developed for assessing SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immune response, which is based on a skin test followed by evaluating a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction involving antigen-specific memory T-lymphocytes. A diagnostic preparation CoronaDerm-PS is based on Cord_PS, which is a hybrid recombinant protein consisting of parts of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, M, N, E. The specific activity of this chimeric antigen was analyzed in cultured T-lymphocyte activation test by assessing interferon-γ production using cytofluorometry. To investigate the chimeric antigen specific activity, a preclinical safety study with CoronaDerm-PS preparation in experimental animals was conducted. A dose-dependent developing skin reaction was observed in 90–100% of guinea pigs vaccinated by EpiVacCorona, CoviVac, Gam-COVID-Vac, which confirms a potential for assessing post-vaccination cellular immunity using CoronaDerm-PS preparation. Upon this, the presence of functionally active T-cell-antigenic epitopes in the recombinant polypeptide allows to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific response illustrated by detected response after Gam-COVID-Vac (S-protein) and EpiVacCorona (N-protein) vaccination. Thus, a skin test based on CoronaDerm-PS preparation may be a promising diagnostic tool for rapid mass screening requiring no specialized laboratory equipment for assessing populational SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Such a test is distinguished by advantages such as ease of analysis, high specificity and sensitivity. The final decision-making on using this test in a real-world practice may achieved after conducting further clinical safety and effectiveness trials.">

        <tr id="Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of S1 and receptor binding domain protein-specific B cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations. This study aimed to evaluate the role and developmental pathway of atypical memory B cells (MBCs) in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The results revealed a proinflammatory signature across B cell subsets associated with disease severity, as evidenced by the upregulation of genes such as GADD45B, MAP3K8, and NFKBIA in critical and severe individuals. Furthermore, the analysis of atypical MBCs suggested a developmental pathway similar to that of conventional MBCs through germinal centers, as indicated by the expression of several genes involved in germinal center processes, including CXCR4, CXCR5, BCL2, and MYC. Additionally, the upregulation of genes characteristic of the immune response in COVID-19, such as ZFP36 and DUSP1, suggested that the differentiation and activation of atypical MBCs may be influenced by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and that these genes may contribute to the immune response for COVID-19 recovery. Our study contributes to a better understanding of atypical MBCs in COVID-19 and the role of other B cell subsets across different clinical manifestations.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can increase the risk of neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegenerative diseases. Certain IAV strains, such as avian H7N7 subtype, possess neurotropic properties, enabling them to directly invade the brain parenchyma and infect neurons and glia cells. Host sex significantly influences the severity of IAV infections. Studies indicate that females of the reproductive age exhibit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses to IAVs compared to males. This heightened immune response correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, and potential neuronal damage in females. Understanding the sex-specific neurotropism of IAV and associated mechanisms leading to adverse neurological outcomes is essential. Our study reveals that primary hippocampal cultures from female mice show heightened interferon-β and pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion following neurotropic IAV infection. We observed sex-specific differences in microglia activation: both sexes showed a transition into a hyper-ramified state, but only male-derived microglia exhibited an increase in amoeboid-shaped cells. These disparities extended to alterations in neuronal morphology. Neurons derived from female mice displayed increased spine density within 24 h post-infection, while no significant change was observed in male cultures. This aligns with sex-specific differences in microglial synaptic pruning. Data suggest that amoeboid-shaped microglia preferentially target postsynaptic terminals, potentially reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Conversely, hyper-ramified microglia may focus on presynaptic terminals, potentially limiting viral spread. In conclusion, our findings underscore the utility of primary hippocampal cultures, incorporating microglia, as an effective model to study sex-specific, virus-induced effects on brain-resident cells.">

The production of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are physiologically involved in cell communication, is also altered during COVID-19, along with the dysfunction of cytoplasmic organelles. Since circulating EVs reflect the state of their cells of origin, they represent valuable tools for monitoring pathological conditions. Despite challenges in detecting EVs due to their size and specific cellular compartment origin using different methodologies, flow cytometry has proven to be an effective method for assessing the role of EVs in COVID-19. This review summarizes the involvement of plasmatic EVs in COVID-19 patients and individuals with Long COVID (LC) affected by post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), highlighting their dual role in exerting both pro- and antiviral effects. We also emphasize how flow cytometry, with its multiparametric approach, can be employed to characterize circulating EVs, particularly in infectious diseases such as COVID-19, and suggest their potential role in chronic impairments during post-infection.">

COVID-19 has taught us that the development of vaccines, repurposing of drugs, and understanding the mechanism of a disease can be done within a short time. The COVID-19 proteomics and metabolomics has contributed to its diagnosis, understanding of its progression, host-virus interaction, disease mechanism, and also in the search of suitable anti-COVID therapeutics. Mass spectrometry based proteomics was used to find the potential biomarkers of different stages of COVID-19 including severe and nonsevere cases in the blood serum. Notably, protein-protein interaction techniques to understand host-virus interactions were also significantly useful. The single-cell proteomics studies were carried out to ascertain the changes in immune cell composition and its activation in mild COVID-19 patients versus severe COVID-19 patients using whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Modern technologies were helpful to deal with the pandemic; however, there is still scope for further development. Further, attempts were made to understand the protein-protein, metabolite-metabolite, and protein-metabolite interactomes, derived from proteins and metabolite fingerprints of COVID-19 patients by reanalysis of COVID-19 public mass spectrometry based proteomics and metabolomics studies. Further, some of these interactions were supported by the literature as validations in the COVID-19 studies.">

Here, using human upper/lower airway and intestinal cells, we examined the previously dominant BA.1-BA.5 and BA.2.75 subvariants, together with the recently emerged XBB/BQ lineages, in comparison to the former Delta variant. We observed a tendency for each virus to demonstrate higher growth capability than the previously dominant subvariants. Unlike human bronchial and intestinal cells, nasal epithelial cells accommodated the efficient entry of certain Omicron subvariants, similar to the Delta variant. In contrast to the Delta's reliance on cell-surface transmembrane protease serine 2, all tested Omicron variants depended on endosomal cathepsin L. Moreover, S1/S2 cleavage of early Omicron spikes was less efficient, whereas recent viruses exhibit improved cleavage efficacy. Our results show that the Omicron variant progressively adapts to human cells through continuous endosome-mediated host cell entry.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, has evolved into a number of variants/subvariants, which have generated multiple global waves of infection. In order to monitor/predict virological features of emerging variants and determine appropriate strategies for anti-viral development, understanding conserved or altered features of evolving SARS-CoV-2 is important. In this study, we addressed previously or recently predominant Omicron subvariants and demonstrated the gradual adaptation to human cells. The host cell entry route, which was altered from the former Delta variant, was conserved among all tested Omicron subvariants. Collectively, this study revealed both changing and maintained features of SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron variant evolution.">

This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a threat to public health. Current therapeutics remain limited to direct acting antivirals that lack distinct mechanisms of action and are already showing signs of viral resistance. The virus encodes an ADP-ribosylhydrolase macrodomain (Mac1) that plays an important role in the coronaviral lifecycle by suppressing host innate immune responses. Genetic inactivation of Mac1 abrogates viral replication in vivo by potentiating host innate immune responses. However, it is unknown whether this can be achieved by pharmacologic inhibition and can therefore be exploited therapeutically. Here we report a potent and selective lead small molecule, AVI-4206, that is effective in an in vivo model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cellular models indicate that AVI-4206 has high target engagement and can weakly inhibit viral replication in a gamma interferon- and Mac1 catalytic activity-dependent manner; a stronger antiviral effect for AVI-4206 is observed in human airway organoids. In an animal model of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, AVI-4206 reduces viral replication, potentiates innate immune responses, and leads to a survival benefit. Our results provide pharmacological proof of concept that Mac1 is a valid therapeutic target via a novel immune-restoring mechanism that could potentially synergize with existing therapies targeting distinct, essential aspects of the coronaviral life cycle. This approach could be more widely used to target other viral macrodomains to develop antiviral therapeutics beyond COVID-19.">

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: In this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n=204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Results: Plasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.">

Here, we showed mice lacking activating FcγRs (FcRγ-/-) developed prolonged clinical disease with more virus in joint-associated tissues. Viral clearance was associated with anti-MAYV cell surface binding rather than neutralizing antibodies. Lack of Fc-FcγR engagement increased the number of monocytes through chronic timepoints. Single cell RNA sequencing showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes in joint-associated tissue with increased MAYV RNA present in FcRγ-/- monocytes and macrophages. Transfer of FcRγ-/- monocytes into wild type animals was sufficient to increase virus in joint-associated tissue. Overall, this study suggests that engagement of antibody Fc with activating FcγRs promotes protective responses during MAYV infection and prevents monocytes from being potential targets of infection.">

        <tr id="Coxsackievirus B (CVB) infection has long been considered an environmental factor precipitating Type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disease marked by loss of insulin-producing β cells within pancreatic islets. Previous studies have shown CVB infection negatively impacts islet function and viability but do not report on how virus infection individually affects the multiple cell types present in human primary islets. Therefore, we hypothesized that the various islet cell populations have unique transcriptional responses to CVB infection. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on human cadaveric islets treated with either CVB or poly(I:C), a viral mimic, for 24 and 48 hours. Our global analysis reveals CVB differentially induces dynamic transcriptional changes associated with multiple cell processes and functions over time whereas poly(I:C) promotes an immune response that progressively increases with treatment duration. At the single-cell resolution, we find CVB infects all islet cell types at similar rates yet induces unique cell-type specific transcriptional responses with β, α, and ductal cells having the strongest response. Sequencing and functional data suggest that CVB negatively impacts mitochondrial respiration and morphology in distinct ways in β and α cells, while also promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species. We also observe an increase in the expression of the long-noncoding RNA MIR7-3HG in β cells with high viral titers and reveal its knockdown reduces gene expression of viral proteins as well as apoptosis in stem cell-derived islets. Together, these findings demonstrate a cell-specific transcriptional, temporal, and functional response to CVB infection and provide new insights into the relationship between CVB infection and T1D.">

        <tr id="Background Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in virus control. However, it has remained largely unclear whether NK cell mobilization in SARS-CoV-2 infections is beneficial or pathologic. To address this deficit, we employed a validated experimental NK cell depletion non-human primate (NHP) model with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant B.1.617.2 challenge. Viral loads (VL), NK cell numbers, activation, proliferation, and functional measures were evaluated in blood and tissues. In non-depleted (control) animals, infection rapidly induced NK cell expansion, activation, and increased tissue trafficking associated with VL. Strikingly, we report that experimental NK cell depletion leads to higher VL, longer duration of viral shedding, significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and overt lung damage. Overall, we find the first significant and conclusive evidence for NK cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and disease pathology. These data indicate that adjunct therapies for infection could largely benefit from NK cell-targeted approaches.">

COVID-19 was formally named by WHO, and the Global Committee on Taxonomy referred to it as extreme Acute respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently there is no efficient method to control the extent of SARS-CoV-2 other than social distancing and hygiene activities. This study aims to present a simple medicinal strategy for combating fatal viral diseases like COVID-19 with minimum effort and intervention. Different Ayurveda medicines (Curcuma longa, green tea, andPiper nigrum) inhibit virus entrance and pathogen transmission while also enhancing immunity. Piperine (1-piperoylpiperidine), as well as curcumin, combine to create an intermolecular complex (ππ) that improves curcumin bioavailability by inhibiting glucuronidation of curcumin in the liver. The receptor-binding domains of the S-protein and also the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor of the recipient organism are directly occupied by curcumin and catechin, respectively, thereby preventing viruses from entering the cell. As a result, the infection will be tolerated by the animal host.">

        <tr id="Abstract Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism underlies neurodegenerative disease and is increasingly implicated in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) is a key enzyme in alternative cholesterol metabolism. A recessive mutation in the gene CYP7B1 is known to cause a neurodegenerative disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 and oxysterol accumulation. However, the role of CYP7B1 in neuroinflammation has been little revealed. In this study, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), as a murine model of MS, using CYP7B1 homozygous knockout (KO) mice. We found that CYP7B1 deficiency can significantly attenuate EAE severity. CYP7B1 deficiency is sufficient to reduce leukocyte infiltration into the central nervous system, suppress proliferation of pathogenic CD4+ T cells, and decrease myeloid cell activation during EAE. Additionally, live-animal imaging targeting translocator protein expression, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein biomarker of neuroinflammation, showed that CYP7B1 deficiency results in suppressed neuroinflammation. Using human monocyte-derived microglia-like cellular disease model and primary microglia of CYP7B1 KO mice, we also found that activation of microglia of CYP7B1 deficiency was impaired. These cumulative results suggest that CYP7B1 can regulate neuroinflammation, thus providing potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Public health systems reported low mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in East Asia, in low-income countries, and for children during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These reports led commentators to suggest that cross-reactive immunity from prior exposure to other pathogens reduced fatality risk. Resolution of initial infection waves also contributed to speculation that herd immunity prevented further waves prior to vaccination. Serology instead implied that immunity was too limited to achieve herd immunity and that there was little impact from cross-reactive protection. Paediatric deaths exceeded those from influenza, with higher age-specific fatality risk in lower-income nations and similar fatality risk in East Asia compared with demographically similar regions. Neither pre-outbreak exposure to related pathogens nor immunity induced by initial infection waves are necessarily a reliable response to future pathogen outbreaks. Preparedness for future pathogen outbreaks should instead focus on strategies such as voluntary behavioural changes, nonpharmaceutical interventions, and vaccination.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Optic neuritis (ON), one of the clinical manifestations of the human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS), was also reported in patients with COVID-19 infection, highlighting one potential neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2. However, the mechanism of ON in these patients is poorly understood.


EVIDENCE ACQUISITION
Insight may be gained by studying the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), a β-coronavirus that belongs to the same family as SARS-CoV-2.


RESULTS
Mouse hepatitis virus-A59, or its isogenic spike protein recombinant strains, inoculation in mice provides an important experimental model to understand underpinning mechanisms of neuroinflammatory demyelination in association with acute stage optic nerve inflammation and chronic stage optic nerve demyelination concurrent with axonal loss. Spike is a surface protein that mediates viral binding and entry into host cells, as well as cell-cell fusion and viral spread. Studies have implicated spike-mediated mechanisms of virus-induced neuroinflammatory demyelination by comparing naturally occurring demyelinating (DM) and nondemyelinating (NDM) MHV strains.


CONCLUSIONS
Here, we summarize findings in MHV-induced experimental ON and myelitis, using natural DM and NDM strains as well as engineered recombinant strains of MHV to understand the role of spike protein in inducing ON and demyelinating disease pathology. Potential parallels in human coronavirus-mediated ON and demyelination, and insight into potential therapeutic strategies, are discussed.">

        <tr id="Massive infections of people with the previously unidentified SARS-CoV-2 virus have been a shock to the global healthcare system. While many studies have focused on the clinical manifestations of the disease and its treatment methods, understanding the molecular and genetic aspects of infection has proved critical to understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction. The scientists focused on issues of gene expression and their regulation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, we conducted a study of gene expression within the framework of the project «COVID-19: Scientific and technological justification of the response system to the spread of new respiratory infections, including coronavirus infection», the results of which are presented in the article [1].Hence, variations in the gene expression profiles of TLR 3 (Toll-Like receptor), TLR 7, TLR 4, ACE 2 (Angiotensing converting enzyme), TMPRSS 13 (Transmembrane serine protease), INF-Ɣ (Interferon gamma), and IL 4 (Interleukin) were discerned across all investigated cohorts, including those assessed six months post-recovery. There is a complex of pathways of immune system to defense with the infection including the involvement of toll-like receptor signaling pathways which contact of viral particles. Moreover, the surge in ACE2 expression demonstrates the multifunctional role as gates for Sars-Cov-2 to enter cells and activation of innate immunity responses. Although, the upregulation of INF-Ɣ and IL-4 as proinflammatory cytokines were contributed to the initiation and the progression of the cytokine storm.">

Here, we link heterogenous neutrophil populations to disease severity in COVID-19. We identified neutrophils with features of cellular aging and immunosuppressive capacity in mild COVID-19 and features of neutrophil immaturity and activation in severe disease. The low-density neutrophil (LDN) number in circulating blood correlated with COVID-19 severity. Many of the divergent neutrophil phenotypes in COVID-19 were overrepresented in the LDN fraction and were less detectable in normal-density neutrophils. Functionally, neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 displayed defects in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species production. Soluble factors secreted by neutrophils from these patients inhibited T cell proliferation. Neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 had increased expression of arginase-1 protein, a feature that was retained in convalescent patients. Despite this increase in intracellular expression, there was a reduction in arginase-1 release by neutrophils into serum and culture supernatants. Furthermore, neutrophil-mediated T cell suppression was independent of arginase-1. Our results indicate the presence of dysfunctional, activated, and immature neutrophils in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Introduction The immunological characteristics that could protect children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from severe or fatal illnesses have not been fully understood yet. Methods Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on peripheral blood samples of 15 children (8 with COVID-19) and compared them to 18 adults (13 with COVID-19). Results The child-adult integrated single cell data indicated that children with the disease presented a restrained response to type I interferon in most of the major immune cell types, along with suppression of upstream interferon regulatory factor and toll-like receptor expression in monocytes, which was confirmed by in vitro interferon stimulation assays. Unlike adult patients, children with COVID-19 showed lower frequencies of activated proinflammatory CD14+ monocytes, possibly explaining the rareness of cytokine storm in them. Notably, natural killer (NK) cells in pediatric patients displayed potent cytotoxicity with a rich expression of cytotoxic molecules and upregulated cytotoxic pathways, whereas the cellular senescence, along with the Notch signaling pathway, was significantly downregulated in NK cells, all suggesting more robust cytotoxicity in NK cells of children than adult patients that was further confirmed by CD107a degranulation assays. Lastly, a modest adaptive immune response was evident with more naïve T cells but less activated and proliferated T cells while less naïve B cells but more activated B cells in children over adult patients. Conclusion Conclusively, this preliminary study revealed distinct cell frequency and activation status of major immune cell types, particularly more robust NK cell cytotoxicity in PBMC that might help protect children from severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a neurotropic member of the genus Orthoflavivirus (former Flavivirus) and is of significant health concern in Europe and Asia. TBEV pathogenesis may occur directly via virus-induced damage to neurons or through immunopathology due to excessive inflammation. While primary cells isolated from the host can be used to study the immune response to TBEV, it is still unclear how well these reflect the immune response elicited in vivo. Here, we compared the transcriptional response to TBEV and the less pathogenic tick-borne flavivirus, Langat virus (LGTV), in primary monocultures of neurons, astrocytes and microglia in vitro, with the transcriptional response in vivo captured by single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of a whole mouse cortex. We detected similar transcriptional changes induced by both LGTV and TBEV infection in vitro, with the lower response to LGTV likely resulting from slower viral kinetics. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a stronger transcriptional response in vivo than in vitro for astrocytes and microglia, with a limited overlap mainly dominated by interferon signaling. Together, this adds to our understanding of neurotropic flavivirus pathogenesis and the strengths and limitations of available model systems.">

        <tr id="Mucosal immunity plays a crucial role in defending against coronaviruses, particularly at respiratory sites, serving as the first line of defense against viral invasion and replication. Coronaviruses have developed various immune evasion strategies at the mucosal immune system, hindering the recognition of infected cells and evading antibody responses. Understanding the immune mechanisms and responses is crucial for developing effective vaccines and therapeutics against coronaviruses. The role of mucosal immunity in COVID-19 is significant, influencing both local and systemic immune responses to the virus. Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Mucosally delivered vaccines and those under clinical trials are being compared and contrasted to understand their effectiveness in inducing mucosal immunity against coronaviruses. A greater understanding of lung tissue-based immunity may lead to improved diagnostic and prognostic procedures and novel treatment strategies aimed at reducing the disease burden of community-acquired pneumonia, avoiding the systemic manifestations of infection and excess morbidity and mortality. This comprehensive review article outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. It also proposes that there is a significant role for mucosal immunity and for secretory as well as circulating IgA antibodies in COVID-19, and that it is important to elucidate this in order to comprehend especially the asymptomatic and mild states of the infection, which appear to account for the majority of cases. Moreover, it is possible that mucosal immunity can be exploited for beneficial diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes. The findings from recent studies on mucosal immunity in COVID-19 can be used to develop effective vaccines and treatments that can effectively target both mucosal and systemic immune responses.">

        <tr id="A series of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory disease was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Many patients have had direct or indirect links with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Wuhan. This is the prologue to the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has affected more than 150 countries and over 250,000 people worldwide, killing thousands of people. The pandemic has once again drawn public attention to the coronaviruses that developed epidemics in China (2002) and Saudi Arabia (2012). Given the structural and phylogenetic similarity of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the results of recent studies have been combined with new findings to complete one of the strangest pneumonia puzzles in the human history. Coronaviruses establish extremely complex interactions with the immune system, especially in order to evade immune responses. Undoubtedly, increasing our knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of diseases caused by these viruses will eventually lead to more effective treatment and diagnosis. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are among the leading immune response regulators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the expression and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses and in many immune disorders from autoimmunity to cancer and allergies. Our understanding of the functions of human and viral miRNAs in the pathogenesis of many viruses has increased in recent years. Accordingly, the present review article aims to review studies evaluating the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of other Betacoronaviruses. The results of these studies, given the similarity of viruses within the family Coronaviridae, could be helpful for future research on SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="A severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifests as systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement is called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). This review examines the possible relationship between gut barrier integrity, the microbiome, dysregulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling, and MIS-C. Clinical and biochemical features of MIS-C are comparable to those of other hyper-inflammatory syndromes, suggesting a dysregulated immune response. One possible explanation for the systemic inflammation seen in MIS-C patients is the SARS-CoV-2-induced dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathway. In addition, new data suggest a reciprocal link between gut barrier integrity and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits bacteriophage-like behavior, highlighting the role of bacteria as a reservoir for the virus and emphasizing the importance of understanding the bacteriophagic mechanism of the virus in fecal–oral transmission. The increased translocation of viral products and bacterial toxins may result from disrupting the intestinal barrier and cause systemic inflammation. On the other hand, systemic inflammation can weaken the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which feeds back into the loop of immunological dysregulation. In the context of MIS-C, understanding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection, IL-6, and gut barrier integrity may shed light on the etiology of the disease and guide treatment options. Since children with gut dysbiosis may be more susceptible to MIS-C, it is critical to reinforce their microbiome through probiotics supplementation, and plant-fiber-rich diets (prebiotics). Early antibiotic treatment and the use of zonulin antagonists should also be considered.">

        <tr id="A natural infection or a vaccination can initially prime the immune system to form immunological memory. The immunity engendered by vaccination against COVID-19 versus natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 has not been well studied in the Indian population. In this study, we compared the immunity conferred by COVID-19 vaccines to naturally acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in a South Indian population. We examined binding and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels against the ancestral and variant lineages and assessed the ex vivo cellular parameters of memory T cells, memory B cells, and monocytes and finally measured the circulating cytokine response. COVID-19 vaccination stimulates heightened levels of IgG antibodies against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, as well as increased binding to the spike protein and neutralizing antibody levels. This enhanced response extends to variant lineages such as B.1.617.2 (Delta, India), B.1.1.529 (Omicron, India), B.1.351 (Beta, South Africa), and B.1.1.7 (Alpha, UK). COVID-19 vaccination differs from SARS-CoV-2 infection by having increased frequencies of classical memory B cells, activated memory B and plasma cells, CD4/CD8 T cells of effector memory, effector cells, stem cell-like memory T cells, and classical and intermediate monocytes and diminished frequencies of CD4/CD8 T cells of central memory and non-classical monocytes in vaccinated individuals in comparison to those with natural infection. Thus, COVID-19 vaccination is characterized by enhanced humoral responses and robust activation of innate and memory T cell responses in comparison to natural infection in a South Indian population.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

        <tr id="The lung is constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and particles that can cause alveolar damage. Hence, appropriate repair responses are essential for gas exchange and life. Here, we deciphered the spatiotemporal trajectory and function of an atypical population of macrophages after lung injury. Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Background: The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial to viral entry and can cause cardiac injuries. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NOD-, LPR-, and pyrin-domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome are critical immune system components implicated in cardiac fibrosis. The spike protein activates NLRP3 inflammasome through TLR4 or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, damaging various organs. However, the role of spike protein in cardiac fibrosis in humans, as well as its interactions with NLRP3 inflammasomes and TLR4, remain poorly understood. Methods: We utilized scratch assays, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence to evaluate the migration, fibrosis signaling, mitochondrial calcium levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cell morphology of cultured human cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) treated with spike (S1) protein for 24 h with or without an anti-ACE2 neutralizing antibody, a TLR4 blocker, or an NLRP3 inhibitor. Results: S1 protein enhanced CFs migration and the expressions of collagen 1, α-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), phosphorylated SMAD2/3, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). S1 protein increased ROS production but did not affect mitochondrial calcium content and cell morphology. Treatment with an anti-ACE2 neutralizing antibody attenuated the effects of S1 protein on collagen 1 and TGF-β1 expressions. Moreover, NLRP3 (MCC950) and NF-kB inhibitors, but not the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242, prevented the S1 protein-enhanced CFs migration and overexpression of collagen 1, TGF-β1, and IL-1β. Conclusion: S1 protein activates human CFs by priming NLRP3 inflammasomes through NF-κB signaling in an ACE2-dependent manner.">

        <tr id="In central nervous system (CNS) diseases characterized by late-onset neurodegeneration, the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in extensive health challenges globally. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, clinical studies have revealed that it could also affect multiple organs, including the heart, kidneys, liver, and brain, leading to severe complications. To unravel the intricate molecular interactions between the virus and host tissues, we performed an integrated transcriptomic analysis to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on various organs, with a particular focus on the relationship between renal failure and COVID-19. A comparative analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 triggers a systemic immune response in the brain, heart, and kidney tissues, characterized by significant upregulation of cytokine and chemokine secretion, along with enhanced migration of lymphocytes and leukocytes. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 could also induce tissue-specific transcriptional profiling. More importantly, single-cell sequencing revealed that COVID-19 patients with renal failure exhibited lower metabolic activity in lung epithelial and B cells, with reduced ligand–receptor interactions, especially CD226 and ICAM, suggesting a compromised immune response. A trajectory analysis revealed that COVID-19 patients with renal failure exhibited less mature alveolar type 1 cells. Furthermore, these patients showed potential fibrosis in the hearts, liver, and lung increased extracellular matrix remodeling activities. However, there was no significant metabolic dysregulation in the liver of COVID-19 patients with renal failure. Candidate drugs prediction by Drug Signatures database and LINCS L1000 Antibody Perturbations Database underscored the importance of considering multi-organ effects in COVID-19 management and highlight potential therapeutic strategies, including targeting viral entry and replication, controlling tissue fibrosis, and alleviating inflammation.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, swept across the globe, triggering unprecedented disruptions to health, economies, and societies. Emerging in late 2019, the virus rapidly spread worldwide, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a global pandemic in March 2020. This infectious respiratory illness presented a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild respiratory issues to severe pneumonia, and unfortunately, in some cases, resulted in death. The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets, necessitating measures like mask-wearing, social distancing, and frequent hand washing to mitigate transmission. Governments and health authorities worldwide implemented various containment measures, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and vaccination campaigns, to curb the spread of the virus and alleviate its impact on healthcare systems. These measures, while vital, also had profound social, economic, and psychological consequences, exacerbating existing inequalities and vulnerabilities in societies. Efforts to combat the virus included the development and deployment of vaccines, offering hope for controlling the spread and reducing the severity of infections. However, new variants and ongoing challenges in vaccine distribution and hesitancy continued to impact efforts to achieve widespread immunity. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reshaped the world, highlighting the interconnectedness of global health and emphasizing the importance of solidarity, scientific collaboration, and resilience in addressing such widespread challenges.">

        <tr id="Introduction SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still poses a significant burden on global health and economy, especially for symptoms persisting beyond the acute disease. COVID-19 manifests with various degrees of severity and the identification of early biomarkers capable of stratifying patient based on risk of progression could allow tailored treatments. Methods We longitudinally analyzed 67 patients, classified according to a WHO ordinal scale as having Mild, Moderate, or Severe COVID-19. Peripheral blood samples were prospectively collected at hospital admission and during a 6-month follow-up after discharge. Several subsets and markers of the innate and adaptive immunity were monitored as putative factors associated with COVID-19 symptoms. Results More than 50 immunological parameters were associated with disease severity. A decision tree including the main clinical, laboratory, and biological variables at admission identified low NK-cell precursors and CD14+CD91+ monocytes, and high CD8+ Effector Memory T cell frequencies as the most robust immunological correlates of COVID-19 severity and reduced survival. Moreover, low regulatory B-cell frequency at one month was associated with the susceptibility to develop long COVID at six months, likely due to their immunomodulatory ability. Discussion These results highlight the profound perturbation of the immune response during COVID-19. The evaluation of specific innate and adaptive immune-cell subsets allows to distinguish between different acute and persistent COVID-19 symptoms.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

        <tr id="Rhinovirus C (RV-C) infects airway epithelial cells and is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in humans. To interrogate the mechanisms of RV-C-mediated disease, animal models are essential. Towards this, RV-C infection was recently reported in wild-type (WT) mice, yet, titers were not sustained. Therefore, the requirements for RV-C infection in mice remain unclear. Notably, prior work has implicated human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as essential host factors for virus uptake and replication, respectively. Here, we report that even though human (h) and murine (m) CDHR3 orthologs have similar tissue distribution, amino acid sequence homology is limited. Further, while RV-C can replicate in mouse lung epithelial type 1 (LET1) cells and produce infectious virus, we observed a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of dsRNA-positive cells following hSTING expression. Based on these findings, we sought to assess the impact of hCDHR3 and hSTING on RV-C infection in mice in vivo. Thus, we developed hCDHR3 transgenic mice, and utilized adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver hSTING to the murine airways. Subsequent challenge of these mice with RV-C15 revealed significantly higher titers 24 h post-infection in mice expressing both hCDHR3 and hSTING—compared to either WT mice, or mice with hCDHR3 or hSTING alone, indicating more efficient infection. Ultimately, this mouse model can be further engineered to establish a robust in vivo model, recapitulating viral dynamics and disease.">

        <tr id="Neutralizing antibody responses correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet higher neutralizing responses associate with more severe disease. Whether people without severe disease can also develop strong neutralizing responses to infection, and the pathways involved, is less clear. We performed a proteomic analysis on sera from 71 individuals infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, enrolled during the first South African infection wave. We determined disease severity by whether participants required supplemental oxygen and measured neutralizing antibody levels at convalescence. High neutralizing antibodies were associated with high disease severity, yet 40% of participants with lower disease severity had neutralizing antibody levels comparable to those with severe disease. We found 130 differentially expressed proteins between high and low neutralizers and 40 between people with high versus low disease severity. Five proteins overlapped, including furin, a protease which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. High neutralizers with non-severe disease had similar levels of differentially expressed neutralization response proteins to high neutralizers with severe disease, yet similar levels of differentially expressed disease severity proteins to participants with non-severe disease. Furthermore, we could reasonably predict who developed a strong neutralizing response based on a single protein, HSPA8, involved in clathrin pit uncoating. These results indicate that a strong antibody response does not always require severe disease and may involve different pathways.">

Our previous research identified CTSL as a pivotal protease promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate elevated blood CTSL levels in individuals with diabetes, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia correlates positively with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients, while acute hyperglycemia augments CTSL activity in healthy individuals. In vitro studies reveal high glucose, but not insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells, with CTSL knockout cells displaying reduced susceptibility. Utilizing lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, alongside Leprdb/dbmice and Leprdb/+mice, we illustrate increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation in diabetic comorbidities and complications.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Increasing evidence suggests that Fc‐mediated antibody effector functions have an important role in protection against respiratory viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. However, limited data are available on the potential differences in the development, heterogeneity and durability of these responses in children compared to adults. Methods Here, we assessed the development of spike S1‐specific serum antibody‐dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement deposition (ADCD) and natural killer cell activation (ADNKA), alongside specific antibody binding concentrations (IgG, IgA and IgM) and IgG avidity in healthy adults (n = 38, 18–56 years) and children (n = 21, 5–16 years) following primary SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, with a 10‐month longitudinal follow‐up. Differences between groups were assessed using a nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons test. Results We found similar (functional) antibody responses in children compared to adults, with a tendency for increased durability in children, which was statistically significant for ADCD (P < 0.05). While ADNKA was strongly reduced in both adults (P < 0.001) and children (P < 0.05) at the latest time point, ADCP remained relatively stable over time, possibly relating to an increase in avidity of the spike‐specific antibodies (P < 0.001). Finally, the ADNKA capacity relative to antibody concentration appeared to decrease over time in both children and adults. Conclusion In conclusion, our data provide novel insights into the development of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibody Fc‐mediated effector functions in children and adults. An increased understanding of these characteristics in specific age populations is valuable for the future design of novel and improved vaccination strategies for respiratory viruses such as SARS‐CoV‐2.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Throughout history, the influenza A virus has caused numerous devastating global pandemics. Macrophages, as pivotal innate immune cells, exhibit a wide range of immune functions characterized by distinct polarization states, reflecting their intricate heterogeneity. In this study, we employed the time-resolved single-cell sequencing technique coupled with metabolic RNA labelling to elucidate the dynamic transcriptional changes in distinct polarized states of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon infection with the influenza A virus. Our approach not only captures the temporal dimension of transcriptional activity, which is lacking in conventional scRNA-seq methods, but also reveals that M2-polarized Arg1_macrophage cluster is the sole state supporting successful replication of influenza A virus. Furthermore, we identified distinct antigen presentation capabilities to CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells across diverse polarized states of macrophages. Notably, the M1 phenotype, exhibited by (BMDMs) and murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), demonstrated superior conventional and cross-presentation abilities for exogenous antigens, with a particular emphasis on cross-presentation capacity. Additionally, as CD8+ T cell differentiation progressed, M1 polarization exhibited an enhanced capacity for cross-presentation. All three phenotypes of BMDMs, including M1, demonstrated robust presentation to CD4+ regulatory T cells, while displaying limited ability to present to naive CD4+ T cells. These findings offer novel insights into the immunological regulatory mechanisms governing distinct polarized states of macrophages, particularly their roles in restricting the replication of influenza A virus and modulating antigen-specific T cell responses through innate immunity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis and HIV-1 co-infection worsens the already poor prognosis. How Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the influence of HIV-1 on pathogenesis remains unclear. Using human pericytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia alone; and combined in an in vitro BBB we investigated Mtb +/− HIV-1 co-infection on central nervous system cell entry and function. Mtb infected and multiplied in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. The permeability of the BBB increased resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects included increased markers of cellular stress, ROS release, the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes, and increased secretion of neuroexcitotoxic glutamate. Distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators were observed. These data indicate Mtb can translocate the BBB directly to initiate meningitis.">

The activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, involving microglia, macrophages, and T and B cells, while required for efficient viral control within the CNS, is also associated with neuropathology. Under pathological events, such as CNS viral infection, microglia/macrophage undergo a reactive response, leading to the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery into the brain, disrupting CNS homeostasis and contributing to the pathogenesis of disease. The Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelination disease (TMEV-IDD), which serves as a mouse model of MS. This murine model made significant contributions to our understanding of the pathophysiology of MS following subsequent to infection. Microglia/macrophages could be activated into two different states, classic activated state (M1 state) and alternative activated state (M2 state) during TMEV infection. M1 possesses the capacity to initiate inflammatory response and secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M2-liked microglia/macrophages are anti-inflammatory characterized by the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This review aims to discuss the roles of microglia/macrophages M1/M2-liked polarization during TMEV infection, and explore the potential therapeutic effect of balancing M1/M2-liked polarization of microglia/macrophages on MS.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background: Studies have reported that 5hmC features in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could serve as early warning biomarkers for the occurrence and progression of COVID-19, as well as myocardial injury. However, its roles in the occurrence and progression of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) following COVID-19 infection has not been fully studied. Methods: Firstly, we used the 5hmC-Seal technique to obtain genome-wide 5hmC profiles from plasma cfDNA of 24 ACS2N patients (individuals experiencing ACS onset within 2 months after COVID-19 infection), 28 ACS2W patients (individuals experiencing ACS onset beyond 2 months after COVID-19 infection), and 16 ACS patients (patients with ACS without COVID-19 infection). Secondly, we performed GO, KEGG analysis on the differentially expressed genes and identified a series of immune and inflammation related genes. Thirdly, the distribution of immune cells in different groups of patients was studied by immune infiltration analysis. Finally, we performed PPI network analysis on these genes to identify potential key target genes. Results: In this study, we firstly found that there was a significant difference in 5hmC levels between ACS2N patients and ACS patients, while the difference between ACS2W and ACS was not significant. Secondly, it was found that neutrophils were abnormally activated in the ACS2N group. Finally, a target gene phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) was found to be highly expressed in the ACS2N group by PPI network analysis of the differential genes and validated with external datasets. Conclusions: Our study suggested that 5hmC markers extracted from plasma cfDNA could differentiate between ACS2N and ACS patients. In addition, we observed that neutrophils exhibited abnormal activation in ACS2N patients. Further analysis showed that COVID-19 infection may affect the occurrence and development of ACS by abnormally up-regulating PDE4D gene expression.">

One correlate of response is the reinvigoration of a subset of CD8 T cells that have an exhausted phenotype and impaired functionality. In order to develop new therapies, reproducible models are required to identify candidate target genes that enables the reversal of key hallmarks of T cell exhaustion. Here we describe the development of an in vitro model by chronically stimulating T cells with their cognate antigen and performed an in depth temporal phenotypic characterisation. This model recapitulates many of the critical hallmarks of exhaustion, including increased expression of canonical exhaustion surface markers, impaired proliferation, reduced cytokine production, decreased release of cytotoxic granules, and metabolic alterations, including dysfunctional mitochondria. These exhaustion hallmarks were validated using an in vivo model and a gene signature identified which robustly define the shared in vitro and in vivo exhausted state. Critically, this signature is also observed in tumour infiltrating T cells from multiple human tumour types, validating the translational potential of this model for discovering and triaging new therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains an international health problem caused by the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of May 2024, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths globally. Despite current vaccination programs, infections are still rapidly increasing, mainly due to the appearance and spread of new variants, variations in immunization rates, and limitations of current vaccines in preventing transmission. This underscores the need for pan-variant antivirals and treatments. The interferon (IFN) system is a critical element of the innate immune response and serves as a frontline defense against viruses. It induces a generalized antiviral state by transiently upregulating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To gain a deeper comprehension of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, its connection to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and the potential therapeutic implications, this review provides a detailed overview of fundamental aspects of the diverse ISGs identified for their antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. It emphasizes the importance of these proteins in controlling viral replication and spread. Furthermore, we explore methodological approaches for the identification of ISGs and conduct a comparative analysis with other viruses. Deciphering the roles of ISGs and their interactions with viral pathogens can help identify novel targets for antiviral therapies and enhance our preparedness to confront current and future viral threats.">

        <tr id="        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2). It is characterized by respiratory distress, multiorgan dysfunction and death in some cases. The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestation. However the pathological mechanism underling the disease has not been fully defined. Lung autopsy samples from 3 patients with fatal COVID-19 were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin stain to analyze the histopathological changes. While immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed for detecting CD4 in helper T-cells, CD8 in cytotoxic T-cells, CD56 in NK-cells and CD45RO in memory T-cells. Histopathological examination revealed features of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with exudate in alveolar space and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Immunohistochemistry staining for CD4 showed weak to positive staining, CD8 showed weak positive staining, CD56 showed negative staining, while CD45RO showed a positive staining. It can be concluded that SARS-CoV-2 virus impaired innate immune response through a decrease in NK cells and adaptive immune response through a decrease in CD8 T cells which is one of the explanations of the destructive nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus.">

        <tr id="The enduring impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its disease manifestation, COVID-19, on public health remains significant. Postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) affect a considerable number of patients, impairing their quality of life. While the role of the cytokine storm in acute COVID-19 is well established, its contribution to the pathophysiology of PASC is not fully understood. This study aimed to analyze the cytokine profile of patients with PASC following in vitro stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, comparing them with a healthy control group. From October 2020 till March 2021, Brugmann University Hospital's clinical research unit included patients with PASC in the study. Whole blood samples were collected from 50 patients and 25 healthy volunteers. After in vitro stimulation under five different conditions, cytokine levels were measured using a multiplex method. Significantly decreased cytokine levels were observed in patients with PASC compared with healthy volunteers, particularly after TLR4 (interleukin [IL]-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-10, interferon (IFN)α, IFNγ, IFNω, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α) and TLR7/8 (IL-1α, IL-1β, IFNα, IFNω, IFNγ, and TNFα) pathway stimulation. Principal component analysis identified two distinct clusters, suggesting a likely dysregulation of immunity involving TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways in patients with PASC. Our study suggests that TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways play a role in the pathophysiology of PASC. Continuous basal activation of immunity could explain the high basal concentrations of cytokines described in these patients and the decreased amplitude of response of these signaling pathways following specific stimulation.">

        <tr id="The average cost to bring a new drug from its initial discovery to a patient's bedside is estimated to surpass $2 billion and requires over a decade of research and development. There is a need for new drug screening technologies that can parse drug candidates with increased likelihood of clinical utility early in development in order to increase the cost-effectiveness of this pipeline. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, resources were rapidly mobilized to identify effective therapeutic treatments but many lead antiviral compounds failed to demonstrate efficacy when progressed to human trials. To address the lack of predictive preclinical drug screening tools, PREDICT96-ALI, a high-throughput (n = 96) microphysiological system (MPS)  that recapitulates primary human tracheobronchial tissue,is adapted for the evaluation of differential antiviral efficacy of native SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Here, PREDICT96-ALI resolves both the differential viral kinetics between variants and the efficacy of antiviral compounds over a range of drug doses. PREDICT96-ALI is able to distinguish clinically efficacious antiviral therapies like remdesivir and nirmatrelvir from promising lead compounds that do not show clinical efficacy. Importantly, results from this proof-of-concept study track with known clinical outcomes, demonstrate the feasibility of this technology as a prognostic drug discovery tool.">

        <tr id="Introduction Influenza virus infections are a major global health problem. Influenza can result in mild/moderate disease or progress to more severe disease, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Severity is thought to be primarily driven by immunopathology, but predicting which individuals are at a higher risk of being hospitalized warrants investigation into host genetics and the molecular signatures of the host response during influenza infections. Methods Here, we performed transcriptome and genotype analysis in healthy controls and patients exhibiting mild/moderate or severe influenza (ICU patients). A unique aspect of our study was the genotyping of all participants, which allowed us to assign ethnicities based on genetic variation and assess whether the variation was correlated with expression levels. Results We identified 169 differentially expressed genes and related molecular pathways between patients in the ICU and those who were not in the ICU. The transcriptome/genotype association analysis identified 871 genes associated to a genetic variant and 39 genes distinct between African-Americans and Caucasians. We also investigated the effects of age and sex and found only a few discernible gene effects in our cohort. Discussion Together, our results highlight select risk factors that may contribute to an increased risk of ICU admission for influenza-infected patients. This should help to develop better diagnostic tools based on molecular signatures, in addition to a better understanding of the biological processes in the host response to influenza.">

While the exact mechanisms underlying PASC remain to be defined, hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of long COVID are varied and include (but are not limited to) dysregulated local or systemic inflammatory responses, autoimmune mechanisms, viral-induced hormonal imbalances, skeletal muscle abnormalities, complement dysregulation, novel abzymes, and long-term persistence of virus and/or fragments of viral RNA or proteins. This review article is based on a comprehensive review of the wide range of symptoms most often observed in long COVID and an attempt to integrate that information into a plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of PASC. In particular, it is proposed that long-term dysregulation of the gut in response to viral persistence could lead to the myriad of symptoms observed in PASC.">

        <tr id="Globally, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are the most common causes of death due to the lack of early predictive and diagnostic tools. Therefore, research for a new biomarker is crucial. Inflammatory biomarkers are critical central players in the pathogenesis of viral infections. IL-18, produced by macrophages in early viral infections, triggers inflammatory biomarkers and interferon production, crucial for viral host defense. Finding out IL-18 function can help understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and predict disease prognosis. Histamine and its receptors regulate allergic lung responses, with H1 receptor inhibition potentially reducing inflammation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors on cholangiocytes suggest liver involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current study presents the potential impact of circulating acetylcholine, histamine, IL-18, and interferon-Alpha as diagnostic tools in HCV, COVID-19, and dual HCV-COVID-19 pathogenesis. The current study was a prospective cross-section conducted on 188 participants classified into the following four groups: Group 1 COVID-19 (n = 47), Group 2 HCV (n = 47), and Group 3 HCV-COVID-19 patients (n = 47), besides the healthy control Group 4 (n = 47). The levels of acetylcholine, histamine, IL-18, and interferon-alpha were assayed using the ELISA method. Liver and kidney functions within all groups showed a marked alteration compared to the healthy control group. Our statistical analysis found that individuals with dual infection with HCV-COVID-19 had high ferritin levels compared to other biomarkers while those with COVID-19 infection had high levels of D-Dimer. The histamine, acetylcholine, and IL-18 biomarkers in both COVID-19 and dual HCV-COVID-19 groups have shown discriminatory power, making them potential diagnostic tests for infection. These three biomarkers showed satisfactory performance in identifying HCV infection. The IFN-Alpha test performed well in the HCV-COVID-19 group and was fair in the COVID-19 group, but it had little discriminative value in the HCV group. Moreover, our findings highlighted the pivotal role of acetylcholine, histamine, IL-18, and interferon-Alpha in HCV, COVID-19, and dual HCV-COVID-19 infection. Circulating levels of acetylcholine, histamine, IL-18, and interferon-Alpha can be potential early indicators for HCV, COVID-19, and dual HCV-COVID-19 infection. We acknowledge that further large multicenter experimental studies are needed to further investigate the role biomarkers play in influencing the likelihood of infection to confirm and extend our observations and to better understand and ultimately prevent or treat these diseases.">

In a cohort of 103 COVID-19 patients, we studied the relationship between the NfL and peripheral inflammatory markers. We found that the NfL levels are significantly predicted by a panel of circulating cytokines/chemokines, including CRP, IL-4, IL-8, IL-9, Eotaxin, and MIP-1ß, which are highly up-regulated during COVID-19 and are associated with clinical outcomes. Our findings show that peripheral cytokines influence the plasma levels of the NfL, suggesting a potential role of the NfL as a marker of neuronal damage associated with COVID-19 inflammation.">

        <tr id="Viral infection of cells leads to metabolic changes, but how viral infection changes whole-body and tissue metabolism in vivo has not been comprehensively studied. In particular, it is unknown how metabolism might be differentially affected by an acute infection that the immune system can successfully clear, compared to a chronic and persistent infection. Here we used metabolomics and isotope tracing to identify metabolic changes in mice infected with acute or chronic forms of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) for three or eight days. Both types of infection alter metabolite levels in blood and tissues, including itaconate and thymidine. However, we observed more dramatic metabolite changes in the blood and tissues of mice with chronic LCMV infection compared to those with acute infection. Isotope tracing revealed that the contribution of both glucose and glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle increase in the spleen, liver, and kidneys of mice infected with chronic LCMV, while acute LCMV only increases the contribution of glutamine to the TCA cycle in the spleen. We found that whole-body turnover of both glutamine and thymidine increase during acute and chronic infection, whereas whole-body glucose turnover was surprisingly unchanged. Activated T cells in vitro produce thymidine and mice with T cell leukemia display elevated serum thymidine, nominating T lymphocytes as the source of thymidine in LCMV infection. In sum, we provide comprehensive measurements of whole-body and tissue metabolism in acute and chronic viral infection, and identify altered thymidine metabolism as a marker of viral infection.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is characterized by excessive inflammation leading to the development of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) derived from ω6 and ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are central to the regulation of inflammation, controlling both its initiation and resolution. Still, their role in COVID-19 remains underexplored. By employing a holistic approach involving the analysis of white blood cell transcriptomes, targeted lipidomics, cytokine and immune cell profiling, across the spectrum of disease severity groups, including mild non-hospitalized patients and healthy individuals, we now show that LM networks are profoundly altered in COVID-19, correlate with inflammatory patterns, and stratify patients according to disease severity. Central to this are CYP450-derived LMs such as 20-HETE, lipid peroxidation metabolites such as iPF2a-VI, and lipoxygenase-derived LMs such as 12-HETE, all of which are major vasoactive mediators of inflammation. Among them, 20-HETE appears to be a promising prognostic biomarker for ICU admission and a potential therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 disease. Our study thus underscores the significance of LM networks in COVID-19 pathophysiology and sheds light into the broader mechanisms driving viral pneumonia in humans.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses are a genus of small RNA viruses that are responsible for approximately one billion global infections annually. These infections range in severity from the common cold and flu-like symptoms to more severe diseases, such as viral myocarditis, pancreatitis, and neurological disorders, that continue to pose a global health challenge with limited therapeutic strategies currently available. In the current study, we sought to understand the interaction between coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which is a model enterovirus, and macrophage cells, as there is limited understanding of how this virus interacts with macrophage innate immune cells. Our study demonstrated that CVB3 can robustly activate macrophages without apparent viral replication in these cells. We also showed that myeloid cells lacked the viral entry receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, the expression of exogenous CAR in RAW264.7 macrophages was unable to overcome the viral replication deficit. Interestingly, the CAR expression was associated with altered inflammatory responses during prolonged infection. Additionally, we identified the autophagy protein LC3 as a novel stimulus for macrophage activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CVB3-induced macrophage activation and its implications for viral pathogenesis.">

We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (CVOID-19) has varied clinical manifestations including mild to severe acute respiratory symptoms. Inflammasome complex and mitochondria play an important role in initiating inflammatory responses and could potentially be affected by this infection. To study the inflammasome and mitochondrial fission and fusion gene expression levels in COVID-19 patients, we designed this experiment. 
The inflammasome and mitochondrial gene expression profiles were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the peripheral blood of 70 hospitalized CVOID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms (HOSP) and 30 ICU patients with severe symptoms (ICU) compared to 20 healthy controls (HC). 
The results indicated that the expression of the dynamin-related protein-1 was extremely suppressed in HOSP while it came back to the normal range in the ICU group. However, the expression of fission 1 protein had a non-significant increase in HOSP and a decrease in the ICU group. The mitofusin-1 and dominant optic atrophy genes showed high expression levels (10-fold) and (70-fold), respectively, in the HOSP group. However, mitofusin-2 significantly decreased in both groups. Although leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 (NLRP3) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activating and recruitment domain genes dramatically increased in both groups (10 and 4-fold), other inflammasome genes declined in both groups. Finally, Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activate d B cells (NF-κB) extremely decreased, and Intreleukine-1 showed high expression in ICU patients (3-fold). 
CVOID-19 infection suppresses the fission genes and elevates the fusion gene expression in mitochondria, and it can cause activation of the inflammasome via the NLRP3 pathway.">

        <tr id="Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the severity of COVID-19, since the respiratory, thrombotic and myocardial complications of the disease are closely linked to vascular endothelial damage. To address this issue, we evaluate here the effect of conditioned media from spike S1-activated macrophages (CM_S1) on the proliferation of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), focusing on the specific role of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Results obtained demonstrate that the incubation with CM_S1 for 72 h hinders endothelial cell proliferation and induces signs of cytotoxicity. Comparable results are obtained upon exposure to IFN-γ + TNF-α, which are thus postulated to play a pivotal role in the effects observed. These events are associated with an increase in p21 protein and a decrease in Rb phosphorylation, as well as with the activation of IRF-1 and NF-kB transcription factors. Overall, these findings further sustain the pivotal role of a hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines as a trigger for endothelial activation and injury in the immune-mediated effects of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors are frequently observed to present persistent symptoms constituting what has been called “post-acute COVID-19 syndrome” (PACS) or “long COVID-19”. Some clinical risk factors have been identified to be associated with PACS development; however, specific mechanisms responsible for PACS pathology remain unknown. This study investigates clinical, immunological, and metabolomic risk factors associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) in 51 patients, assessed 7–19 months after acute infection. Among the participants, 62.7% were male and 37.2% were female, with an average age of 47.8 years. At the follow-up, 37.2% met the criteria for PACS, revealing significant differences in immunological and metabolomic profiles at the time of acute infection. Patients with PACS were characterized by elevated levels of mature low-density granulocytes (LDGs), interleukin-8 (IL-8), pyruvate, pseudouridine, and cystine. Baseline multivariate analysis showed increased pyruvate and decreased alpha tocopherol levels. At follow-up, there was a decrease in absolute B lymphocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid levels. These findings suggest that specific immunological and metabolomic markers during acute infection can help identify patients at higher risk of developing persistent PACS.">

        <tr id="Epithelial injury calls for a regenerative response from a coordinated network of epithelial stem cells and immune cells. Defining this network is key to preserving the repair process for acute resolution, but also for preventing a remodeling process with chronic dysfunction. We recently identified an immune niche for basal-epithelial stem cells using mouse models of injury after respiratory viral infection. Niche function depended on an early sentinel population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) that provided ligand GPNMB to basal-ESC receptor CD44 for reprogramming towards chronic lung disease. These same cell and molecular control points worked directly in mouse and human basal-ESC organoids, but the findings were not yet validated in vivo in human disease. Further, persistence of GPNMB expression in moDCs and M2-macrophages in mouse models suggested utility as a long-term disease biomarker in humans. Here we show increased expression of GPNMB localized to moDC-macrophage populations in lung tissue samples from long-term Covid, asthma, and COPD. The findings thereby provide initial evidence of a persistent and correctable pathway from acute injury to chronic disease with implications for cellular reprogramming and inflammatory memory.">

        <tr id="Diabetes significantly impacts the immune system; however, its role in worsening sepsis prognosis remains poorly understood. This study investigated the effect of hyperferritinemia on immune modulation in septic diabetic patients. A cohort study at Kyungpook National University Hospital stratified sepsis patients by diabetes status and followed them for 28 days. Additionally, CD4+ T cells from mice were analyzed for proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolic changes under ferritin treatment. Results from the clinical study showed higher ferritin levels in diabetic patients, and those with lower lymphocyte counts had increased mortality. In the mice study, ferritin inhibited T cell activation and proliferation by shifting metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation without increasing cell death. These findings suggest that the suppression of T cell proliferation due to elevated ferritin levels contributes to an immunosuppressive environment, leading to worse outcomes. In conclusion, hyperferritinemia is a biomarker for sepsis severity, particularly in diabetic patients, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies targeting ferritin levels or glycolytic pathways.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging flavivirus, is associated with devasting developmental and neurological disease outcomes particularly in infants infected in utero. Towards understanding the molecular underpinnings of the unique ZIKV disease pathologies, numerous transcriptome-wide studies have been undertaken. Notably, these studies have overlooked the assimilation of RNA-seq analysis from ZIKV-infected patients with cell culture model systems. In this study we find that ZIKV-infection of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, mirrored both the transcriptional and alternative splicing profiles from previously published RNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from pediatric patients during early acute, late acute, and convalescent phases of ZIKV infection. Our analyses show that ZIKV infection in cultured cells correlates with transcriptional changes in patients, while the overlap in alternative splicing profiles was not as extensive. Overall, our data indicate that cell culture model systems support dissection of select molecular changes detected in patients and establishes the groundwork for future studies elucidating the biological implications of alternative splicing during ZIKV infection.">

Many of these mitochondrial dysfunctions persist after recovery from treated or untreated viral infections, particularly when mitochondrial DNA is permanently damaged. Quantitative defects and structural rearrangements of mitochondrial DNA accumulate in post-mitotic tissues as recently reported long after SARS-CoV-2 or HIV infection, or following antiviral therapy. These observations are consistent with the "hit-and-run" concept proposed decades ago to explain viro-induced cell transformation and it could apply to delayed post-viral onsets of symptoms and advocate for complementary supportive care. Thus, according to this concept, following exposure to viruses or antiviral agents, mitochondrial damage could evolve into an autonomous clinical condition. It also establishes a pathogenic link between communicable and non-communicable chronic diseases.">

        <tr id="Post-COVID-19 condition is recognized as a multifactorial disorder, with persistent presence of viral antigens, discordant immunity, delayed viral clearance, and chronic inflammation. Obesity has emerged as an independent risk factor for both SARS-CoV-2 infection and its subsequent sequelae. In this study, we aimed to predict the molecular mechanisms linking obesity and post-COVID-19 distress. Viral antigen-exposed adipose tissues display remarkable levels of viral receptors, facilitating viral entry, deposition, and chronic release of inflammatory mediators and cells in patients. Subsequently, obesity-associated inflammatory insults are predicted to disturb cellular and humoral immunity by triggering abnormal cell differentiation and lymphocyte exhaustion. In particular, the decline in SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and T-cell exhaustion due to chronic inflammation may account for delayed virus clearance and persistent activation of inflammatory responses. Taken together, obesity-associated defective immunity is a critical control point of intervention against post-COVID-19 progression, particularly in subjects with chronic metabolic distress.">

        <tr id="Abstract The poor prognosis observed in elderly individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) remains a serious clinical burden and the underlying mechanism is unclear, which necessities detailed investigation of disease characteristics and research for efficient countermeasures. To simulate lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in senescent human patients, 80‐week‐old male hamsters are intranasally inoculated with different doses of SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 variant. Exposure to a low dose of the Omicron BA.5 variant results in early activation of the innate immune response, followed by rapid viral clearance and minimal lung damage. However, a high dose of BA.5 results in impaired interferon signaling, cytokine storm, uncontrolled viral replication, and severe lung injury. To decrease viral load and reverse the deterioration of COVID‐19, a new bio‐mimic decoy called CoVR‐MV is used as a preventive or therapeutic agent. Administration of CoVR‐MV as a preventive or therapeutic intervention in the early stages of infection can effectively suppress viral load, regulate the immune response, and rescue animals from death and critical illness. These findings underscore the risk associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 exposure in senescent hamsters and highlight the importance of early intervention to prevent disease progression.">

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Aims SARS‐CoV‐2 causes systemic immune dysfunction, leading to severe respiratory dysfunction and multiorgan dysfunction. Granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) therapy is designed to regulate an excessive inflammatory response and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We aimed to investigate a targeted subset of granulocytes and monocytes to be removed after GMA therapy in patients with severe COVID‐19 infection. Methods We established an ex vivo experimental system to study the effects of GMA. Blood samples were collected into EDTA‐treated tubes and a mixture of blood samples and cellulose acetate beads was used in GMA. After GMA, blood samples were removed, and the granulocyte and monocyte subtypes before and after GMA were determined by CyTOF mass cytometry. To analyze mass cytometry data with a self‐organizing map, hierarchical clustering was used to determine the appropriate number of metaclusters from t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results We included seven patients with severe COVID‐19 and four age‐ and sex‐matched volunteers. Granulocyte subsets removed by GMA strongly expressed CD11b, CD16, and CD66b, and weakly expressed CD11c, consistent with mature and activated neutrophils. Monocyte subsets strongly expressed CD14, weakly expressed CD33 and CD45RO, and did not express CD16. These subsets were indicated to promote the release of inflammatory cytokines and activate T cells. Conclusions The identification of the granulocyte and monocyte subsets removed after GMA in patients with severe COVID‐19 may help explain the potential mechanism underlying the effectiveness of GMA in COVID‐19 and other inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in millions of deaths globally. Adults with immunosuppression (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients) and those undergoing active cancer treatments experience worse infections and more severe COVID-19. It is difficult to conduct clinical studies in these populations, resulting in a restricted amount of data that can be used to relate mechanisms of immune dysfunction to COVID-19 outcomes in these vulnerable groups. To study immune dynamics after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to investigate drivers of COVID-19 severity in individuals with cancer and immunosuppression, we adapted our mathematical model of the immune response during COVID-19 and generated virtual patient cohorts of cancer and immunosuppressed patients. The cohorts of plausible patients recapitulated available longitudinal clinical data collected from patients in Montréal, Canada area hospitals. Our model predicted that both cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients with severe COVID-19 had decreased CD8+ T cells, elevated interleukin-6 concentrations, and delayed type I interferon peaks compared to those with mild COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, our results suggest that cancer patients experience higher viral loads (however, with no direct relation with severity), likely because of decreased initial neutrophil counts (i.e., neutropenia), a frequent toxic side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, severe cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients suffered a high degree of tissue damage associated with elevated neutrophils. Lastly, parameter values associated with monocyte recruitment by infected cells were found to be elevated in severe cancer and immunosuppressed patients with respect to the COVID-19 reference group. Together, our study highlights that dysfunction in type I interferon and CD8+ T cells are key drivers of immune dysregulation in COVID-19, particularly in cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection represents a global health problem and is characterized by formation of granuloma with a necrotic center and a systemic inflammatory response. Inflammasomes have a crucial role in the host immune response towards Mtb. These intracellular multi-protein complexes are assembled in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Inflammasome platforms activate caspases, leading to the maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and 18 and the cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming protein responsible for cytokine release and pyroptotic cell death. Recent in vitro and in vivo findings have highlighted the importance of inflammasome signaling and subsequent necrotic cell death in Mtb-infected innate immune cells. However, we are just beginning to understand how inflammasomes contribute to disease or to a protective immune response in tuberculosis (TB). A detailed molecular understanding of inflammasome-associated pathomechanisms may foster the development of novel host-directed therapeutics or vaccines with improved activity. In this mini-review, we discuss the regulatory and molecular aspects of inflammasome activation and the associated immunological consequences for Mtb pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Global amphibian declines are compounded by deadly disease outbreaks caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Much has been learned about the roles of amphibian skin-produced antimicrobial components and microbiomes in controlling Bd, yet almost nothing is known about the roles of skin-resident immune cells in anti-Bd defenses. Mammalian mast cells reside within and serve as key immune sentinels in barrier tissues like skin. Accordingly, we investigated the roles of Xenopus laevis frog mast cells during Bd infections. Our findings indicate that enrichment of X. laevis skin mast cells confers anti-Bd protection and ameliorates the inflammation-associated skin damage caused by Bd infection. This includes a significant reduction in infiltration of Bd-infected skin by neutrophils, promoting mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands, and preventing Bd-mediated changes to skin microbiomes. Mammalian mast cells are known for their production of the pleiotropic interleukin-4 (IL4) cytokine and our findings suggest that the X. laevis IL4 plays a key role in manifesting the effects seen following cutaneous mast cell enrichment. Together, this work underscores the importance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in anti-Bd defenses and illuminates a novel avenue for investigating amphibian host–chytrid pathogen interactions.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is a significant global health concern due to its association with neurodevelopmental disorders such as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). This study aimed to compare the replication kinetics, viral persistence, cytopathogenic effects, and immune gene expression in human microglia cells (CHME-3) infected with an Asian lineage ZIKV (PRVABC59, referred to as ZIKV-PRV) and an African lineage ZIKV (IBH30656, referred to as ZIKV-IBH). We found that ZIKV-PRV replicated more efficiently and persisted longer while inducing lower levels of cell death and inflammatory gene activation compared with ZIKV-IBH. These findings suggest that the enhanced replication and persistence of ZIKV-PRV, along with its ability to evade innate immune responses, may underlie its increased neuropathogenic potential, especially in the context of CZS. In contrast, ZIKV-IBH, with its stronger immune gene activation and higher cytopathogenicity, may lead to more acute infections with faster viral clearance, thereby reducing the likelihood of chronic central nervous system (CNS) infection. This study provides crucial insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving the differential pathogenicity of ZIKV lineages and highlights the need for further research to pinpoint the viral factors responsible for these distinct clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the critical need to integrate immunomics within the One Health framework to effectively address zoonotic diseases across humans, animals, and environments. Employing advanced high-throughput technologies, this interdisciplinary approach reveals the complex immunological interactions among these systems, enhancing our understanding of immune responses and yielding vital insights into the mechanisms that influence viral spread and host susceptibility. Significant advancements in immunomics have accelerated vaccine development, improved viral mutation tracking, and broadened our comprehension of immune pathways in zoonotic transmissions. This review highlights the role of animals, not merely as carriers or reservoirs, but as essential elements of ecological networks that profoundly influence viral epidemiology. Furthermore, we explore how environmental factors shape immune response patterns across species, influencing viral persistence and spillover risks. Moreover, case studies demonstrating the integration of immunogenomic data within the One Health framework for COVID-19 are discussed, outlining its implications for future research. However, linking humans, animals, and the environment through immunogenomics remains challenging, including the complex management of vast amounts of data and issues of scalability. Despite challenges, integrating immunomics data within the One Health framework significantly enhances our strategies and responses to zoonotic diseases and pandemic threats, marking a crucial direction for future public health breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic significantly transformed the field of mathematical modeling in immunology. International collaboration among numerous research groups yielded a substantial amount of experimental data, which greatly facilitated model validation and led to the development of new mathematical models. The aim of the study is an improvement of system understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the development of a modular mathematical model which provides a foundation for further research on host-pathogen interactions. We utilized the open-source BioUML platform to develop a model using ordinary, delay and stochastic differential equations. The model was validated using experimental data from middle-aged individuals with moderate COVID-19 progression, including measurements of viral load, antibodies, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and interleukin-6 levels. Parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis were conducted to refine the model’s accuracy. The model effectively reproduces moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 progressions, consistent with experimental observations. We investigated the efficiency and contributions of innate and adaptive immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed immune system behavior during co-infection with HIV and organ transplantation. Additionally, we studied therapy methods, such as interferon administration. The developed model can be employed as a framework for simulating other infectious diseases taking into account follow-up immune response. Author summary Despite the significant progress reached in understanding of COVID-19, traditional methods still struggle to analyze and interpret the extensive and sometimes controversial experimental data on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mathematical and systems biology approaches attempt to address this challenge by developing mathematical models of the immune response. We aimed not only to investigate the disease at a systemic level but also to provide a framework for further research on host-pathogen interactions, both existing and forthcoming. To achieve this, we constructed a model incorporating both innate and adaptive immunity, as well as cellular and humoral components. This together allowed us to conduct a series of in silico experiments, exploring the immune response across various levels and compartments. The results of these investigations offer valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the immune system and can guide future research and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="In atopic dermatitis (AD), lesional skin is frequently colonized by Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, contributing to the severity and clinical symptoms of the disease. The inflammatory milieu in the skin is characterized by a type 2 inflammatory signature, including M2 macrophages, which cannot eradicate S. aureus. Since S. aureus is effectively controlled in macrophages activated by pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced NF-κB and interferon (IFN)-γ-induced STAT1 stimulation, we hypothesized that pre-treatment with LPS as a PRR/TLR4-activating agent and IFN-γ would induce effective control of S. aureus in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) of AD patients. Our data show that the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD is strongly expressed in skin macrophages and MDMs from AD patients compared to healthy controls and impairs the anti-staphylococcal activity of PRR-activated and IFN-treated MDMs. Functionally, CYLD impaired M1 macrophage polarization, as evidenced by reduced expression of CD80, TNF, and IL-6 upon LPS- and IFN-γ treatment in CYLD-deficient as compared to wild-type (WT) MDM/THP1 macrophages. Mechanistically, CYLD inhibited IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and activation by binding to STAT1 and inducing its K63 deubiquitination. CYLD also interacted with TRAF6 and NEMO/IKKγ in the MYD88 signaling pathway and with RIPK2 in the NOD2 pathway, leading to impaired activation of NF-κB. Inhibition of both STAT1 by siRNA and NF-κB by IKK inhibitor treatment, respectively, independently abolished the control of S. aureus in both CYLD-deficient and WT THP1 macrophages, which harbored identical high numbers of the pathogen. The in vivo inhibitory function of CYLD on the control of S. aureus was also observed upon infection of Cyld-deficient and WT mice. Collectively, these data illustrate that the increased expression of CYLD in macrophages of AD patients is a factor contributing to the ineffective control of S. aureus, diminishes M1 macrophage polarization, and that CYLD deletion unleashes the break on effective STAT1 and NF-κB-dependent control of S. aureus.">

        <tr id="Antiretroviral drugs have made significant progress in treating HIV-1 and improving the quality of HIV-1-infected individuals. However, due to their limited permeability into the brain HIV-1 replication persists in brain reservoirs such as perivascular macrophages and microglia, which cause HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders. Therefore, it is highly desirable to find a novel therapy that can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and target HIV-1 pathogenesis in brain reservoirs. A recently developed 2-amino-3-methylpentanoic acid [2-morpholin-4-yl-ethyl]-amide (LM11A-31), which is a p75 neutrotrophin receptor (p75NTR) modulator, can cross the BBB. In this study, we examined whether LM11A-31 treatment can suppress HIV-1 replication, oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and inflammatory response in macrophages. Our results showed that LM11A-31 (100 nM) alone and/or in combination with positive control darunavir (5.5 µM) significantly suppresses viral replication and reduces cytotoxicity. Moreover, the HIV-1 suppression by LM11A-31 was comparable to the HIV-1 suppression by darunavir. Although p75NTR was upregulated in HIV-1-infected macrophages compared to uninfected macrophages, LM11A-31 did not significantly reduce the p75NTR expression in macrophages. Furthermore, our study illustrated that LM11A-31 alone and/or in combination with darunavir significantly suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF-α and chemokines MCP-1 in HIV-induced macrophages. The suppression of these cytokines and chemokines by LM11A-31 was comparable to darunavir. In contrast, LM11A-31 did not significantly alter oxidative stress, expression of antioxidant enzymes, or autophagy marker proteins in U1 macrophages. The results suggest that LM11A-31, which can cross the BBB, has therapeutic potential in suppressing HIV-1 and inflammatory response in brain reservoirs, especially in macrophages.">

        <tr id="Abstract The regulation of inflammation is a critical aspect of disease tolerance and naturally acquired clinical immunity to malaria. Here, we demonstrate using RNA sequencing and epigenetic landscape profiling by cytometry by time-of-flight, that the regulation of inflammatory pathways during asymptomatic parasitemia occurs downstream of pathogen sensing—at the epigenetic level. The abundance of certain epigenetic markers (methylation of H3K27 and dimethylation of arginine residues) and decreased prevalence of histone variant H3.3 correlated with suppressed cytokine responses among monocytes of Ugandan children. Such an epigenetic signature was observed across diverse immune cell populations and not only characterized active asymptomatic parasitemia but also correlated with future long-term disease tolerance and clinical immunity when observed in uninfected children. Pseudotime analyses revealed a potential trajectory of epigenetic change that correlated with a child's age and recent parasite exposure and paralleled the acquisition of clinical immunity. Thus, our data support a model whereby exposure to Plasmodium falciparum induces epigenetic changes that regulate excessive inflammation and contribute to naturally acquire clinical immunity to malaria.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

Identifying biomarkers, particularly extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived microRNAs (miRNAs), is vital for comprehending their response to COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate specific EV-miRNAs in the plasma of cancer patients under active treatment who received the COVID-19 booster vaccine. The selected miRNAs (EV-hsa-miR-7-5p, EV-hsa-miR-15b-5p, EV-hsa-miR-24-3p, EV-hsa-miR-145- 5p, and EV-hsa-miR-223-3p) are involved in regulating SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and cytokine release, making them potential biomarkers for vaccination response. The study involved 54 cancer patients. Plasma and serum samples were collected at pre-boost vaccination, and at 3 and 6 months post-boost vaccination. Anti-spike antibody levels were measured. Additionally, RNA was extracted from EVs isolated from plasma and the expression levels of miRNAs were assessed. The results showed a significantly positive antibody response after COVID-19 boost vaccination. The expression levels of EV-hsa-miR-7-5p, EV-hsa-miR-15b-5p, EV-hsa-miR-24-3p, and EV-hsa-miR-223-3p increased significantly after 6 months of COVID-19 booster vaccination. Interestingly, an increased expression of certain EV-hsa-miRNAs was positively correlated. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these correlated miRNAs play a critical role in regulating the targets present in antiviral responses and cytokine production. These findings suggest that EV-hsa-miR-15b-5p, EV-hsa-miR-24-3p, and EV-hsa-miR-223-3p may be crucial in immune response induced by mRNA vaccines.">

M. fortuitum introduced into the alveolar channel primarily infected macrophages, with rare bacteria inside alveolar cells. Bulk-RNA sequencing of infected chips revealed marked upregulation of transcripts for cytokines, chemokines and secreted protease inhibitors (SERPINs).

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound impact on global health. Rapid and accurate diagnostic tools are crucial for effective disease control and management. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has emerged as a reliable and widely used method for detecting COVID-19 antibodies in patients, which develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the ELISA technique is effective in identifying the presence of antibodies and thus confirming exposure to the virus, its role in predicting the clinical course and severity of the disease is limited. ELISA primarily confirms prior exposure to the virus or vaccination status, but it does not directly correlate antibody levels with the severity or progression of the disease. The variability in clinical outcomes is influenced by factors such as viral load, patient co-morbidities, genetic predispositions, and the timing of the immune response. ELISA has diverse applications in epidemiology, vaccination assessment, and therapeutic development. It determines antibody prevalence, aids in surveillance, and evaluates vaccine effectiveness and antibody protection duration. ELISA quantitatively measures antibody levels, providing insights into the immune response and treatment efficacy. Challenges include specialized facilities and personnel, cross-reactivity, and false results. Multiplex assays and integration with other diagnostics are future directions. In summary, ELISA is an essential tool in COVID-19 diagnostics, enabling precise assessment of the immune response and contributing to effective strategies. The development of point-of-care devices that integrate ELISA technology could enable rapid and accessible testing in various settings. Additionally, integrating ELISA with other diagnostic platforms could enhance the overall diagnostic capabilities for COVID-19. Despite challenges, ongoing advancements in ELISA technology, and its integration with other diagnostic approaches, hold promise for further improving COVID-19 diagnostics and management strategies.">

As the world is recovering from the effect of the coronavirus, the concept of post-COVID-19 syndrome has emerged. Multiple organ systems have been implicated, including the liver. We aim to identify and analyze the reported cases of severe and long-term parenchymal liver injury post-COVID-19 infection. Several databases were used to conduct a comprehensive literature search to target studies reporting cases of severe and long-term parenchymal liver injury post-COVID-19 infection. Screening, data extraction, and cross checking were performed by two independent reviewers. Only 22 studies met our inclusion criteria. Our results revealed that liver steatosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cirrhosis were the most reported liver associated complications post-COVID-19 infection. Moreover, complications like acute liver failure, hepatitis, and liver hemorrhage were also reported. The mechanism of liver injury post-COVID-19 infection is not fully understood. The leading proposed mechanisms include the involvement of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor expressed in the liver and the overall inflammatory state caused by COVID-19 infection. Future studies should incorporate longer follow-up periods, spanning several years, for better insight into the progression and management of such diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a bidirectional relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes mellitus. Existing evidence strongly suggests hyperglycemia as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Conversely, recent studies have reported new-onset diabetes following SARS-CoV-2 infection, hinting at a potential direct viral attack on pancreatic beta cells. In this review, we explore how hyperglycemia, a hallmark of diabetes, might influence SARS-CoV-2 entry and accessory proteins in pancreatic β-cells. We examine how the virus may enter and manipulate such cells, focusing on the role of the spike protein and its interaction with host receptors. Additionally, we analyze potential effects on endosomal processing and accessory proteins involved in viral infection. Our analysis suggests a complex interplay between hyperglycemia and SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic β-cells. Understanding these mechanisms may help unlock urgent therapeutic strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of COVID-19 in diabetic patients and unveil if the virus itself can trigger diabetes onset.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The distinct functions of immune cells in atherosclerosis have been mostly defined by preclinical mouse studies. Contrastingly, the immune cell composition of human atherosclerotic plaques and their contribution to disease progression is only poorly understood. It remains uncertain whether genetic animal models allow for valuable translational approaches.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to define the immune cell landscape in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The human immune cell repertoire demonstrated an unexpectedly high heterogeneity and was dominated by cells of the T-cell lineage, a finding confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Bioinformatical integration with 7 mouse scRNA-seq data sets from adventitial and atherosclerotic vascular tissue revealed a total of 51 identities of cell types and differentiation states, of which some were only poorly conserved between species and exclusively found in humans. Locations, frequencies, and transcriptional programs of immune cells in mouse models did not resemble the immune cell landscape in human carotid atherosclerosis. In contrast to standard mouse models of atherosclerosis, human plaque leukocytes were dominated by several T-cell phenotypes with transcriptional hallmarks of T-cell activation and memory formation, T-cell receptor-, and pro-inflammatory signaling. Only mice at the age of 22 months partially resembled the activated T-cell phenotype. In a validation cohort of 43 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, the abundance of activated immune cell subsets in the plaque defined by multi-color flow cytometry associated with the extend of clinical atherosclerosis.


CONCLUSIONS
Integrative scRNA-seq reveals a substantial difference in the immune cell composition of murine and human carotid atherosclerosis - a finding that questions the translational value of standard mouse models for adaptive immune cell studies. Clinical associations suggest a specific role for T-cell driven (auto-) immunity in human plaque formation and -instability.">

        <tr id="Various symptoms have been reported to persist beyond the acute phase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which is referred to as long coronavirus disease 19 (long COVID-19). Over 65 million individuals suffer from long COVID-19. However, the causes of long COVID-19 are largely unknown. Since long COVID-19 symptoms are observed throughout the body, vascular endothelial dysfunction is a strong candidate explaining the induction of long COVID-19. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is ubiquitously expressed in endothelial cells. We previously found that the risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and a history of ASCVD raise the risk of severe COVID-19, suggesting a contribution of pre-existing endothelial dysfunction to severe COVID-19. Here, we show a significant association of endothelial dysfunction with the development of long COVID-19 and show that biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction in patients with long COVID-19 are also crucial players in the development of ASCVD. We consider the influence of long COVID-19 on the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ASCVD. Future assessments of the outcomes of long COVID-19 in patients resulting from therapeutic interventions that improve endothelial function may imply the significance of endothelial dysfunction in the development of long COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Mayaro (MAYV) viruses are arthritogenic alphaviruses that promote an incapacitating and long-lasting inflammatory muscle–articular disease. Despite studies pointing out the importance of skeletal muscle (SkM) in viral pathogenesis, the long-term consequences on its physiology and the mechanism of persistence of symptoms are still poorly understood. Combining molecular, morphological, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and histological analysis, we conduct a temporal investigation of CHIKV and MAYV replication in a wild-type mice model, focusing on the impact on SkM composition, structure, and repair in the acute and late phases of infection. We found that viral replication and induced inflammation promote a rapid loss of muscle mass and reduction in fiber cross-sectional area by upregulation of muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and Atrogin-1 expression, both key regulators of SkM fibers atrophy. Despite a reduction in inflammation and clearance of infectious viral particles, SkM atrophy persists until 30 days post-infection. The genomic CHIKV and MAYV RNAs were still detected in SkM in the late phase, along with the upregulation of chemokines and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. In agreement with the involvement of inflammatory mediators on induced atrophy, the neutralization of TNF and a reduction in oxidative stress using monomethyl fumarate, an agonist of Nrf2, decreases atrogen expression and atrophic fibers while increasing weight gain in treated mice. These data indicate that arthritogenic alphavirus infection could chronically impact body SkM composition and also harm repair machinery, contributing to a better understanding of mechanisms of arthritogenic alphavirus pathogenesis and with a description of potentially new targets of therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Abstract Perivascular macrophages (PVMs) and, to a lesser degree, microglia are targets and reservoirs of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in the brain. Previously, we demonstrated that colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) in PVMs was upregulated and activated in chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques with encephalitis, correlating with SIV infection of PVMs. Herein, we investigated the role of CSF1R in the brain during acute SIV infection using BLZ945, a brain-penetrant CSF1R kinase inhibitor. Apart from three uninfected historic controls, nine Indian rhesus macaques were infected acutely with SIVmac251 and divided into three groups (n = 3 each): an untreated control and two groups treated for 20–30 days with low- (10 mg/kg/day) or high- (30 mg/kg/day) dose BLZ945. With the high-dose BLZ945 treatment, there was a significant reduction in cells expressing CD163 and CD206 across all four brain areas examined, compared with the low-dose treatment and control groups. In 9 of 11 tested regions, tissue viral DNA (vDNA) loads were reduced by 95%–99% following at least one of the two doses, and even to undetectable levels in some instances. Decreased numbers of CD163+ and CD206+ cells correlated significantly with lower levels of vDNA in all four corresponding brain areas. In contrast, BLZ945 treatment did not significantly affect the number of microglia. Our results indicate that doses as low as 10 mg/kg/day of BLZ945 are sufficient to reduce the tissue vDNA loads in the brain with no apparent adverse effect. This study provides evidence that infected PVMs are highly sensitive to CSF1R inhibition, opening new possibilities to achieve viral clearance.">

        <tr id="Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus infection affecting half of the world’s population for which therapies are lacking. The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who will progress to severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. In patients with overweight/obesity these signatures are exacerbated compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic capacity compared to non-SD. Furthermore, type-I Interferon signalling is downregulated in SD, suggesting defective virus-sensing mechanisms may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional “professional killer” T/NK-cells underpin dengue pathogenesis. Our findings pave the way for the evaluation of immunomodulatory therapies for dengue.">

        <tr id="The re-emergence of the Mpox (formerly monkeypox) in 2022 in non-endemic countries has raised many concerns for global health due to its high transmissibility and mortality rate. A major challenge in fighting Mpox is its ability to evade the host's innate immune system, which is the first line of defense against viral infections. Mpox encodes various proteins that interfere with key antiviral pathways and mechanisms, such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, cytokine production, complement and inflammasome activation, and chemokine binding. These proteins modulate the expression and function of innate immune mediators, such as interferons, interleukins, and toll-like receptors, and impair the recruitment and activation of innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells. By suppressing or altering these innate immune responses, Mpox enhances its replication and infection in the host tissues and organs, leading to systemic inflammation, tissue damage, and organ failure. This study reveals new insights into the molecular and cellular interactions between Mpox and the host's innate immunity and identifies potential targets and strategies for antiviral interventions.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cryptococcosis, caused by fungi of the genus Cryptococcus, manifests in a broad range of clinical presentations, including severe pneumonia and disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues (bone and skin). Immune deficiency or development of overexuberant inflammatory responses can result in increased susceptibility or host damage, respectively, during fungal encounters. Leukotrienes help regulate inflammatory responses against fungal infections. Nevertheless, studies showed that Cryptococcus exploits host 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), an enzyme central to the metabolism of arachidonic acid into leukotrienes, to facilitate transmigration across the brain–blood barrier. To investigate the impact of host 5-LO on the development of protective host immune responses and mortality during cryptococcosis, wild-type (C57BL/6) and 5-lipoxygenase-deficient (5-LO−/−) mice were given experimental pulmonary and systemic Cryptococcus sp., infections. Our results showed that 5-LO−/− mice exhibited reduced pathology and better disease outcomes (i.e., no mortality or signs associated with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis) following pulmonary infection with C. deneoformans, despite having detectable yeast in the brain tissues. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice exhibited classical signs associated with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. Additionally, brain tissues of 5-LO−/− mice exhibited lower levels of cytokines (CCL2 and CCL3) clinically associated with Cryptococcus-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS). In a systemic mouse model of cryptococcosis, 5-LO−/− mice and those treated with a Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 5-LO synthesis inhibitor, zileuton, displayed significantly reduced mortality compared to C57BL/6 infected mice. These results suggest that therapeutics designed to inhibit host 5-LO signaling could reduce disease pathology and mortality associated with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcosis is a mycosis with worldwide distribution and has a broad range of clinical manifestations, including diseases of the CNS. Globally, there is an estimated 179,000 cases of cryptococcal meningitis, resulting in approximately 112,000 fatalities per annum and 19% of AIDS-related deaths. Understanding how host immune responses are modulated during cryptococcosis is central to mitigating the morbidity and mortality associated with cryptococcosis. Leukotrienes (LTs) have been shown to modulate inflammatory responses during infection. In this study, we show that mice deficient in 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), an enzyme central to the metabolism of arachidonic acid into leukotrienes, exhibit reduced pathology, disease, and neurological signs associated with cryptococcal meningitis. Additionally, mice given an experimental cryptococcal infection and subsequently treated with an FDA-approved 5-LO synthesis inhibitor exhibited significantly reduced mortality rates. These results suggest that therapeutics designed to inhibit host 5-LO activity could significantly reduce pathology and mortality rates associated with cryptococcal meningitis.">

        <tr id="Frequent viral infections leading to infectious disease outbreaks have become a significant global health concern. Fully elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the immune response against viral infections is crucial for epidemic prevention and control. The innate immune response, the host's primary defense against viral infection, plays a pivotal role and has become a breakthrough in research mechanisms. A component of the innate immune system, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are involved in inducing inflammatory responses to viral infections. Numerous DAMPs are released from virally infected cells, activating downstream signaling pathways via internal and external receptors on immune cells. This activation triggers immune responses and helps regulate viral host invasion. This review examines the immune regulatory mechanisms of various DAMPs, such as the S100 protein family, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and heat shock proteins, in various viral infections to provide a theoretical basis for designing novel antiviral drugs.">

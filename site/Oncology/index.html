        <tr id="The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has threatened human health worldwide. Among protective immune reactions, T cell responses are diverse among individuals, which is related to the differences in severity. A T cell subset, regulatory T (Treg) cells, is crucial for limiting excessive immune responses. If SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs are developed during infection, they may counteract anti-viral immunity and cause severe symptom. To address this possibility, we conducted single-cell TCR-RNA-sequencing of PBMCs from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Among thirteen donors, one with severe symptom had substantially more FOXP3-expressing Treg clonotypes activated in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virion or other major antigen proteins. To define the reactivity of these Treg clonotypes, fifteen highly expanded Treg clonotypes were reconstituted into reporter cells and stimulated with 27 distinct peptide pools that cover all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However, none of these clonotypes react to any SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Instead, the reporter cells expressing one TCR clonotype (23599) were activated in the presence of EBV-transformed B cells without adding exogenous antigens. Furthermore, 23599 TCR-expressing cells were activated by non-transformed naïve syngenic B cells in DQA1*03:03-DQB1*04:01-dependent manner, suggesting that clonotype 23599 may be autoreactive. This Treg clonotype, 23599, was also detected in a public TCR database, and significantly expanded in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not the dominant antigen inducing Treg during infection.">

        <tr id="At this stage in the COVID-19 pandemic, most infections are "breakthrough" infections that occur in individuals with prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. To refine long-term vaccine strategies against emerging variants, we examined both innate and adaptive immunity in breakthrough infections. We performed single-cell transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional profiling of primary and breakthrough infections to compare immune responses from unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals during the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave. Breakthrough infections were characterized by a less activated transcriptomic profile in monocytes and natural killer cells, with induction of pathways limiting monocyte migratory potential and natural killer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed a female-specific increase in transcriptomic and proteomic activation of multiple innate immune cell subsets during breakthrough infections. These insights suggest that prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prevents overactivation of innate immune responses during breakthrough infections with discernible sex-specific patterns and underscore the potential of harnessing vaccines in mitigating pathologic immune responses resulting from overactivation.">

        <tr id="Severity of COVID-19 is affected by multiple factors; however, it is not understood how the inflammatory milieu of the lung at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure affects the control of viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that immune events in the mouse lung closely preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection affect viral control and identify innate immune pathways that limit viral replication. Pulmonary inflammatory stimuli including resolved, antecedent respiratory infections with Staphylococcus aureus or influenza, ongoing pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, ovalbumin/alum-induced asthma, or airway administration of TLR ligands and recombinant cytokines all establish an antiviral state in the lung that restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to antiviral type I interferons, TNFα and IL-1 potently precondition the lung for enhanced viral control. Our work shows that SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from an immunologically quiescent lung microenvironment and suggests that heterogeneity in pulmonary inflammation preceding SARS-CoV-2 exposure may contribute to variability in disease outcomes.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is accompanied by elevated liver enzymes, and patients with pre‐existing liver conditions experience more severe disease. While it was known that SARS‐CoV‐2 infects human hepatocytes, our study determines the mechanism of infection, demonstrates viral replication and spread, and highlights direct hepatocyte damage. Viral replication was readily detectable upon infection of primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells with the ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2, Delta, and Omicron variants. Hepatocytes express the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor ACE2 and the host cell protease TMPRSS2, and knocking down ACE2 and TMPRSS2 impaired SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Progeny viruses released from infected hepatocytes showed the typical coronavirus morphology by electron microscopy and proved infectious when transferred to fresh cells, indicating that hepatocytes can contribute to virus spread. Importantly, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection rapidly induced hepatocyte death in a replication‐dependent fashion, with the Omicron variant showing faster onset but less extensive cell death. C57BL/6 wild‐type mice infected with a mouse‐adapted SARS‐CoV‐2 strain showed high levels of viral RNA in liver and lung tissues. ALT peaked when viral RNA was cleared from the liver. Liver histology revealed profound tissue damage and immune cell infiltration, indicating that direct cytopathic effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 and immune‐mediated killing of infected hepatocytes contribute to liver pathology.">

        <tr id="Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations in infants and poses a significantly higher risk of respiratory failure than SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. We analyzed blood samples from infants (median age 2.3 months) with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 30), RSV (n = 19), and healthy controls (n = 17) using single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, and cytokine profiling. Both viruses triggered comparable interferon responses across PBMC subsets but differed in NK cell and inflammatory responses. Severe RSV cases showed reduced NK cell frequencies, lower IFNG expression, and decreased chromatin accessibility at T-BET and EOMES binding sites. RSV infections were also associated with increased CD4 + T EMRA , memory T reg and transitional B cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was characterized by stronger pro-inflammatory signatures, including increased NFKB pathway activity and higher serum TNF concentrations. These findings highlight distinct immune responses to RSV and SARS-CoV-2, providing insights that may inform clinical decisions.">

        <tr id="Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has been the most severe public health emergency since 2019. Currently, the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the most dominant. The most prominent symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory. Meanwhile, the fatality of COVID-19 was mainly from pneumonia. However ,in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have pneumonia and those who do not, the differences in the immune repertoire still require further investigation. Methods We conducted seven-chain adaptome immune repertoire analyses on patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, both with and without pulmonary infiltration. Results Patients with pulmonary infiltration exhibit lymphopenia, a decreased proportion of the overall TCR repertoire alongside an increased BCR repertoire, reduced IGHD and IGHM isotype expression, a shorter mean CDR3 length for TRG, and a longer mean length for TRD, as well as diminished clonality and diversity in the TCR/BCR repertoire. Meanwhile, patients with pulmonary infiltration have distinct V-J gene usage and unique CDR3 signature, as well as BCR class switch recombination pattern. Finally, prior vaccination triggered less BCR IGHM/IGHD somatic hypermutation response, preserved the diversity of the entire adaptive immune repertoire, and provided clinical protection against severe or critical conditions following Omicron infection. Discussion We report a unique, comprehensive adaptive immune system signature in patients with pulmonary infiltration, which may serve as potential immunological biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Current understanding of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and host responses driving the pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate gene expression patterns during acute SARS-CoV-2 illness. Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples. We also generated expression data on the human nose organoid model during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The human nose organoid-generated host transcriptional response captured many aspects of responses observed in the above patient samples, while suggesting the existence of distinct host responses to SARS-CoV-2 depending on the cellular context, involving both epithelial and cellular immune responses. Our findings provide a catalog of SARS-CoV-2 host response genes changing over time and magnitude of these host responses were significantly correlated to viral load.">

        <tr id="Few pathogens have historically been subjected to as intense scientific and clinical scrutiny as SARS-CoV-2. The genetic, immunological, and environmental factors influencing disease severity and post-infection clinical outcomes, known as correlates of immunity, remain largely undefined. Clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to those with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms. While most infected individuals return to their former health and fitness within a few weeks, some develop debilitating chronic symptoms, referred to as long-COVID. Autoimmune responses have been proposed as one of the factors influencing long-COVID and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between viral infections and autoimmune pathologies is not new. Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, among others, have been shown to induce the production of autoantibodies and the onset of autoimmune conditions. Given the extensive literature on SARS-CoV-2, here we review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmune pathologies, with a focus on autoantibodies. We closely examine mechanisms driving autoantibody production, particularly their connection with disease severity and long-COVID.">

Coronavirus interactions with host innate immune antiviral responses are an important determinant of disease outcome. This review compares the host's innate response to different human coronaviruses. Host antiviral defenses discussed in this review include frontline defenses against respiratory viruses in the nasal epithelium, early sensing of viral infection by innate immune effectors, double-stranded RNA and stress-induced antiviral pathways, and viral antagonism of innate immune responses conferred by conserved coronavirus nonstructural proteins and genus-specific accessory proteins. The common cold coronaviruses HCoV-229E and -NL63 induce robust interferon signaling and related innate immune pathways, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 induce intermediate levels of activation, and MERS-CoV shuts down these pathways almost completely.">

        <tr id="Introduction The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, notably delta and omicron, has significantly accelerated the global pandemic, worsening conditions worldwide. However, there is a lack of research concerning the molecular mechanisms related to immune responses and metabolism induced by these variants. Methods Here, metabolomics combined with transcriptomics was performed to elucidate the immunometabolic changes in the lung of hamsters infected with delta and omicron variants. Results Both variants caused acute inflammation and lung pathology in intranasally infected hamsters. Principal component analysis uncovered the delta variant significantly altered lung metabolite levels between the pre- and post-infection states. Additionally, metabolic pathways determined by assessment of metabolites and genes in lung revealed significant alterations in arginine biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism upon infection with both variants and closely linked to inflammatory cytokines, indicating immune activation and oxidative stress in response to both variants. These metabolic changes were also evident in the serum, validating the presence of systemic alterations corresponding to those identified in lung. Notably, the delta variant induced a more robust metabolic regulation than the omicron variant. Discussion The study suggests that multi-omics is a valuable approach for understanding immunometabolic responses to infectious diseases, and providing insights for effective treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to over 670 million infections and nearly 7 million deaths worldwide. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has precipitated a significant public health crisis. The prevalence of liver function abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 53% among healthy individuals or patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and shows a positive correlation with disease severity; moreover, specific adaptive immune responses can influence the trajectory and outcomes of COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 may impact autoimmunity through mechanisms such as excessive stimulation of immune responses and molecular mimicry, particularly in genetically predisposed individuals. Currently, the overall mutational trend of SARS-CoV-2 indicates heightened infectivity and immune evasion capabilities. Consequently, vaccination remains crucial for universal protection against this disease. Nevertheless, alongside the widespread implementation of vaccination programs globally, an increasing number of cases have been documented where COVID-19 vaccination appears to trigger new-onset autoimmune hepatitis; yet definitive evidence is still pending elucidation regarding causality. In this review, we analyse the clinical-immunological characteristics, risks associated with severe disease progression, and prognosis for AIH patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; discuss the detrimental effects exerted by SARS-CoV-2 on hepatic function; summarise the mechanisms and attributes leading to new-onset AIH; as well as provide insights into how vaccination may interfere with autoimmunity processes. We continue to underscore the significance of vaccination while aiming to enhance awareness concerning potential risks associated with it—this could facilitate better management strategies for autoimmune diseases along with appropriate adjustments in vaccination protocols. Although the precise triggering mechanism linking COVID-19-related events to AIH remains unclear, existing evidence suggests that this relationship is far from coincidental.">

While advancement of vaccines and drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 virus has reduced severe illness, reinfection remains a significant concern. This paper explores the impact of COVID-19 reinfection on human immunity and examines possible coping strategies, particularly the advancements in plant-derived adjuvants to enhance vaccine efficacy. The virus's ability to mutate, evade immune responses, and affect immune memory highlights the importance and potential effectiveness of treatments that prolong immunity response. Plant-derived adjuvants Advax and Matrix-M have been shown to improve long term immune responses by stimulating long-lasting antibodies and cytotoxic T-cell activation. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy and safety in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19, along plant-based adjuvants reducing reinfection risks. Future research could further focus on develop precising adjuvants’ formulations, exploring more plant-based compounds that could be apply in vaccine development, and conducting long-term studies to evaluate long-term immune durability and safety of the vaccines.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to numerous cases of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), worldwide. This co-infection has increased patient mortality due to the lack of efficient bi-targeted drugs. Cambogin, a bioactive natural product, has been shown to effectively induce regression of KSHV-latently infected tumours in xenograft mice models; however, its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Here, we report that Cambogin targets 46 host genes commonly affected by both SARS-CoV-2 and KSHV infections, as identified through bioinformatics analysis. These genes are related with 14 key upstream signalling pathways, particularly those involved in inflammation regulation, protein phosphorylation, metabolic processes, and cellular stress response. Within the transcriptional factor (TF)-miRNA co-regulatory network, ten out of 46 hub-target genes are closely linked to Cambogin and KSHV/SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, Cambogin not only efficiently blocks the replication and virion production of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo by reducing the expression of EGFR and Cyclin A2, but also simultaneously inhibits both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the growth of KSHV-induced tumours in vivo using a murine xenograft model. These findings provide an alternative strategy for the potential use of Cambogin in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients, particularly those with KSHV co-infection.">

This review investigates the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2's interaction with cardiac tissue, particularly emphasizing the role of the Spike protein and ACE2 receptor in facilitating viral entry and subsequent cardiac complications. We dissect the structural features of the virus, its interactions with host cell receptors, and the resulting pathophysiological changes in the heart. Highlighting SARS-CoV-2's broad organ tropism, especially its effects on cardiomyocytes via ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the review addresses how these interactions exacerbate cardiovascular issues in patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Additionally, we assess both direct and indirect mechanisms of virus-induced cardiac damage, including myocarditis, arrhythmias, and long-term complications such as 'long COVID'. This review underscores the complexity of SARS-CoV-2's impact on the heart, emphasizing the need for ongoing research to fully understand its long-term effects on cardiovascular health.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with significant cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infection and pulmonary embolism. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the myocardium of the left ventricle and the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in deceased COVID-19 patients. We conducted a post-mortem examination on 91 individuals who succumbed to COVID-19-related complications. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the myocardium of the left ventricle was analyzed reverse transcription real time PCR (RT-qPCR) (EliGene® COVID19 UKV/SAV RT kit, Elisabeth Pharmacon), and antibody levels in serum were analyzed by serological assays (VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgM and VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgG II tests, BioMérieux). Of the heart tissue samples, 44 % tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our findings indicate that any detectable level of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 reduces the risk of viral penetration into the myocardium by more than fourfold. Specifically, individuals with detectable levels of IgG and IgM antibodies exhibited a significantly reduced presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiac tissues (p<0.0001 for IgG and p<0.001 for IgM). Notably, all patients who died from pulmonary embolism had elevated levels of IgG antibodies. The study underscores the protective role of IgG and IgM antibodies in preventing SARS-CoV-2 penetration into cardiac tissues. However, high antibody titers were associated with fatal outcomes such as pulmonary embolism, pointing to the intricate balance of immune response in COVID-19 pathology.

        <tr id="Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Several respiratory viruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‐Coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), suppress nuclear factor‐E2‐related factor‐2 (NRF2) antioxidant response, generating oxidative stress conditions to its advantage. NRF2 has also been reported to regulate the innate immune response through the inhibition of the interferon (IFN) pathway. However, its modulation in younger individuals and its correlation with the IFN response remain to be elucidated. Methods The NRF2 and redox‐related genes expression was examined in nasopharyngeal swabs from children attending the pediatric hospital for SARS‐CoV‐2 molecular testing. Expression levels were analyzed by stratifying the population according to the SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity, age, or the presence of symptoms. The results were correlated with Types I and III IFN genes and IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs). Results We found that NRF2 expression was markedly diminished in positive patients compared to negative. Moreover, it correlated with higher expression of IFNα2 and IFNλ3, as well as ISG15 and ISG56. Interestingly, symptomatic patients with anosmia/ageusia showed pronounced expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease1/redox factor 1 (APE1), together with Type I IFNs, ISG56, and the inflammasome component NLRP3. Conclusion The results indicate an interdependence between NRF2 antioxidant pathway and IFN‐mediated response during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in young subjects.">

        <tr id="Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer, known for its immune evasion and resistance to chemotherapy. Evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may worsen outcomes for RCC patients, as well as patients with diminished renal function. Evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may exacerbate outcomes in RCC patients and those with impaired renal function. This study explored the unidirectional effects of RCC cells and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) on human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) using a microphysiological approach. We co-cultured RCC cells (Caki-1) with RPTEC and exposed them to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein under dynamic 3D conditions. The impact on metabolic activity, gene expression, immune secretions, and S protein internalization was evaluated. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein was internalized by RPTEC but poorly interacted with RCC cells. RPTECs exposed to RCC cells and the S protein exhibited upregulated expression of genes involved in immunogenic pathways, particularly those related to antigen processing and presentation via the major histocompatibility complex I (MHCI). Additionally, increased TNF-α secretion suggested a pro-inflammatory response. Metabolic shifts toward glycolysis were observed in RCC co-culture, while the presence of the S protein led to minor changes. The presence of RCC cells amplified the immune-modulatory effects of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein on the renal epithelium, potentially exacerbating renal inflammation and fostering tumor-supportive conditions. These findings suggest that COVID-19 infections can impact renal function in the presence of kidney cancer.">

        <tr id="Understanding the early interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human airway epithelial cells is essential for unraveling viral replication and spread mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the early dynamics of airway epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection using well-differentiated human nasal and tracheal epithelial cell cultures by incorporating three publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We identified a previously uncharacterized cell population, termed virus-rich intermediate (VRI) cells, representing an intermediate differentiation stage between basal and ciliated cells. These VRI cells exhibited high viral loads at all infection time points, strong interferon and inflammatory responses, increased mRNA expression of microvilli-related genes (PAK1, PAK4, VIL1), and suppression of apoptosis markers (BAX, CASP3) alongside increased anti-apoptotic gene expression (BCL2). Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that VRI cells send signals to basal cells via receptor-ligand pathways such as EPHA and VEGF, likely promoting basal cell differentiation and proliferation through MAPK signaling. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes VRI cells as a primary site for replication and spread, leveraging these cells’ unique differentiation state to evade host cell death and facilitate viral propagation. This study provides insights into the early cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights potential therapeutic targets to limit viral spread.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the worst pandemics in human history. The causative virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can invade host cells in multiple organs by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II expressed on the cell surface. Once inside the host cell, viral replication takes place, leading to cellular disruption and the release of signal molecules that are recognised by the innate immune system. Innate immunity activation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and primes the adaptive immune system. The proinflammatory environment defends against further viral entry and replication. SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to lead to myocardial injury through several mechanisms. Firstly, direct viral-mediated cellular invasion of cardiomyocytes has been shown in in vitro and histological studies, which is related to cellular injury. Secondly, the proinflammatory state during COVID-19 can lead to myocardial injury and the release of protein remnants of the cardiac contractile machinery. Thirdly, the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is associated with thromboembolism of coronary arteries and/or other vascular systems. COVID-19 patients can also develop heart failure; however, the underlying mechanism is much less well-characterised than for myocardial injury. Several questions remain regarding COVID-19-related heart failure, including its potential reversibility, the role of anti-viral medications in its prevention, and the mechanisms underlying heart failure pathogenesis in long COVID-19. Further work is required to improve our understanding of the mechanism of cardiac sequelae in COVID-19, which may enable us to target SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients against longer-lasting cardiovascular complications.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are critical human pathogens that continually expand to naïve populations and for which there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the respiratory system and other organ systems. Tissue injuries resulting from viral infection and host hyperinflammatory responses may lead to moderate to severe pneumonia, systemic complications, and even death. While anti-inflammatory agents have been used to treat patients with severe COVID-19, their therapeutic effects are limited. GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) is a pro-inflammatory receptor expressed on vascular endothelial cells, regulating leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a GPR4 antagonist, NE-52-QQ57, in the SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Our results demonstrated that GPR4 antagonist treatment increased the survival rate in this severe COVID-19 mouse model. The inflammatory response, characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was reduced in the GPR4 antagonist group compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, both SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and infectious viral titers in the mouse lung were decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive mouse brains was also decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, the GPR4 antagonist inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero E6 cells. Together, these results suggest that GPR4 antagonism may be explored as a novel approach for the treatment of COVID-19 and other similar viral diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis is a rare but serious complication of COVID-19. The host response correlates of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis remain unclear, thereby limiting therapeutic development. We therefore performed proteomic and transcriptomic phenotyping of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis in Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries. We included a bioenergetics focus given the emerging role of mitochondrial function in enteroviral myocarditis. Early (<30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). Values are log10 transformed, and p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons across the full twenty biomarkers (six shown here; * indicates a p-value < 0.05). CRP = C-Reactive Protein; IFNG = Interferon Gamma ; PCT= Procalcitonin; TNFR1 = Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1; DDIMER = D-dimer; and IL1RA = Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Methods We previously adjudicated five unvaccinated pre-Delta SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis cases among 5265 MHS beneficiaries who enrolled into the EPICC study with COVID-19; four of these cases had blood collected. We matched myocarditis cases 1:10 with sex, age, comorbidity, and blood sampling-time matched controls (SARS-CoV-2 infection with no myocarditis) from the EPICC study. Cases and controls underwent comparison of early (< 30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay (with multiplicity adjustment). We also performed early whole blood transcriptomic sequencing with DESeq2 and GSEA analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways, including mitochondrial (mtDNA) regulated innate immune pathways (with FDR for multiple comparisons). Gene set enrichment analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). FDR = False Discovery Rate; NES = Normalized enrichment score. Results We detected higher post-infection Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (TNFR1) and procalcitonin (PCT) plasma concentrations in myocarditis cases versus matched controls (TNFR1: 0.33 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.032; PCT: 0.59 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.02) (Fig 1). We noted no statistically significant difference in the 18 other proteomic markers tested. GSEA analysis noted upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS pathway genes, and downregulated mtDNA innate immune genes, in cases versus controls (FDR < 0.05) (Fig 2). Conclusion In this MHS study, SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis was associated with elevation of TNFR1 and PCT secretion, upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS gene expression, and downregulated mtDNA innate immunity. While constrained by small sample sizes of a rare complication, these biomarker associations prompt mechanistic studies which may direct development of therapies for myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other respiratory viral pathogens.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has profoundly impacted global health, with pneumonia emerging as a major complication in severe cases. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is marked by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an excessive inflammatory response, resulting in oxidative stress and significant tissue damage, particularly in the respiratory system. Antioxidants have garnered considerable attention for their potential role in managing COVID-19 pneumonia by mitigating oxidative stress and modulating immune responses. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the use of antioxidants in hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Studies exploring antioxidants, including vitamins, trace elements, nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O3), glutathione (GSH), L-carnitine, melatonin, bromelain, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and numerous polyphenols, have yielded promising outcomes. Through their ROS-scavenging properties, these molecules support endothelial function, reduce the thrombosis risk, and may help mitigate the effects of the cytokine storm, a key contributor to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Clinical evidence suggests that antioxidant supplementation may improve patient outcomes by decreasing inflammation, supporting immune cell function, and potentially shortening recovery times. Furthermore, these molecules may mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19 by exerting direct antiviral effects that inhibit the infection process and genomic replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. Moreover, antioxidants may work synergistically with standard antiviral treatments to reduce viral-induced oxidative damage. By integrating findings from the literature with real-world data from our clinical experience, we gain a more profound understanding of the role of antioxidants in managing COVID-19 pneumonia. Further research combining comprehensive literature reviews with real-world data analysis is crucial to validate the efficacy of antioxidants and establish evidence-based guidelines for their use in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2s) have recently been shown to exert key regulatory functions in innate and adaptive immune response networks that drive the establishment and progression of type 2 immunity and its associated pathologies. Although mainly tissue resident, ILC2s and their crosstalk within tissue microenvironments influences both local and systemic metabolism. In turn, the metabolic status shapes the diverse ILC2 phenotypes and effector functions. Hence, deciphering the metabolic networks of ILC2s is essential in understanding ILC2’s roles in health as well as pathophysiologies. Here we detail a framework of experimental approaches to study key immunometabolic states of primary murine ILC2s and link them to phenotypes and functionality. Utilizing flow cytometry, Single Cell ENergetIc metabolism by ProfilIng Translation inhibition (SCENITH) as well as the Seahorse platform we provide a framework that allows in-depth analysis of cellular bioenergetic states to determine the immunometabolic wiring of ILC2.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Coronaviruses are endemic in the human population and include both seasonal viruses as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), with exposure history differing between children and adults. We sought to identify age-specific differences in memory CD4 T cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), as quantitative and qualitative differences in immune function may be responsible for age-related variation in disease presentation. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from cohorts of children and adults enrolled pre-2019 and following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Subjects enrolled post-pandemic had a history of COVID-19 vaccination. Cells were stimulated with peptide pools representing the unique and more cross-reactive portions of the S protein for 24 hours, with cytokine release blocked for the last 4 hours of coculture. Subsets of S-specific CD4 T cells were identified using a 31-plex spectral flow cytometry panel. Results Pre-pandemic, adults had a higher frequency of activated IFNγ+ CD4 T cells specific for the S protein compared to children, with boosting of responses in both adults and children following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, the CD4 T cell response to the S protein was Th1 biased, with adults having a greater proportion of cells expressing IFNγ, IL2 and TNFα. When cytokine-expressing, antigen-specific CD4 T cells were subsetted by CD45RA and CCR7 expression, there was a more naïve phenotype pre-pandemic, with transition to an effector memory phenotype post-2019. Conclusion A greater magnitude of CD4 T cells specific for the S protein was detected in adults pre-pandemic, with this reactivity boosted in both children and adults following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Boosting of reactivity to both unique and conserved S protein epitopes in children and adults suggested that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via vaccination did not preferentially boost memory CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes. Post-pandemic, there was a shift to a more Th1 phenotype together with a gain in cytokine-producing CD4 T cells with a phenotype consistent with effector memory. Disclosures Jennifer L.

 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a dynamic evolution of the immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), initially characterized by primary responses and later by secondary responses due to mass vaccination and viral variants. Understanding the interplay between humoral (antibody) and cellular (T-cell) immunity is crucial for effective public health strategies. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between T-cell responses and antibody levels in a sample of the adult Albanian population during the transition of COVID-19 from a pandemic to an endemic phase. The rationale for this investigation is to generate data that can inform the ongoing management of COVID-19, particularly in the context of vaccination and immunity monitoring, to ensure that public health strategies remain effective as the virus becomes more permanent in the population.



 This cross-sectional observational study involved individuals over 18 years of age who were randomly selected at intervals of every 20 records from the family doctor registries of five urban health centers in Tirana and Berat, Albania, between January 23 and April 3, 2023. Participants provided demographic and health data, including vaccination and infection history. Blood samples were analyzed for cellular immunity using an Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assay and for humoral immunity using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure anti-spike (S1) and anti-nucleoprotein (N) IgG antibodies. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between levels of IFN-γ, anti-S1, and anti-N IgG antibodies and factors such as vaccination status, prior COVID-19 infections, and reinfection rates. These analyses employed bivariate and multivariate approaches, including Fisher’s exact test, the Mann–Whitney U test, the Kruskal–Wallis test, linear and multiple regression analyses, and Spearman’s correlation coefficient test.



 The study involved 164 individuals (54.7% female, median age 43 years). Of these individuals, 62.8% (103/164) were vaccinated, primarily with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. IFN-γ positivity was detected in 95.1% (156/164), and anti-S1 IgG positivity in 93.3% (153/164). Significant correlations were observed between IFN-γ and anti-S1 IgG levels (r = 0.502; P < 0.001). Vaccinated individuals exhibited significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and anti-S1 IgG than unvaccinated individuals (P < 0.05). Reinfections were more prevalent in unvaccinated individuals than vaccinated individuals (26.2% [16/61] vs. 12.6% [13/103], P = 0.034). According to multiple regression analysis, the levels of anti-S1 antibodies were significantly correlated with protection against reinfection (regression coefficient β = –0.003; P = 0.042), while IFN-γ levels did not exhibit such a correlation (regression coefficient β = –1.659; P = 0.146).



 Vaccination, especially when combined with previous infection, significantly boosts both cellular and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The close correlation between IFN-γ and anti-S1 IgG levels indicates that vaccinated individuals mount a robust immune response. The lower reinfection rates among vaccinated individuals highlight the importance of vaccination for sustained protection. Assessing anti-S1 IgG antibodies and IFN-γ levels could be particularly beneficial for immunocompromised individuals when making decisions about revaccination. This study highlights the critical role of comprehensive immune monitoring in the management of COVID-19 and offers insights for future vaccination strategies.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and -2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) that have caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, a better understanding of host responses to β-CoVs would provide insights into the pathogenesis of these viruses to identify potential targets for medical countermeasures. In this study, our objective is to use a systems biology approach to explore the magnitude and scope of innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection over time in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3/2B4 cells). Total RNA extracted at 12, 24, and 48 hours after β-CoVs or mock infection of Calu-3/2B4 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis to select genes whose expressions were significantly modulated post-infection. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 stimulate similar yet distinct innate antiviral signaling pathways in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that many genes related to the viral life cycle, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated at multiple time points. Based on their profound modulation upon infection by SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron BA.1, four ISGs, i.e., bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 11 (CXCL11), and Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1), were identified as potential drug targets against β-CoVs. Our findings suggest that these genes affect both pathogens directly and indirectly through the innate immune response, making them potential targets for host-directed antivirals. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induce differential effects on host innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with neurological effects that persist beyond the acute phase, collectively referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or “long COVID.” This article discusses the neurological impacts of PASC, which can occur regardless of the initial illness’s severity. Studies indicate that most patients continue to experience symptoms for at least 3 months post-infection. Long-term effects include neurocognitive deficits, sleep disturbances, and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. Proposed mechanisms underlying these effects include neuroinflammation, microvascular damage, and autoimmune responses, while direct viral neuroinvasion remains a topic of ongoing debate. SARS-CoV-2 may also worsen pre-existing neurological disorders and increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease. The article highlights the need for longitudinal studies to better understand the variability in outcomes and the mechanisms driving these persistent effects. In addition, it explores the inflammatory pathways linking long COVID to AD. Both conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation, activation of shared markers such as the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome, and alterations in amyloid-beta production. The apolipoprotein E4 gene, a known risk factor for AD, is also associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. Neuroimaging studies reveal brain changes in COVID-19 survivors, particularly in regions related to cognition and memory, further emphasizing the need for long-term research to assess the potential role of long COVID in exacerbating neurodegenerative diseases.">

 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. However, SARS-CoV-2 chiefly infects lungs through the binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) expressed on the alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, the intestinal epithelial cells also express ACE2 receptors. Not only has the SARS-CoV-2 been detected in nasopharyngeal and mid-nasal samples, but also it seems SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found in the feces of infectious patients. In fact, fecal samples of patients contain RNA of the virus. The intensity of COVID-19 has mainly been associated with aging and comorbidities. Older patients experience a decline in the alteration of the gut microbiome, and COVID-19 has proven to be most fatal in this age group, further emphasizing the potential critical role of gut microbiota in this disease. The lung was formerly believed to be a sterile area free from bacteria. However, the lung microbiome has received more attention due to its recent link to several respiratory illnesses and immunity. In this review article, data from COVID-19 research and gut–lung cross-talk in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease and explored the bidirectional impacts of it on the gut–lung axis microbiome were discussed.

        <tr id="We have previously shown that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1E2 envelope glycoprotein can regulate HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) activity through disruption to NF-κB activation. This response is associated with upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S, M, and E but not the N structural protein can perform similar downmodulation of HIV-1 LTR activation, and in a dose-dependent manner, in both HEK293 and lung BEAS-2B cell lines. This effect is highest with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S strain and decreases over time for the subsequent emerging variants of concern (VOC), with Omicron providing the weakest effect. We developed pseudo-typed viral particle (PVP) viral tools that allowed for the generation of cell lines constitutively expressing the four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and utilising the VSV-g envelope protein to deliver the integrated gene construct. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed on cells expressing S, E, M, or N to determine cell activation status. Gene expression differences were found in a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IF16, IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15, as well as for a number of heat shock protein (HSP) genes, including HSPH1, HSPA6, and HSPBP1, with all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. There were also differences observed in expression patterns of transcription factors, with both SP1 and MAVS upregulated in the presence of S, M, and E but not the N protein. Collectively, the results indicate that gene expression patterns associated with ER stress pathways can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein expression. The results suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate an array of cell pathways, resulting in disruption to NF-κB signalling, hence providing alterations to multiple physiological responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.">

        <tr id="Diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) represent two public health emergencies. In severe disease, both pathogens may share a biological niche in the lower respiratory tract. There is significant potential for SARS-CoV-2 and M.tb infections to be co-present within individuals and enhance or moderate the respective outcomes of either infection. Here, we investigated how whole blood samples, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, from individuals hospitalised with acute COVID-19 disease respond to mycobacterial challenge. To do this, samples were assessed by ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assays, immune cell phenotyping by mass cytometry, and whole blood cytokine responses to mycobacterial antigens assessed by flow cytometry. These studies identified a subgroup of COVID-19 patients whose blood had an enhanced capacity to inhibit mycobacterial growth. The ability to control mycobacterial growth was associated with the presence of a non M.tb-specific CD28+ CD8+ T cell population, with a particular activation status and migratory phenotype. This work improves our understanding of factors involved in mycobacterial control, and may contribute to the design of novel therapies for TB.">

        <tr id="Introduction Multiple myeloma (MM) is an uncontrolled plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow, leading to immune dysregulation with impaired humoral immune responses. Conversely, cellular-based responses play a vital role in MM patients. However, the extent and duration of cellular-induced protection remain unclear to date. Here, immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) like Lenalidomide (Lena) become interesting, as they may have stimulatory effects on T-cell functioning. Methods In this study we investigated immune responses elicited by COVID-19 vaccine or infection comparing 43 healthy volunteers (avg. 35y, 72.1% female, 81.4% previously COVID-19 infected), with 41 MM patients under Lena maintenance therapy (avg. 63.8y, 51.2% female, 61% previously COVID-19 infected). Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), spike-RBD, and nucleocapsid (N) were measured via ELISA in subjects’ plasma. Freshly isolated PBMCs, incubated with SARS-CoV-2 peptides (N, S), activation induced marker (AIM) assays and flow cytometry, allowed us to assess cellular responses (CD8+ T, T(F)H: CD4+ T (follicular) helper). Results Whereas healthy controls showed significant better humoral responses (N IgA p<0.001), T cell responses were robust in the MM group (higher S-act. TH, p<0.001). Stratified by COVID-19 status, the MM group showed higher N-act. TH (p=0.03). These results were unchanged comparing a Lena intake with Lena break around vaccination. Discussion Taken together, MM patients under Lena therapy exhibit weakened antibody production but present a robust T cell response following SARS-COV-2 infection or vaccination. Our results highlight the importance of vaccination in this subgroup and moreover, argue against a Lena intake break around the time of vaccination.">

        <tr id="Although emerging data have revealed the critical role of memory CD8+ T cells in preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and its memory and innate-like subsets in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with various disease manifestations in an HLA-restricted fashion remain to be understood. Here, we show the strong association of protective cellular immunity with mild COVID-19 and unique cell types against SARS-CoV-2 virus in an HLA-A2 restricted manner. ELISpot assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in mild COVID-19 patients are significantly higher than in severe patients, whereas neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 virus significantly correlate with disease severity. Single-cell analyses of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells, which recognize highly conserved immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes, demonstrate divergent profiles in unvaccinated patients with mild versus severe disease. CD8+ T-cell types including cytotoxic KLRB1+ CD8αα cells with innate-like T-cell signatures, IFNGhiID3hi memory cells and IL7R+ proliferative stem cell-like memory cells are preferentially observed in mild COVID-19, whereas distinct terminally-differentiated T-cell subsets are predominantly detected in severe COVID-19: highly activated FASLhi T-cell subsets and early-terminated or dysfunctional IL4R+ GATA3+ stem cell-like memory T-cell subset. In conclusion, our findings suggest that unique and contrasting SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell profiles may dictate COVID-19 severity. Graphical abstract.

        <tr id="Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus persists in multiple organs due to its tropism for various tissues, including the skeletal system. This study investigates the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including both ancestral and Omicron viral strains, on differentiating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the precursor cells, into osteoblasts. Although both viral strains can productively infect osteoblasts, precursor cell infection remained abortive. Viral exposure during osteoblast differentiation demonstrates that both variants inhibit mineral and organic matrix deposition. This is accompanied by reduced expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the upregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) strongly suggests that the ancestral and Omicron variants may disrupt bone homeostasis by promoting osteoclast differentiation, ultimately leading to the formation of bone-resorbing cells. This process is dependent of spike glycoprotein since its neutralization significantly reduced the effect of infective SARS-CoV-2 and UV-C inactivated virus. This study underscores the capacity of ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants to disrupt osteoblast differentiation, a process essential for preserving the homeostasis and functionality of bone tissue.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has challenged the scientific and medical community since its emergence. Understanding the immunopathogenic events that occur during infection is crucial to developing effective treatment and prevention strategies.Objective: To synthesize the immunological aspects in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019.Development: SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the entry of the virus into host cells through the ACE2 receptor. Once inside, the virus induces an immune response. In the early stages, the innate immune response is activated, which includes the release of interferons and cytokines. However, in some patients, this response becomes deregulated, triggering a cytokine storm that contributes to systemic inflammation and lung damage. T and B cells also play a crucial role; although the activation of CD8+ T cells can help control the infection, their depletion in severe cases has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Immunopathogenic events in COVID-19 are complex and can lead to diverse clinical outcomes. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for the development of targeted therapies and effective vaccines. Continued research is critical to improving our response to future pandemics.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The global pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 has resulted in millions of people experiencing long COVID condition, a range of persistent symptoms following the acute phase, with an estimated prevalence of 27%–64%. Materials and Methods To understand its pathophysiology, we conducted a longitudinal study on viral load and cytokine dynamics in individuals with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We used reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR to quantify viral RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and employed multiplex technology to measure plasma cytokine levels in a cohort of people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Our study included individuals with long COVID condition and those without, all of whom had at least three nasopharyngeal and plasma samples collected within 55 days after diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results Individuals affected with long COVID symptoms had delayed viral clearance and lower viral loads at diagnosis compared to those without symptoms. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed variations in IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10 levels, with delayed normalization in individuals affected by long COVID syndrome. Correlation analysis indicated associations between viral load and IP‐10 and interrelations among cytokines IL‐1β, IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10. Conclusion Our study provides insights into the association between nasopharyngeal viral load, cytokine dynamics, and the development of long COVID syndrome, providing an early signature of this condition.">

Methods To this end, blood samples from a cohort of 304 food and retail workers from the Quebec City region were collected during three visits at 12-week intervals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils were isolated during the first and third visits and were stimulated with R848 to assess the innate immune response. Results Our results show that IL-8 production after stimulation decreased after vaccination. In addition, the IL-8 response was significantly different depending on the season when the visit occurred, for both COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.

The regeneration of myelin, or remyelination, occurs spontaneously following demyelination. The lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced focal demyelination model enables investigations into the mechanisms of remyelination, providing insight into the molecular basis underlying an evolving remyelinating microenvironment over a tractable time course. Here, we present a detailed analysis using high-resolution single nucleus RNA sequencing to investigate gene expression dynamics across multiple cell populations involved in the remyelination process. We examine three specific time points following focal demyelinating injury in mice, and by delineating activation states within the heterogeneous cell populations of demyelinated lesions, we highlight changes in gene expression within subclusters of each cell population from the early stages of injury response to the initiation and maintenance of remyelination. Our findings reveal how shifts in microglial, astrocytic and fibroblast activities within lesions are associated with efficient oligodendrocyte differentiation during remyelination.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 are still active in the population. Some patients remained PCR-positive for more than 4 weeks, called “persistently PCR-positive”. Recent evidence suggests a link between the gut microbiota and susceptibility to COVID-19, although no studies have explored persistent PCR conditions. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between persistent positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, the gut microbiome, and individual host determinants. Methods A shotgun metagenomic analysis was conducted on fecal samples from 28 individuals affected by COVID-19. Patients were divided into two groups: those who had cleared the virus within 30 days (designated as the control group) (n = 15), and those who remained PCR-positive beyond 30 days (called the PCR+ group) (n = 13). We also investigated the correlation between prolonged viral clearance and several additional factors, including clinical parameters, immune responses, microbial metabolites, and dietary habits. Results The composition and functionality of the microbiome varied based on the duration of positivity as determined by PCR. Compared to the control group, the persistent PCR+ group exhibited elevated pathogen levels and augmented diversity in functional gene families (p-value < 0.05). A multi-omics analysis integrating metagenomics, metabolites, and metadata also revealed the specific contribution of certain blood markers in this group, including basophils, IgM, IgG (both general and specific for SARS-CoV-2), and markers of liver damage. Unhealthy diet was identified as a significant factor influencing the duration of PCR positivity. Conclusions These findings indicate that the gut microbiome may play a role in delayed viral clearance and persistent positive RT-PCR results. Our study also contributes to the understanding of the role of host factors as mediators linking the gut microbiota and disease outcomes. Further large-scale studies must confirm these data; however, they suggest the relevance of monitoring microbiome changes in the early post-viral years to control SARS-CoV-2 and providing individual healthcare support.">

        <tr id="Introduction. In present, the medical community continues to study the impact of coronavirus infection on various organs and systems of the body. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes multifaceted pathological processes and, among other things, affects the cells of the circulatory system. Objective: To assess the degree of DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Material and methods. 200 patients took part in the study. The control group consisted of conditionally healthy individuals matched by gender and age (n=50). The degree of DNA damage was assessed using the DNA comet assay in an alkaline medium. The assessment parameters included: tail length (TL) (pc), percentage of damaged DNA in the tail (Tail DNA, %), tail moment (conventional units) and Olive moment (conventional units). Results. The average values of the parameters of comet DNA of patients in the acute period of coronavirus infection were: TL 95.18±5.7 pc, percentage of damaged DNA in the tail (Tail DNA%) 70.82±7.12%, tail moment 68.52±8.58 conventional units, Olive moment 41.11±4.46 conventional units. When comparing the parameters of comet DNA of lymphocytes of conditionally healthy individuals and patients in the acute period of coronavirus infection associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a significant increase (p < 0.001) in these parameters is noted, which indicates an increase in the content of fragmented and damaged DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes in sick individuals. Conclusion. The obtained results prove the powerful genotoxic effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on human cells">

        <tr id="In the past decade, a major goal in biomedical research has been to understand why individuals differ in disease susceptibility, disease dynamics, and progression. In many pathologies, this variability stems from evolved immune mechanisms that resist inflammatory stress from various diseases that have been encountered throughout life. These may provide advantages against other diseases, reduce comorbidities, and enhance longevity. This study evaluates prior immunity as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, crucial for understanding plasmatic signaling cascades in different disease stages and their impact on disease progression. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, primarily affects the respiratory system and presents a wide range of symptoms, posing significant challenges to medicine. This study systematically analyzed prior immunity and inflammation in two independent cohorts of infected patients. A serological profile is determined by protein microarrays, which identify IgM and IgG responses against 37 prevalent microbial pathogens and provide a comprehensive plasma analysis of 21 acute-phase proteins. Our results reveal distinct serological profiles correlating with disease severity, indicating that immune system dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is linked to existing immunity. These findings highlight the relevance of prior immunity for monitoring disease progression, particularly in infections and vaccine failure, and underscore the importance of functional proteomics in determining prognostic biomarkers.">

Neurological symptoms include anxiety, depression and impaired short-term memory. However, the exact underlying mechanisms of long Covid are not yet decrypted. Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid. Conclusively, we provide evidence that virus-related and neurodegenerative and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of infected hamsters and contribute to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells are associated with viral clearance and improved outcomes in COVID-19, but also with immunopathology. Defining T cell diversity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables implementation of T cells in prevention and treatment strategies. T cells recognize peptide sequences from pathogens upon presentation in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Human MHC molecule diversity results in a wide array of peptide recognition by T cells making viral escape difficult, but also challenging to measure. Methods Using the ImmunoSEQ Assay to sequence complementarity-determining regions in the β chains (CDR3β) of the T cell receptor (TCR) from peripheral blood collected from participants in the EPICC COVID-19 cohort study, we quantified and characterized patterns of TCR usage. Multiple bioinformatic pipelines were compared for analysis. Results Our study evaluated TCR repertoires from 39 participants who had mild (20 outpatient) versus severe (19 hospitalized) acute COVID-19, and either experienced unvaccinated primary infection (n = 15) or vaccine breakthrough infection (n = 24) (Table 1). From these four clinical groups, we used the ImmuneCODE database, VDJdatabase and healthy controls to identify CD8 TCR sequences and amino acid motifs in the CDR3β region specific for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We were surprised to find that vaccine breakthrough and primary infection participants exhibited similar frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR sequences over 14-21 days post-symptom onset. Increased use of common TCR clones occurred in participants with older age and comorbidities, which correlated with more severe disease (Figure 1). Strikingly, an increased frequency of non-SARS-CoV-2 TCRs was significantly associated with severe disease in unvaccinated (p = 0.006) and vaccinated participants (p = 0.045). Conclusion In conclusion, our study highlights the opportunities and challenges of studying the complexity of T cell diversity and the utility of combining databases and bioinformatics for identification of patterns of TCR recognition. Interestingly, participants who were hospitalized were more likely to have circulating T cells non-specific for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that vaccines that increase T cell specificity may reduce disease severity.

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly impacted global health, emphasizing the need to understand its pathogenicity and virulence mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the alveolar epithelial barrier and exacerbates airway inflammation, leading to acute respiratory failure, but the molecular details remain unclear. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurological symptoms, potentially due to its weakly understood ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The viral multifunctional Envelope (E) protein is crucial for its virulence, playing a key role in virus assembly, budding, and release. The E protein contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) that interacts with host PDZ domain-containing proteins, potentially affecting host signaling pathways and contributing to pathogenicity. This study focuses on the E protein PBM and its role in virulence, disrupting respiratory epithelial barriers and exacerbating airway inflammation. We generated recombinant mutant viruses lacking the PBM and conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments to elucidate its impact on viral fitness, pathogenicity, and effects on the epithelial integrity. In vitro, the viral mutants showed delayed replication and reduced cytopathic effects. In vivo, experiments with hamsters revealed that PBM-deficient viruses caused less weight loss, lower viral loads, and reduced inflammation, indicating decreased pathogenicity. Histological analyses confirmed less airway damage in these hamsters compared to those infected with the wild-type virus. Additionally, PBM-deficient viruses had impaired interactions with tight junction proteins like ZO-1, a PDZ-containing protein, crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Our findings also demonstrate that the PBM does not play a significant role in neuroinvasion during the acute phase of infection, as evidenced by comparable viral RNA loads across brain regions in infected hamsters, regardless of PBM presence. Histopathological and transcriptomic analyses further support this observation, suggesting that the PBM primarily affects specific epithelial barriers. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis on lung and brainstem from infected hamsters reveals that the PBM modulates inflammatory and immune responses, with a stronger impact in lung tissue than in the brainstem. PBM-deficient viruses induce lower levels of inflammation and cytokine expression, suggesting PBM’s specific role in enhancing viral pathogenicity through the activation of pathways such as NF-κB and TNF. Thus, the E protein PBM plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2’s fitness, virulence, and pathogenicity, through the disruption of cell junctions and inflammation, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Introduction Upon infection, T cell-driven B cell responses in GC reactions induce memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells that secrete protective antibodies. How formation of specifically long-lived plasma cells is regulated via the interplay between specific B and CD4+ T cells is not well understood. Generally, antibody levels decline over time after clearance of the primary infection. Method In this study, convalescent individuals with stable RBD antibody levels (n=14, “sustainers”) were compared with donors (n=13) with the greatest antibody decline from a cohort of 132. To investigate the role of the cellular immune compartment in the maintenance of antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific responses at 4 to 6 weeks post-mild COVID-19 infection were characterized using deep immune profiling. Results Both groups had similar frequencies of total SARS-CoV-2-specific B and CD4+ T cells. Sustainers had fewer Spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells early after infection and increased neutralizing capacity of RBD antibodies over time, unlike the declining group. However, declining IgG titers correlated with lower frequency of Spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Conclusion These data suggest that “sustainers” have unique dynamics of GC reactions, yield different outputs of terminally differentiating cells, and improve the quality of protective antibodies over time. This study helps identify factors controlling formation of long-lived PC and sustained antibody responses.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly impacted global health, affecting not only the immediate morbidity and mortality rates but also long-term health outcomes across various populations. Although the acute effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system have initially been the primary focus, it is increasingly evident that the virus can have significant impacts on multiple physiological systems, including the nervous and immune systems. The pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between viral infection, immune aging, and brain health, that can potentially accelerate neuroimmune aging and contribute to the persistence of long COVID conditions. By inducing chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and neuroinflammation, COVID-19 may exacerbate the processes of neuroimmune aging, leading to increased risks of cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases, and impaired immune function. Key factors include chronic immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the disruption of cellular processes. These overlapping mechanisms between aging and COVID-19 illustrate how the virus can induce and accelerate aging-related processes, leading to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases and other age-related conditions. This mini-review examines key features and possible mechanisms of COVID-19-induced neuroimmune aging that may contribute to the persistence and severity of long COVID. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective interventions. Anti-inflammatory therapies, neuroprotective agents, immunomodulatory treatments, and lifestyle interventions all hold potential for mitigating the long-term effects of the virus. By addressing these challenges, we can improve health outcomes and quality of life for millions affected by the pandemic.">

        <tr id="Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, major events with immune-modulating effects at population-level included COVID-19 infection, lockdowns, and mass vaccinations campaigns. As immune responses influence many immune-mediated diseases, population scale immunological changes may have broad consequences. Methods We investigated the impact of lockdowns, COVID-19 infection and vaccinations on immune responses in the 2000HIV study including 1895 asymptomatic virally-suppressed people living with HIV recruited between October 2019 and October 2021. Their inflammatory profile was assessed by targeted plasma proteomics, immune responsiveness by cytokine production capacity of circulating immune cells, and epigenetic profile by genome-wide DNA methylation of immune cells. Results Past mild COVID-19 infection had limited long-term immune effects. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccines and especially lockdowns significantly altered both the epigenetic profile in immune cells at DNA methylation level and immune responses. Lockdowns resulted in a strong overall exaggerated immune responsiveness, while COVID-19 vaccines moderately dampened immune responses. Lockdown-associated immune responsiveness alterations were confirmed in 30 healthy volunteers from the 200FG cohort that, like the 2000HIV study, is part of the Human Functional Genomics Project. Discussion Our data suggest that lockdowns have unforeseen immunological effects. Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines have immunological effects beyond anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and studies of their impact on non-COVID-19 immune-mediated pathology are warranted.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Problem Although it is still uncertain whether Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) placental infection and vertical transmission occur, inflammation during early pregnancy can have devastating consequences for gestation itself and the growing fetus. If and how SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific immune cells negatively affect placenta functionality is still unknown. Method of study We stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from women of reproductive age with SARS‐CoV‐2 peptides and cocultured them with trophoblast spheroids (HTR‐8/SVneo and JEG‐3) to dissect if SARS‐CoV‐2‐activated immune cells can interfere with trophoblast functionality. The activation and cytokine profile of the PBMCs were determined using multicolor flow cytometry. The functionality of trophoblast spheroids was assessed using microscopy, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and RT‐qPCR. Results SARS‐CoV‐2 S and M peptides significantly activated PBMCs (monocytes, NK cells, and T cells with memory subsets) and induced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFNγ. The activated PBMCs did not impact the viability, growth rate, and invasion capabilities of trophoblast spheroids. Furthermore, the hormonal production of hCG by JEG‐3 spheroids was not compromised upon coculture with the activated PBMCs. mRNA transcript levels of genes involved in trophoblast spheroid functional pathways were also not dysregulated after coculture. Conclusions Together, the findings of our in vitro coculture model, although not fully representative of in vivo conditions, strongly support the claim that the interaction of SARS‐CoV‐2‐activated peripheral blood immune cells with trophoblast cells at the fetal–maternal interface does not negatively affect trophoblast functionality. This goes in hand with the recommendation of vaccinating pregnant women in their first trimester.">

        <tr id="The persistence or emergence of long-term symptoms following resolution of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). PASC predominantly affects the cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune systems. Among these, the central nervous system (CNS) is significantly impacted, leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, brain fog, cognitive impairment, anosmia, hypogeusia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy (neuro-PASC). However, the risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms responsible for neuro-PASC remain unclear. This review hypothesis discusses the leading hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in long COVID/PASC, focusing on neuro-PASC. We propose vascular dysfunction mediated by activation of astrocytes and pericytes followed by blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological manifestations. Additionally, we provide insights into the role of spike protein at the blood–brain interface. Finally, we explore the potential pathogenic mechanisms initiated by the interaction between the spike protein and cellular receptors at the brain endothelial and tissue levels.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and nearly 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system.Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 model. (A) Experimental diagram: Eight weeks-old K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, monitored daily for symptoms, or euthanized at 5 days post-infection (DPI) to collect tissue. (B) Daily weight measurements in K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020.

(D) Representative mouse brain hemisphere image showing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by immunohistochemical staining. Boxed regions are shown on the right. Bar: 500 µm. Methods Here using the K18-hACE2 model, we investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on major parts of neurovascular systems, and found increased incidence of microhemorrhage and significant disruption of both BBB and BCSFB in K18-hACE2 mice after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cerebral microvascular injury was accompanied by substantial pericyte damage, tight junction loss, astrogliosis, and neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma. In addition, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation occurred at both BBB and BCSFB, as shown by upregulation of VCAM-1 and COX2 markers.Figure 2: Vascular damage and BBB breakdown in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 model.

Results By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment.

Conclusion The impact of such changes, together with astrogliosis and neuroinflammation, may drive or at least contribute to the neurological complications seen in COVID-19 patients. As SARS-CoV-2 will likely remain a major health issue for years to come, our findings provide a needed understanding of its impact on the major CNS barriers and brain homeostasis at both molecular and cellular levels.

        <tr id="Humoral immunity plays a critical role in clearing SARS-CoV-2 during viral invasion. However, the proteome-wide characteristics of antibody responses in individuals infected with Omicron variant, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, remain poorly understood. We profiled the serum antibodies from 108 individuals, including healthy controls and those infected with Omicron BA.2, using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray at the amino acid resolution. We constructed a landscape of B-cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Immunodominant epitopes were mainly derived from S, N, Nsp3, M, and ORF3a proteins, with some epitopes overlapping with T-cell epitopes. Using machine learning, we identified a proteomic signature capable of distinguishing asymptomatic individuals from healthy controls in both training and validation cohorts, achieving AUCs of 0.988 and 0.857, respectively. These findings provide crucial immunological insights into BA.2 infections of the Omicron and have implications for future COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.">

        <tr id="As of early October 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, resulted in approximately 35 million cases and one million fatalities worldwide. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease marked by the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies and a lack of tolerance to nuclear self-antigens. Hypocomple-mentemia, or an abnormal blood complement deficit, is a reliable predictor of infection in SLE patients. Moreover, it has been found that immunoglobulin (Ig), particularly IgG and IgM, is lowered in SLE patients, which may be a factor in their heightened susceptibility to infection. Bloodstream autoantibodies, lymphopenia, aberrant T cells, proinflammatory cytokines, and impaired regulatory systems all lead to an immune response that is aberrant in lupus patients. SLE patients exhibit impaired CD8 T cell responses, including abnormal phagocytosis and chemotaxis. Recent study has shown that COVID-19 infections significantly boost type I inter-feron responses. Patients with SLE and Covid-19 infection typically get immune-suppressing drugs viz corticosteroids, Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK), and tocilizumab, which improve their immune systems and diminution susceptible to Covid-19 infections.">

        <tr id="This work aimed to investigate interactions between antibody-opsonized SARS-CoV-2 and monocytes enriched from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to determine whether antibody dependent enhancement might contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Pre-incubation of SARS-CoV-2 with sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients led to significantly increased virus uptake and viral replication in monocytes. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 pre-incubated with sera from patients with severe COVID-19 but not those with mild disease or post vaccination strongly increased IL-6 secretion by monocytes. Antibody dependent viral uptake was partially inhibited by monoclonal anti-FcγRIIa antibody whereas IL-6 secretion was completely abolished. FcγRIIa preferentially binds IgG2, and sera from patients with severe COVID-19 contained lower IgG2 levels as compared to mild COVID-19 cases whereas IgG1 levels were increased. These data suggests that FcγRIIa-mediated binding of antibody-opsonized SARS-CoV-2 critically impacts monocytic inflammatory cytokine release and COVID-19 pathophysiology.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is characterized by systemic pro-inflammatory shifts with the development of serious alterations in the functioning of the immune system. Investigations of the gene expression changes accompanying the infection state provide insight into the molecular and cellular processes depending on the sickness severity and virus variants. Severe Delta COVID-19 has been characterized by the appearance of a monocyte subset enriched for proinflammatory gene expression signatures and a shift in ligand–receptor interactions. We profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of 140,000 nuclei in PBMC samples from healthy individuals or individuals with COVID-19. We investigated cis-regulatory elements and identified the core transcription factors governing gene expression in immune cells during COVID-19 infection. In severe cases, we discovered that regulome and chromatin co-accessibility modules were significantly altered across many cell types. Moreover, cases with the Delta variant were accompanied by a specific monocyte subtype discovered using scATAC-seq data. Our analysis showed that immune cells of individuals with severe Delta COVID-19 underwent significant remodeling of the chromatin accessibility landscape and development of the proinflammatory expression pattern. Using a gene regulatory network modeling approach, we investigated the core transcription factors governing the cell state and identified the most pronounced chromatin changes in CD14+ monocytes from individuals with severe Delta COVID-19. Together, our results provide novel insights into cis-regulatory module organization and its impact on gene activity in immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

The patient presented with a low CD4+ lymphocyte count (CD4 count) without antiretroviral therapy (ART) and suffered from severe mpox. The ART was initiated 17 days after the diagnosis of mpox, and the patient's skin lesions began crusting after 1 week of ART. However, after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mpox flared up again. The patient presented with more severe symptoms than those during the initial bout and with rectal involvement. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause a recrudescence of mpox in AIDS patients, which requires further investigation.">

        <tr id="Abstract The development of antiviral drugs against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) responsible for the recent Covid‐19 pandemic is crucial, as treatment options remain limited and vaccination does not prevent (re)infection. Two relatively underexplored targets of this virus are the 3′‐5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) and the 2’‐O‐methyltransferase (2′‐O‐MTase), both essential for viral viability. The non‐structural proteins Nsp14 and Nsp16 exhibit enzymatic activities for ExoN and 2′‐O‐MTase, respectively, especially when in complex with their co‐factor protein Nsp10. The study focuses on the use of target‐directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (tdDCC) to identify binders of Nsp10, aiming to disturb the protein‐protein interactions (PPI) involving Nsp10‐Nsp14, as well as Nsp10‐Nsp16. We synthesised the hits and evaluated them to assess Nsp10 affinity, ExoN and 2′‐O‐MTase activities inhibition, and antiviral activity in hCoV‐229E and SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected whole‐cell settings. This study reports a novel class of ExoN and/or 2′‐O‐MTase inhibitors exhibiting antiviral activity against coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly impacted global health and has led the population and the scientific community to live in fear of a future pandemic. Based on viral infectious diseases, innate immunity cells such as mast cells and basophils play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases. Understanding these mechanisms could be essential to better study practical therapeutic approaches not only to COVID-19 but also to other viral infections widely spread worldwide, such as influenza A, HIV, and dengue. In this literature review, we want to study these concepts. Mast cells and basophils intervene as a bridge between innate and acquired immunity and seem to have a role in the damage mechanisms during infection and in the stimulation of humoral and cellular immunity. In some cases, these cells can act as reservoirs and favor the replication and spread of the virus in the body. Understanding these mechanisms can be useful not only in therapeutic but also in diagnostic and prognostic perspectives. The prospects of applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for the creation of very accurate diagnostic/prognostic tools are interesting.">

With the objective of better understanding the mechanisms leading to immune attack of the brain in this model, we evaluated the hypothesis that such mild infections are sufficient to increase blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cause brain inflammation. Pink1 wild-type (WT) and KO mice were infected with Citrobacter rodentium and at day 13 and 26 post infection, we conducted gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify signs of BBB permeability changes. Quantification of MRI results provided evidence of increased blood-brain barrier permeability in both WT and Pink1 KO mice at 26 days after the infection in the striatum, dentate gyrus, somatosensory cortex, and thalamus. This was not accompanied by any change in global expression of tight-junction proteins or in markers of the integrity of the dopamine (DA) system in the striatum at both time points. However, chronic microglial activation was detected at day 26 post infection, accompanied by an elevation of the inflammatory mediators eotaxin, IFNγ, CXCL9, IL-17 and MIP-2 in the striatum, accompanied by an elevation of IL-17 and CXCL1 in the serum of Pink1 KO mice. Neutrophil infiltration in the brain of infected mice was also noted at day 26 post infection, as revealed by immune cell profiling by flow cytometry. Finally, a bulk RNA-seq transcriptome analysis revealed that gene sets related to synaptic function were particularly influenced by the infection and that inflammation-related genes were upregulated by the infection in the Pink1 KO mice. Our results support the hypothesis that even after mild gastro-intestinal infection, increased BBB permeability could contribute to perturbations of brain homeostasis including altered expression of synaptic genes, increased microglial activation and the establishment of a chronic state of brain inflammation. Such perturbations could potentially act as a first hit for subsequent induction of PD pathology in the context of aging in genetically susceptible individuals. Author summary We hypothesize that immune system activation is linked to the development of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Previously work revealed that repeated gastrointestinal infections with Citrobacter rodentium causes PD-like symptoms and immune cell invasion in the brain of Pink1 knockout (KO) mice. In the current study, we tested whether a single mild gut infection alters blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and causes brain inflammation. We infected Pink1 WT and KO mice with Citrobacter rodentium and used gadolinium-enhanced MRI to detect BBB permeability changes at 13- and 26-days post-infection. Results showed increased BBB permeability in specific brain regions at 26 days. While tight-junction and dopamine (DA)-related proteins remained unchanged, we observed altered expression of synaptic genes, chronic microglial activation, elevated inflammatory markers, and neutrophil infiltration in the brain. Our findings suggest that even mild gastrointestinal infections can increase BBB permeability, which could be permissive for immune cell entry into the brain and potentially interact with other mechanisms triggering PD pathophysiology, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals.">

        <tr id="Despite safety concerns regarding the toxicity of tattoo ink, no studies have reported the consequences of tattooing on the immune response. In this work, we have characterized the transport and accumulation of different tattoo inks in the lymphatic system using a murine model. Upon quick lymphatic drainage, we observed that macrophages mainly capture the ink in the lymph node (LN). An initial inflammatory reaction at local and systemic levels follows ink capture. Notably, the inflammatory process is maintained over time as we observed clear signs of inflammation in the draining LN two months following tattooing. In addition, the capture of ink by macrophages was associated with the induction of apoptosis in both human and murine models. Furthermore, the ink accumulated in the LN altered the immune response against a COVID-19 vaccine. We observed a reduced antibody response following vaccination with a mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which was associated with a decreased expression of the Spike protein in macrophages in the draining LN. Considering the unstoppable trend of tattooing in the population, our results are crucial in informing the toxicology programs, policymakers, and the general public regarding the potential risk of the tattooing practice associated with an altered immune response.">

        <tr id="Introduction The high percentage of Omicron breakthrough infection in vaccinees is an emerging problem, of which we have a limited understanding of the phenomenon. Methods We performed single-cell transcriptome coupled with T-cell/B-cell receptor (TCR/BCR) sequencing in 15 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from Omicron infection and naïve with booster vaccination. Results We found that after breakthrough infection, multiple cell clusters showed activation of the type I IFN pathway and widespread expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); T and B lymphocytes exhibited antiviral and proinflammatory-related differentiation features with pseudo-time trajectories; and large TCR clonal expansions were concentrated in effector CD8 T cells, and clonal expansions of BCRs showed a preference for IGHV3. In addition, myeloid cells in the BA.5.2 breakthrough infection with the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV were characterized by enhanced proliferation, chemotactic migration, and antigen presentation. Discussion Collectively, our study informs the comprehensive understandings of immune characterization for Omicron breakthrough infection, revealing the positive antiviral potential induced by booster doses of vaccine and the possible "trained immunity" phenomenon in the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV, providing a basis for the selection of vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids. SUMMARY The neurotropic Usutu virus can cause encephalitis driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment, microglia activation and blood-brain barrier disruption, all of which are inhibited by glucocorticoid treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a significant global public health challenge. While respiratory symptoms dominate, the virus's impact on other systems, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), has gained increasing attention. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates tropism for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, expressed in the olfactory epithelium, lungs, endothelium, kidneys, enterocytes, and neurons, contributing to neurological manifestations observed during the acute phase of the disease.  
Materials and Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. Keywords included: COVID-19, Post Acute COVID-19 Syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 Virus, Neurological Manifestations, and Central Nervous System Viral Diseases. A total of 58 articles were selected for analysis based on relevance and quality of evidence regarding neurological symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19.  
Basic Results: The acute phase of COVID-19 frequently involves neurological symptoms such as frontal and holocranial headaches, dizziness, gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, and alterations in consciousness. Severe complications, though less common, include encephalitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and myelitis. These conditions often present as altered mental status, seizures, aphasia, headaches, or focal deficits, contributing substantially to patient morbidity and mortality.  
Conclusions: Neurological symptoms and complications constitute a significant aspect of COVID-19, highlighting the virus's potential to affect the CNS. While severe complications are rare, their profound impact on prognosis underscores the importance of early recognition and management. Further research is essential to understand the pathophysiology and optimise therapeutic approaches for affected patients. ">

        <tr id="Background/Aim Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, manifests a wide range of clinical symptoms ranging from mild to moderate and severe. Host-related factors influence the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection; for instance, the expression of host microRNAs (miRNAs) could influence the progression and complications of COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the expression pattern of endogenous miRNAs in 80 severe COVID-19 patients compared to a group of healthy individuals. Materials and Methods The miRNA screening expression analysis was performed using TaqMan Low-Density Array, and the expression changes of miR-490-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-454-3p, and miR-431-5p were validated using RT-qPCR. In silico analysis was used to identify new targets and predict the pathways, biological processes, and interactions of the selected miRNAs. Results The miR-490-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-454-3p, and miR-431-5p, were over-expressed in the total population of severe COVID-19 patients compared to the control group. miR-490-3p was found to be over-expressed in both female and male COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Specific miRNAs might be a potential biomarker for predicting the clinical course of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection disturbs the coagulation balance in the blood, triggering thrombosis and contributing to organ failure. The role of prothrombotic metabolites in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains elusive. Leveraging K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, we observed higher levels of the tryptophan metabolite, kynurenine, compared to controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed a significant upregulation of enzymes controlling Kynurenine biogenesis, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase levels in kidneys and liver, respectively, as well as changes in the enzymes involved in kynurenine catabolism, including kynurenine monooxygenase and kynurinase. Consistent with the agonistic role of these metabolites in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) signaling, AHR activation and its downstream mediator, tissue factor (TF), a highly potent procoagulant factor, was observed in endothelial cells (ECs) of lungs and kidneys of infected mice. These findings were validated in humans, where compared to controls, sera of COVID-19 patients showed increased levels of Kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid. Activation of the AHR-TF axis was noted in the kidneys and lungs of COVID-19 patients, and COVID-19 sera showed higher IDO-1 activity than controls. Levels of Kyn in COVID-19 patients correlated strongly with the TF-inducing activity of COVID-19 sera on ECs. A specific IDO-1 inhibitor or AHR inhibitor separately or in combination suppressed COVID-19 sera-induced TF activity in ECs. Together, we identified IDO-1 as upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in augmented Kyn and its prothrombotic catabolites, thereby suggesting the Kyn-AHR-TF axis as possibly a new diagnostic and/or therapeutic target. Key points SARS-CoV-2-infection upregulates kynurenine biogenesis in the liver and diminishes kynurenine catabolism in the lungs and kidneys. An increase in kynurenine stimulates the AHR-TF axis in the microvasculature in COVID-19 patients, which is inhibited by pharmacological manipulation.">

        <tr id="Aberrant and sustained activation of microglia is implicated in the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether intrinsic alterations in microglial function impact the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. We conducted transcriptomic and functional analyses of microglia-like cells (iMGLs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MS (pwMS) to answer this question. We generated iPSCs from six pwMS showing increased microglial activity via translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging. We demonstrated that the differentiated iMGL transcriptional profile resembled the microglial signature found in MS lesions. Importantly, compared with healthy controls, MS iMGLs presented cell-autonomous differences in their regulation of inflammation, both in the basal state and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide challenge. Through transcriptomic profiling, we showed that MS iMGLs display increased expression of genes known to be upregulated in MS microglia. Furthermore, upregulated genes in MS iMGLs were associated with immune receptor activation, antigen presentation, and the complement system, with known MS implications. Finally, functional analyses indicated that the transcriptional changes in MS iMGLs corresponded with alterations in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased phagocytosis. Together, our results provide evidence of putative cell-autonomous microglial activation in pwMS and identify transcriptomic and functional changes that recapitulate the phenotypes observed in vivo in microglia from pwMS. These findings indicate that MS disease-specific iPSCs are valuable tools for studying disease-specific microglial activation in vitro and highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets in MS.">

CSF derives from and borders central nervous system (CNS) tissue, allowing for comprehensive accounting of cell types along with their relative abundance and immunologic profiles relevant to CNS diseases. Using integration techniques applied to publicly available datasets in combination with our own studies, we generated a compendium with 139 subjects encompassing 135 CSF and 58 blood samples. Healthy subjects and individuals across a wide range of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, COVID-19, and autoimmune encephalitis, were included. We found differences in lymphocyte and myeloid subset frequencies across different diseases as well as in their distribution between blood and CSF. We identified what we believe to be a new subset of AREG+ dendritic cells exclusive to the CSF that was more abundant in subjects with MS compared with healthy controls. Finally, transcriptional cell states in CSF microglia-like cells and lymphoid subsets were elucidated. Altogether, we have created a reference compendium for single-cell transcriptional profiling encompassing CSF immune cells useful to the scientific community for future studies on neurologic diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute COVID-19 infection causes significant alterations in the innate and adaptive immune systems. While most individuals recover naturally, some develop long COVID (LC) syndrome, marked by persistent or new symptoms weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, there are no clinical tests to distinguish LC patients from those fully recovered. Understanding the immunological basis of LC is essential for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches. Methods We performed deep immunophenotyping and functional assays to examine the immunological profiles of LC patients, individuals with active COVID-19, recovered patients, and healthy donors. This analysis assessed both innate and adaptive immune features, identifying potential biomarkers for LC syndrome. A Binomial Generalized Linear Model (BGLM) was used to pinpoint immune features characterizing LC. Results COVID-19 patients exhibited depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes, and monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells. Elevated basal inflammation was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to LC patients, whose immune profiles were closer to those of healthy donors and recovered individuals. However, LC patients displayed persistent immune alterations, including reduced T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Tregs) and switched memory B cells, similar to COVID-19 patients. Through BGLM, a unique adaptive immune signature for LC was identified, featuring memory CD8 and gd T cells with low proliferative capacity and diminished expression of activation and homing receptors. Discussion The findings highlight a unique immunological signature associated with LC syndrome, characterized by persistent adaptive immune dysregulation. While LC patients displayed recovery in innate immune profiles comparable to healthy and Recovered individuals, deficits in T cell and memory B cell populations were evident, differentiating LC from full recovery. These findings provide insights into LC pathogenesis and may support the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Many common symptoms in post-acute sequelae following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) overlap with those of multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined symptoms and performance of the PASC score, developed in the general population, in MS based on infection history.


METHODS
We surveyed North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry participants regarding infections and categorized participants based on infection history. Symptoms experienced before, during, and after infection were used to identify persistent new symptoms. PASC was defined as a score ⩾ 12 based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study RECOVER.


RESULTS
Of 4787 participants surveyed, 2927 were included: 294 (10%) having recent COVID-19; 853 (29.1%) recent non-COVID-19 infection; 246 (8.4%) recent COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infection; 1534 (52.4%) uninfected, defined as never having COVID-19 nor any infection within the past 6 months. Compared to those uninfected, infection groups reported at least a two-fold increase in fever, cough, loss of smell/taste, and shortness of breath. Based on persistent new symptoms, PASC was identified in only 1.5% of participants with COVID-19.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests lower than expected prevalence of PASC in MS and a complex association between infections and development of new persistent symptoms following infections. The similar proportions classified with PASC across infection groups shows that symptoms of PASC are common and complicate assessment of PASC in MS.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with the enveloped RNA betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, led to a global pandemic involving over 7 million deaths. Macrophage inflammatory responses impact COVID-19 severity; however, it is unclear whether macrophages are infected by SARS-CoV-2. We sought to identify mechanisms regulating macrophage expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and to determine if macrophages are susceptible to productive infection. We developed a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mouse whereby hACE2 cDNA was cloned into the mouse ACE2 locus under control of the native promoter. We validated susceptibility of hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to wild-type mice and an established K18-hACE2 model of acute fulminating disease. Intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 led to pulmonary consolidations with cellular infiltrate, edema, and hemorrhage, consistent with pneumonia, yet unlike the K18-hACE2 model, hACE2 mice survived and maintained stable weight. Infected hACE2 mice also exhibited a unique plasma chemokine, cytokine, and growth factor inflammatory signature relative to K18-hACE2 mice. Infected hACE2 mice demonstrated evidence of viral replication in infiltrating lung macrophages, and infection of macrophages in vitro revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of altered RNA and ribosomal processing machinery as well as activated cellular antiviral defense. Macrophage IL-1β-driven NF-κB transcription of ACE2 was an important mechanism of dynamic ACE2 upregulation, promoting macrophage susceptibility to infection. Experimental models of COVID-19 that make use of native hACE2 expression will allow for mechanistic insight into factors that can either promote host resilience or increase susceptibility to worsening severity of infection.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives: Severe COVID-19 still constitutes an important health problem. Taking into account the crucial role of HLA in immune reactions, evaluation of the impact of HLA on COVID-19 risk and clinical course seemed necessary, as the already available data are inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to compare the HLA profiles of patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and a healthy control group, as well as to compare HLA allele frequencies in patients with severe and non-severe courses of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: HLA classes were genotyped using a next-generation sequencing method in 2322 persons, including 2217 healthy hematopoietic stem cell potential donors and 105 patients with symptomatic COVID-19. Results: Symptomatic course of SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be associated with the presence of HLA-A*30:01, B*44:02, B*52:01, C*05:01, C*17:01, and DRB1*11:02, while HLA-C*07:04 and DQB1*03:03 seem to play a protective role. Moreover, we demonstrated that the severe symptomatic course of COVID-19 can be associated with the presence of HLA-B*08:01, C*04:01, DRB1*03:01, and DQB1*03:01, while HLA-DRB1*08:01 appeared to be protective against severe COVID-19 disease. Conclusions: Identification of alleles that are potentially associated with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the severe course of COVID-19 broadens the knowledge on the genetic background of COVID-19 course and can constitute an important step in the development of personalized medicine.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is central to temporal lobe epilepsy, yet the specific role of myeloid cells remains unclear. In status epilepticus (SE) models, circulating monocytes have been reported to infiltrate the brain, though distinguishing them from microglia remains challenging. Using a rat model, we traced infiltrating monocytes post-SE, to investigate their persistence, phenotypic evolution during epileptogenesis and contribution to neuroinflammation. By tracking phagocyted fluorescent nanoparticles and using CD68 immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that monocytes entered the brain in significant numbers 24 hours post-SE, after the inflammatory peak occurred (7h post-SE). Tracked up to 7 weeks, these cells adopted a microglia-like phenotype, contributed to the microglial scar and sustained low-grade inflammation during the chronic phase of epilepsy solely through their presence, as their expression of pro-inflammatory markers resembled that of non-activated microglia. Importantly, monocytes initially and transiently supported an anti-inflammatory response providing a unique opportunity to modulate neuroinflammation and potentially disrupt epilepsy progression, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Vaccines are the most effective tool against COVID-19 and are generally safe. Very rare and heterogeneous cases of acute liver injury associated to all types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been reported, mostly with autoimmune features. Epidemiological studies used heterogeneous diagnostic criteria and included different populations. Immunological studies in selected cases of acute liver injury linked to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines suggest that it has a unique pathophysiology, the vaccine-encoded spike protein playing a central role in triggering the aberrant immune response. In most series, liver injury was observed more often following the second vaccine dose. Latency from vaccination to the diagnosis of hepatitis was 1-147 days after the last vaccine dose. Raised immunoglobulin G levels and positive anti-nuclear and/or anti-smooth muscle antibodies are frequent. The vast majority of reported cases have been treated with corticosteroids, mostly associated with azathioprine. Outcome is generally favourable, but cases requiring liver transplantation or causing death have been reported. The heterogeneous clinical entity of acute liver injury linked to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines includes patients requiring long-term immunosuppression, similarly to autoimmune hepatitis, and patients with self-limiting liver damage, possibly representing a unique form of autoimmune-like hepatitis, which we suggest being referred to as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated liver injury (SVALI). Further studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms related to the immune response to the spike viral protein in the liver.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), alarmed the global community due to the significant loss of human lives during the pandemic. However, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. A positive aspect of this recent pandemic has been that it stimulated scientists to create vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, accelerating the emergence of new therapeutic agents based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Numerous mRNA therapeutic products are currently in development, with dozens at various clinical trial stages. These products have facilitated significant changes in the paradigm of medical therapy, including the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although most of these cardiovascular mRNA therapeutics are still in preclinical development, phase IIa trials for myocardial ischemia therapy have already been completed with encouraging results. The scope of mRNA therapy for CVD is extremely broad, potentially even limitless, with ongoing research including conditions like myocardial ischemia, heart failure, arrhythmias, hypercholesterolemia, and occlusive arterial diseases. Moreover, mRNA can be used to enhance the effectiveness of cell therapies. In the future, researchers predict that mRNA therapies will not only replace some existing biopharmaceuticals and pharmacotherapy methods but also be applied to treat previously considered untreatable cardiovascular diseases.">

Data regarding functional roles of human T cells in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) viral clearance in primary COVID-19 are limited. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed samples for associations between SARS2 upper respiratory tract viral RNA levels and early virus-specific adaptive immune responses for 95 unvaccinated clinical trial participants with acute primary COVID-19 aged 18–86 years old, approximately half of whom were considered at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Functionality and magnitude of acute SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated, in addition to antibody responses. Most individuals with acute COVID-19 developed SARS2-specific T cell responses within 6 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Early CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were polyfunctional, and both strongly associated with reduced upper respiratory tract SARS2 viral RNA, independent of neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, these findings provide evidence for protective roles for circulating SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and long-term complications in bone health. Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces bone turnover and promotes bone loss, but the mechanism underlying worsened bone health remains elusive. This study sought to identify specific immune mediators that exacerbated preexisting IMIDs after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Plasma samples from 4 groups were analyzed: healthy, IMID only, COVID-19 only, and COVID-19 + IMID. Using high-throughput multiplexed proteomics, we profiled 1,500 protein biomarkers and identified 148 unique biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with IMIDs, including elevated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17F) and bone resorption markers. Long-term circulating SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, a virulence factor for COVID-19, was detected in the COVID + IMID group. RA was one of the most common IMIDs in our study. ORF8 treatment of RA-derived human osteoblasts (RA-hOBs) increased levels of inflammatory (TNF, IL6, CCL2) and bone resorption (RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio) markers compared with healthy controls. Supernatants from ORF8-treated RA-hOBs drove the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast-like cells. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exposure can exacerbate IMIDs through ORF8-driven inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19–induced bone pathologies.">

Recent studies have reported that severe cases of COVID-19 are primarily characterized
by endotheliitis (or endothelialitis), whose severity is related to the pre-existing or current damage to
the complex structure that lines the surface of the vascular endothelium, most notably the glycocalyx.
Such damage results in the loss of many endothelial cell functions. To restore these functions, the
cell must repair the glycocalyx that covers it. However, this is not always possible, especially when
the repair capacity of such an exo-endo-cytoplasmic cell structure is limited due to cellular senescence.
If the gene repair system remains activated, the damaged glycocalyx can be reconstituted via
specific transcriptional pathways in response to oxidative and reductive stresses. Despite the experimental
evidence in favour of this hypothesis, many of the recently published reviewrs on long
COVID do not mention the use of therapeutic treatments via specific 'oxidative eustress'. In fact,
mild and controlled oxidative stress is able to induce an activating response to cellular damage repair
processes. This perspective aims to draw the attention of researchers to these aspects in an attempt to
address this gap in understanding.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic and devastating health crisis. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), and the exaggerated immune response resulting from infection with this disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality.  Activation may have a contribution to disease severity.A case study was carried out in order to find the association between COVID-19, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2. The effect of age, sex, smoking, diabetic and hypertention on the level of the studied cytokines were evaluated. Inaddition, the influnce of COVID-19 severity on TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2 levels were studied. Blood samples were collected from 50 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who visited of Al-Hussein Teaching hospital and 50 control people, during the period from (May -November 2021). The ages of the patients ranged from (Twenty two years to seventy six years). The serum samples were used in detection of TNF-α , IL-8 and IL-2  by using ELISA test. Then   the collected data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 11. The results showed that that the most affected age group was (40-60) years old followed by less than 40 years old and more than 60 years old. The numbers of patients were 29, 11 and 10 respectively. Most of COVID-19 patients were male (56 %:28), while the rest cases were females (44%:22). The mean values of the studied cytokines in COVID-19 patients in both sex and all age groups were more than their counter parters in H.C group. The effect of main risk factors for severe and long COVID-19 include age, sex, smoking, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension) on variations in the level of studied cytokines of the host were found significantly. Moreover, the effect of COVID-19 severity on the studied cytokines was highly significants. The maximum values of cytokines were obtaind in critical degree followed by severe and moderate severity.  It is concluded from the study's results that patients infected with severe SARS-CoV-2 experience increasing proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 that produce signaling the initial phase of cytokine storm. Thus, further studies should be conducted to use the studied cytokines inhibitors as a treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 global pandemic, leads to a wide variety of responses among patients. Some of them present a very severe phenotype, while others only experience mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. This differential prognosis is tightly related to the inflammatory status of the patient. Although WHO declared the end of the emergency, the pandemic caused a great socio-sanitary impact in all countries. Thus, the possible outbreak of new biological diseases in the future makes it necessary to deepen the knowledge of this uncontrolled immune response and look for reliable biomarkers to help us predict its potential health impact. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) as lipoxins are endogenous mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid in the resolution stage of any inflammatory process. These lipids have pro-resolving actions in several pathological models, including reducing NF-κB-mediated inflammation, and inducing the antioxidant response through the Nrf-2 pathway. Thus, although a potential relationship has already been suggested between low levels of SPMs and COVID-19 severity, their true role as a predictive biomarker is still unknown.In this study, we have analyzed by ELISA the serum levels of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in a representative Spanish cohort. We found reduced levels in deceased patients when compared to mild or severe patients, concomitant with a decrease in the LXA4 biosynthetic pathway and an increase in its degradation pathway. Furthermore, we have studied the correlation between the levels of this SPM and several pathology indicators, finding a significant correlation between increased LXA4 levels and a better prognosis of the patients.We propose to measure systemic LXA4 as a new promising biomarker to predict the survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and presumably to other viruses that can affect humanity in the future.">

        <tr id="Background Several years after the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of trained immunity in COVID-19 remains controversial, and questions regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19 on immune cells remain unresolved. We investigated the roles of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination and latent infections in the progression of COVID-19 and sepsis. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of 97 individuals recovering from mild-to-critical COVID-19 and 64 sepsis patients. Immune cell frequencies, expression of functional markers, and plasma titres of anti-Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies were assessed and their impact on disease severity and outcomes were determined. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS. Results Post COVID-19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterized mainly by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post-critical COVID-19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. Additionally, a higher frequency of CMV and T. gondii seropositive-alongside a lower frequency of BCG seropositive-patients were associated with severe and critical COVID-19. However, the monocyte response to stimulation was unaffected by the severity of COVID-19. Conclusion These findings highlight the long-term alterations of immune cells in post-COVID-19 patients emphasizing the substantial impact of COVID-19 on immune function. However, our data showed no relationship between previous BCG vaccination and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The adaptive immune response plays a crucial role in resolution of viral infections; however, there is limited data on the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines like Sinopharm (Sin), Sputnik-V (SpV), and especially for the heterologous combination Sputnik-V/mRNA-1273 (Spv/Mod) scheme. Furthermore, emerging variants may compromise the adaptive immune response established in the population. Objective: To evaluate the T cell immune response induced by the Sin, SpV and SpV/Mod, against Wuhan, Gamma and Omicron viral variants. Methods: Serum levels of IgG antibodies were assessed by CMIA (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois). T cell responses against Wuhan, Gamma, and Omicron were evaluated through an activation-induced marker assay. Sixty individuals, evenly distributed across the Sin, SpV, and SpV/Mod groups, were included. Results: The median age of participants was 48 years (IQR: 34-56), with 58.3% (n=35) being female. Seventeen (28.3%) individuals had a prior confirmed COVID-19 infection. Spv/Mod scheme elicited significantly higher humoral responses (p<0.001). However, the three vaccination platforms showed consistent T cell responses across the different Wuhan, Gamma and Omicron stimuli tested. Particularly, all three schemes induced stronger CD8 responses against the Wuhan variant. In addition, more responders to Wuhan were observed in the Sin and Spv groups, while the Spv/Mod group showed a higher proportion of responders to Omicron. Conclusion: This study provides new data on effective humoral and cellular immune responses against Wuhan, Gamma, and Omicron variants. Moreover, memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses remain protective, and the heterologous scheme may elicit stronger T cell responses against emerging variants.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), is a major concern due to its astonishing prevalence and high fatality rate, especially among elderly people. Patients suffering from COVID‐19 may exhibit immunosuppression in the initial stage of infection, while a cytokine storm can occur when the disease progresses to a severe stage. This inopportune immune rhythm not only makes patients more susceptible to the virus but also leads to numerous complications resulting from the excessive production of inflammatory factors. A20, which is widely accepted as a pivotal regulator of inflammation, has been shown to be implicated in the processes of antiviral responses and immunosuppression. Thus, A20 may participate in regulating the pathological processes of COVID‐19. Methods This narrative literature review summarizes recent evidence on the mechanisms of A20 in regulating the pathological processes of COVID‐19. We also downloaded single‐cell RNA‐seq data sets from healthy individuals and patients with varying severities of COVID‐19 from the NCBI GEO database to further dissect A20's regulatory mechanisms of these intricate cytokine pathways that are closely associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results A20 might be one of the most critical anti‐infectious and anti‐inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19. It effectively suppresses the immune damage and inflammatory storm caused by viral infection. Conclusions Understanding the relationship between A20‐regulated signaling pathways and pathological processes of COVID‐19 can provide insight into potential targets for intervention. Precise regulation of A20 to induce antiviral activity and an anti‐inflammatory response could mediate the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 and could become an effective treatment.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) ESX-1, a type VII secretion system, is a key virulence determinant contributing to MTB’s survival within lung mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), but its effect on MNP recruitment and differentiation remains unknown. Here, using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing techniques, we studied the role of ESX-1 in MNP heterogeneity and response in mice and murine bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDM). We found that ESX-1 is required for MTB to recruit diverse MNP subsets with high MTB burden. Further, MTB induces a transcriptional signature of immune evasion in lung macrophages and BMDM in an ESX-1–dependent manner. Spatial transcriptomics revealed an up-regulation of permissive features within MTB lesions, where monocyte-derived macrophages concentrate near MTB-infected cells. Together, our findings suggest that MTB ESX-1 facilitates the recruitment and differentiation of MNPs, which MTB can infect and manipulate for survival. Our dataset across various models and methods could contribute to the broader understanding of recruited cell heterogeneity during MTB lung infection.">

        <tr id="Background In endemic COVID-19, immunocompromised children are vulnerable until vaccinated but the optimal primary vaccination regime and need for booster doses remains uncertain. Methods We recruited 19 immunocompromised children (post-solid organ transplantation, have autoimmune disease or were on current or recent chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and followed them from the start of primary vaccination with BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 until 1-year post-vaccination. We investigated the quality of vaccine immunogenicity, and longevity of hybrid immunity, in comparison to healthy children. Results Immunocompromised children failed to produce T cell and memory B cell (MBC) responses reaching thresholds of protection after 2 doses; a third dose however improved both responses. Initially robust hybrid immunity demonstrated significantly more decline in T cell and MBC responses in immunocompromised compared to healthy children, to levels below the protective threshold by month 12. Discussion Immunocompromised children may benefit from a 3-dose primary vaccination regime, with yearly or twice-yearly booster doses for sustained immunity.">

        <tr id="Anti-Aβ immunotherapy use to treat Alzheimer's disease is on the rise. While anti-Aβ antibodies provide hope in targeting Aβ plaques in the brain, there still remains a lack of understanding regarding the cellular responses to these antibodies in the brain. In this study, we sought to identify the acute effects of anti-Aβ antibodies on immune responses. To determine cellular changes due to anti-Aβ antibody exposure, we intracranially injected 14 mo APP male and female mice with anti-Aβ IgG1 (6E10) or control IgG1 into the cortex. After 24 h or 3 d, we harvested the cortex and performed a glial cell-enriched preparation for single-cell sequencing. Cell types, proportions, and cell-to-cell signaling were evaluated between the two injection conditions and two acute timepoints. We identified 23 unique cell clusters including microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells, neurons, oligos/OPCs, immune cells, and unknown. The anti-Aβ antibody-injected cortices revealed more ligand–receptor (L–R) communications between cell types, as well as stronger communications at only 24 h. At 3 d, while there were more L–R communications for the anti-Aβ antibody condition, the strength of these connections was stronger in the control IgG condition. We also found evidence of an initial and strong communication emphasis in microglia-to-nonparenchymal immune cells at 24 h, specifically in the TGFβ signaling pathway. We identify several pathways that are specific to anti-Aβ antibody exposure at acute timepoints. These data lay the groundwork for understanding the brain's unique response to anti-Aβ antibodies.">

The phagocytic activity of leukocytes was studied in admitted patients with COVID-associated lung disease (n = 105). The mean age of the studied patients was 43.5 (37; 51) years; 69 for men, and 36 for women; the mean duration of the disease before hospitalization was 6 (4; 8) days. Using cluster analysis, two groups of patients (clusters) were formed according to the severity of COVID-19: Group 1 with the moderate course (n = 34) and Group 2 with the mild course (n = 71). Flow cytofluorimetry with determination of neutrophil (NI) and monocyte index (MI) was used to determine the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes in the peripheral blood.Results. The median NI in the studied patients was 97.9% (96.3; 99); the mean median MI was 91.2% (84.6; 95). The correlation analysis revealed statistically significant direct correlation of MI with SpO2 level (r = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.005 – 0.39; p = 0.04); inverse correlation of MI with CRP level (r = –0.31; 95% CI: –0.11 to –0.48; p = 0.003) and degree of lung damage by CT (r = –0.2; 95% CI: –0.11 to –0.48); p = 0.05). MI in the group with moderate course was statistically significantly lower than in the group with mild course of COVID-19 (86.7 (81.4; 91.7) and 92.6 (86.5; 95.4), p = 0.01). The blood MI of the initially more severe patients statistically significantly increased.Conclusion. Complicated forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection lead to a decrease in phagocytic activity of the monocytic-macrophage link of innate immunity. The degree of decrease in monocyte phagocytic activity is directly related to the severity of COVID-19, and the MI is comparable in the patients with severe and mild course after 30 days of treatment.">

Cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of mortality following infection. In this review, we discuss immune pathogenesis and four medications, including Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Dexamethasone, and Annual SZ for COVID-19. A comparison of the effectiveness and therapeutic usage of drugs as reported in clinical trials and reports was made at different disease levels as well. Clinical studies indicate that Annual SZ with mild side effects was more affordable and might be more effective than other medications. Additionally, Annual SZ was capable of reducing the lev-els of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as viral attachment and RNA replication.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The majority of COVID-19 infections in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological (Heme-Onc) diagnoses are mild with good outcome compared to adults. Postulated reasons include cross-protection from immunity against seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV’s), subdued inflammatory responses in children than in adults and differences in humoral and T-cell responses. The objectives of this study are to compare antibody responses against HCoV’s, anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral, T-cell, and inflammatory profiles between Heme-Onc children with COVID-19 and control groups. Methods Binding IgG antibodies against Spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2, four HCoV’s (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), quantitative levels of 21 cytokines and 9 chemokines (multiplexed solid-phase electrochemiluminescence assay by Meso Scale Diagnostics/MSD) were compared among five cohorts: 1) children with Heme-Onc diagnoses and COVID-19 (n = 41) 2) healthy children with COVID-19 (n = 21) 3) adults with COVID-19 (n = 14) 4) children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) [n = 23] and 5) healthy children without COVID-19 (n = 12). Additionally, T-cell responses against S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using ELISpot in Heme-Onc children a group of healthy children COVID-19. Results Anti-S antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV were significantly lower in children in Heme-Onc and healthy children with COVID-19 compared to adults with COVID-19 (Figure 1). The concentration of eight pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly lower in Heme-Onc and healthy children compared to adults with COVID-19 and children with MIS-C. The responder T-cell frequency varied between 0 and 860/100,000 PBMC at study enrollment in children with Heme-Onc diagnoses. Conclusion In this single-center study, cross-protection from HCoV antibodies is an unlikely mechanism to explain mild COVID-19 in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological diagnoses. Subdued inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be one of the factors for the mild COVID-19 disease phenotype in children.

To study its pathogenesis, we developed a human challenge model in which we infect the skin on the upper arm of human volunteers with H. ducreyi to the pustular stage of disease. The model has been used to define lesional architecture, describe the immune infiltrate into the infected sites using flow cytometry, and explore the molecular basis of the immune response using bulk RNA-seq. Here, we used single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to simultaneously characterize multiple cell types within infected human skin and determine the cellular origin of differentially expressed transcripts that we had previously identified by bulk RNA-seq. We obtained paired biopsies of pustules and wounded (mock infected) sites from five volunteers for scRNA-seq. We identified 13 major cell types, including T- and NK-like cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, as well as other cell types typically found in the skin. Immune cell types were enriched in pustules, and some subtypes within the major cell types were exclusive to pustules. Sufficient tissue specimens for spatial transcriptomics were available from four of the volunteers. T- and NK-like cells were highly associated with multiple antigen presentation cell types. In pustules, type I interferon stimulation was high in areas that were high in antigen presentation-especially in macrophages near the abscess-compared to wounds. Together, our data provide a high-resolution view of the cellular immune response to the infection of the skin with a human pathogen.IMPORTANCEA high-resolution view of the immune infiltrate due to infection with an extracellular bacterial pathogen in human skin has not yet been defined. Here, we used the human skin pathogen Haemophilus ducreyi in a human challenge model to identify on a single cell level the types of cells that are present in volunteers who fail to spontaneously clear infection and form pustules. We identified 13 major cell types. Immune cells and immune-activated stromal cells were enriched in pustules compared to wounded (mock infected) sites. Pustules formed despite the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and type I interferon. Interferon stimulation was most evident in macrophages, which were proximal to the abscess. The pro-inflammatory response within the pustule may be tempered by regulatory T cells and cells that express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, leading to failure of the immune system to clear H. ducreyi.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic now had a broad impact on the health care system since its start. Cancer patients, specifically lung cancer patients, are undergoing a more vulnerable group due to their complex pathophysiological and immunological characteristics. Therefore, they need more attention and care about health and treatment. It is yet unknown how SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infected lung cancer patient's health and management of treatment impacts them. From a clinical and multidisciplinary perspective, we aimed to explain our main priorities concerning COVID-19 infection in the scenario of lung cancer patients’ group in this chapter. Various types of lung cancer therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, can all significantly increase the risk, therefore making a patient's chances of a poor outcome higher. Patients with lung cancer need regular clinical and radiologic examinations and follow-ups, which the COVID-19 pandemic might hamper. COVID-19-related lung cancer patients’ incidental radiologic abnormalities might show up in regular radiology exams, making it challenging to understand disease progression and the effect of therapy. The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted lung cancer care, highlighting challenges in patient management, treatment outcomes, and ethical dilemmas. Quantitative analysis and exploration of future directions would enhance clinical and research impact. In addition, cancer treatment-induced pneumonitis can exhibit radiologic characteristics that are identical to those seen in acute SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, possibly due to a wrong diagnosis and misinterpretation. The current COVID-19 health crisis is affecting many healthcare requirements, including the necessity for regular healthcare accessibility, particularly follow-ups, and the clinical trials in which this patient group may be included. The COVID-19 epidemic has placed healthcare practitioners, scientists, researchers, and institutions in a complex and dangerous situation, forcing them to address challenges with ethical scenarios.">

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes have been implicated as central mediators of neuroinflammatory processes in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory roles and interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a compartmentalized microfluidic chip coculture platform. This novel platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of fluidically isolated microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 hours. The glial activation and crosstalk were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were successfully generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic chip platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Notably, the levels of secreted inflammatory mediators were altered under coculture conditions, revealing significant glial crosstalk. Utilization of our microfluidic coculture platform facilitated the study of microglial migration and glial activation within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Microglia migrated efficiently toward the astrocyte compartment, and the chemoattractant adenosine diphosphate (ADP) notably increased microglial migration within this platform. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation of the microfluidic chip cocultures successfully recapitulated glial crosstalk, revealing unique responses. This crosstalk was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3 in the cocultures, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate molecular crosstalk between inflammatory microglia and astrocytes, providing evidence of how glial cells orchestrate responses during neuroinflammation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the microfluidic coculture platform developed in this study for microglia and astrocytes provides a more functional and enhanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.">

        <tr id="Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are a major cause of morbidity largely due to lack of prevention and inadequate treatments. While mortality from viral CNS infections is significant, nearly two thirds of the patients survive. Thus, it is important to understand how the human CNS can successfully control virus infection and recover. Since it is not possible to study the human CNS throughout the course of viral infection at the cellular level, here we analyzed a non-lethal viral infection in the CNS of nonhuman primates (NHPs). We inoculated NHPs intracerebrally with a high dose of La Crosse virus (LACV), a bunyavirus that can infect neurons and cause encephalitis primarily in children, but with a very low (≤ 1%) mortality rate. To profile the CNS response to LACV infection, we used an integrative approach that was based on comprehensive analyses of (i) spatiotemporal dynamics of virus replication, (ii) identification of types of infected neurons, (iii) spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and (iv) morphological and functional changes in CNS intrinsic and extrinsic cells. We identified the location, timing, and functional repertoire of optimal transcriptional and translational regulation of the primate CNS in response to virus infection of neurons. These CNS responses involved a well-coordinated spatiotemporal interplay between astrocytes, lymphocytes, microglia, and CNS-border macrophages. Our findings suggest a multifaceted program governing an optimal CNS response to virus infection with specific events coordinated in space and time. This allowed the CNS to successfully control the infection by rapidly clearing the virus from infected neurons, mitigate damage to neurophysiology, activate and terminate immune responses in a timely manner, resolve inflammation, restore homeostasis, and initiate tissue repair. An increased understanding of these processes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve outcomes of viral CNS diseases in humans.">

        <tr id="The long-term effects of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations on adaptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several cardiovascular complications, including myocarditis, which can be a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause cardiac muscle inflammation through direct mechanisms, such as viral invasion of myocardial cells, and indirect mechanisms, such as the systemic inflammatory response. Myocarditis can lead to life-threatening electrical dysfunctions and arrhythmias. Although post-infection myocarditis is more common, rare cases of post-vaccination myocarditis have also been reported, especially with mRNA vaccines. However, these post-vaccination cases tend to be mild and self-limiting, with a good response to treatment. Despite the associated risks, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, significantly reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections and related heart complications. It is crucial to continue surveillance and research to better understand the association between COVID-19, myocarditis and sudden cardiac death in the young and improve prevention and intervention strategies. In this literature review, we analyzed the pathogenetic mechanisms and histological features of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 and its vaccination, and focused on the correlation with sudden cardiac death.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Understanding the behavior of B cells during infection and vaccination is important for determining protective humoral immunity. We evaluated the profile of humoral immunity and B cell pool in individuals who were acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2, recovered from COVID-19, or received two doses of the AZD1222 vaccine. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these individuals were subjected to in vitro stimulation to promote the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and the ELISpot evaluated the abundance of pan and SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1-reactive IgG+ ASC. Stimulated PBMCs were characterized using flow cytometry. Culture supernatants were assessed for soluble B-cell-activating factors. The IgA and IgG for the S1 were evaluated through ELISA. Results: The recovered individuals displayed a robust S1 ASC compared to acute and vaccinated individuals. Although the frequency of total B cells or B cell subsets did not vary among the groups, plasmablast cells were increased in naïve and double-negative B cells in the acute, recovered, and vaccinated individuals. Similar IgA and IgG production appeared to be present in the acute and recovered individuals. During vaccination, more IgG is produced than IgA. In acute patients, BAFF levels were positively correlated with total B cells and IgG+ plasmablast cells but negatively correlated with IgA+ plasmablast cells. Conclusions: Vaccination and natural infection with COVID-19 induce a differential profile and functionality of B cells. We suggest that new vaccines against COVID-19 incorporate molecular adjuvants that regulate B lymphocyte functionality and consider the beneficial aspects of the IgA response in addition to IgG.">

        <tr id="The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection is reported to begin with the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human body through droplets, entering the lungs, and binding to the ACE-2 receptor. Meanwhile, activated macrophages stimulate an immune and inflammatory response, activating the coagulation cascade. This activation in COVID-19 patients can exacerbate the condition and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The coagulation cascade is influenced by the expression of related genes, including F3, F5, F8, F12, F13A1, VWF, THBD, PROC, PROCR, PROS1, SERPINE1, A2M, and PLAUR. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022, with 22 mild COVID-19 cases, 35 moderate-to-severe cases, and 20 healthy control individuals from Dr. M. Djamil Padang General Hospital in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Coagulation gene expression data using the RNA-Seq method with transcriptomic analysis were collected and recorded in transcript per-million (TPM) units. The results showed a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes in moderate-to-severe compared to mild COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The analysis of log2 folds change has a statistically significant increase observed in the expression of coagulation genes and a significant difference in the expression of coagulation genes among moderate-to-severe and mild patients, as well as healthy controls. The results underscored the impact of COVID-19 infection on the activity of coagulation cascade genes, which could influence the condition of patients and serve as a reference for therapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2, which originated in China in late 2019, quickly fueled the global COVID‐19 pandemic, profoundly impacting health and the economy worldwide. A series of vaccines, mostly based on the full SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein, were rapidly developed, showing excellent humoral and cellular responses and high efficacy against both symptomatic infection and severe disease. However, viral evolution and the waning humoral neutralizing responses strongly challenged vaccine long term effectiveness, mainly against symptomatic infection, making necessary a strategy of repeated and updated booster shots. In this repeated vaccination context, antibody repertoire diversification was evidenced, although immune imprinting after booster doses or reinfection was also demonstrated and identified as a major determinant of immunological responses to repeated antigen exposures. Considering that a small domain of the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein, the receptor binding domain (RBD), is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and concentrates most viral mutations, the following text aims to provide insights into the ongoing debate over the best strategies for vaccine boosters. We address the relevance of developing new booster vaccines that target the evolving RBD, thus focusing on the relevant antigenic sites of the SARS‐CoV‐2 new variants. A combination of this strategy with immunofusing and computerized approaches could minimize immune imprinting, therefore optimizing neutralizing immune responses and booster vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Introduction COVID-19 was less severe in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared with Europe and North America. It is unclear whether these differences could be explained immunologically. Here we determined the levels of ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 peptide-specific IFN-{gamma} producing cells, and levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines over the first month of COVID-19 diagnosis among Kenyan COVID-19 patients from urban and rural areas. Methods Between June 2020 and August 2022, we recruited and longitudinally monitored 188 COVID-19 patients from two regions in Kenya, Nairobi (urban, n = 152) and Kilifi (rural, n = 36), with varying levels of disease severity {-}- severe, mild/moderate, and asymptomatic. IFN-{gamma} secreting cells were enumerated at 0-, 7-, 14- and 28-days post diagnosis by an ex vivo enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay following in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with overlapping peptides from several SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A multiplexed binding assay was used to measure the levels of 22 plasma cytokines and chemokines. Results Higher frequencies of IFN-{gamma}-secreting cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides were observed on the day of diagnosis among the asymptomatic compared to the patients with severe COVID-19. Higher concentrations of 17 of the 22 cytokines and chemokines measured were positively associated with severe disease, and in particular interleukin (IL)-8, IL-18 and IL-1ra (p<0.0001), while a lower concentration of SDF-1 was associated with severe disease (p<0.0001). Concentrations of 8 and 16 cytokines and chemokines including IL-18 were higher among Nairobi asymptomatic and mild patients compared to their respective Kilifi counterparts. Conversely, the concentrations for SDF-1 were higher in rural Kilifi compared to Nairobi (p=0.012). Conclusion In Kenya, as seen elsewhere, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were associated with severe COVID-19, while an early IFN-{gamma} cellular response to overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides was associated with reduced risk of disease. Living in urban Nairobi (compared with rural Kilifi) was associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The pathogenesis of Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) following mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. In particular, the involvement of activated mast cells (MC) in the highly angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing small bowel, the largest lymphoid organ, might be significant in PCS pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of activated MC, residual SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and zonulin (a marker for impaired intestinal integrity), in the context of PCS, examining peripheral blood (PB) and terminal ileum (TI) 2 years post-infection. Methods In this cross-sectional, controlled study, paired PB and TI samples were obtained from 21 SARS-CoV-2 convalescents with (PCS+) and 11 without PCS (PCS−). CD117+CD25+ activated MC and residual S protein were assessed using fluorescent immunohistochemistry on sections of the the ileal tissue from the gut. Tryptase, zonulin and S protein were quantified in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry assessed frequencies of T-cells (CD3+CD4+ (TCD4), CD3+CD8+ T-cells (TCD8)) and CCR7±CD27± memory subsets (TCM: T central memory, TEM: T effector memory) on mononuclear cells of PB and TI. Results Among PCS+ and PCS−, median follow up was 22 and 18 months post-infection, 81% and 73% were female, and 57% and 55% had pre-existing conditions of which arterial hypertension, chronic lung disease and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent. Compared to PCS−, PCS+ expressed significantly more MC (p< 0.0001) in ileal sections, along with elevated levels of tryptase (p=0.0196) and zonulin (p=0.024) in PB. S protein, by contrast, was undetectable in PB of PCS+ and PCS− even 2 years post-infection. In TI however, the frequency of tissue-resident S protein-infected cells was significantly higher in PCS+ compared to PCS− (p=0.0135). Interestingly, systemic tryptase levels correlated positively to elevated TCM in TI (r=0.7407, p=0.0034). Conclusion Elevated MC activity and S protein in the TI, along with increased tryptase and zonulin levels in PB, indicate ongoing immune activation and intestinal damage in the TI of PCS+. Understanding the role of tissue-resident MC in PCS pathogenesis could lead to targeted therapies. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a respiratory disease that can range in presentation from mild symptoms to severe conditions such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus, spreads through aerosols and respiratory droplets. It enters human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, leading to various complications, including significant alterations in red blood cells and potential disruptions in haemoglobin function and oxygen transport. During infection, the interaction between hypoxia, inflammation, and haematopoiesis affects erythropoiesis at multiple levels. Hypoxia and inflammation, resulting from lung complications and a reduced red blood cell count, influence the regulation of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron levels in the blood. Elevated hepcidin levels are associated with hypoxia and the suppression of erythroferrone, a hormone that normally inhibits hepcidin production. Despite high levels of inflammation, patients in intensive care units often exhibit elevated ferritin levels, which, rather than indicating low hepcidin, suggest disrupted iron metabolism and the development of severe anaemia. Iron is kept in stores, likely due to paradoxically high hepcidin levels, which explains the elevated ferritin measurements. An increase in immature blood cells and a decrease in CD71+ erythroid cells are observed. The elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells highlight their dual role in modulating hyper-inflammation and immune response during disease progression. This review examines the pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 affects red blood cell production and the haematopoietic system and how it triggers cytokine storms through interleukins, immature blood cells, and CD71+ erythroid cells. Understanding these processes provides novel pathways for managing haematological manifestations and immune responses in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Microglia play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and display remarkable plasticity in their response to inflammatory stimuli. However, the specific signaling profiles that microglia adopt during such challenges remain incompletely understood. Traditional transcriptomic approaches provide valuable insights, but fail to capture dynamic post-translational changes. In this study, we utilized time-resolved single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to measure distinct signaling pathways activated in microglia upon exposure to bacterial and viral mimetics-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the immunomodulatory role of astrocytes on microglial signaling in mixed cultures. Microglia or mixed cultures derived from neonatal mice were treated with LPS or Poly(I:C) for 48 h. Cultures were stained with a panel of 33 metal-conjugated antibodies targeting signaling and identity markers. High-dimensional clustering analysis was used to identify emergent signaling modules. We found that LPS treatment led to more robust early activation of pp38, pERK, pRSK, and pCREB compared to Poly(I:C). Despite these differences, both LPS and Poly(I:C) upregulated the classical reactivity markers CD40 and CD86 at later time points. Strikingly, the presence of astrocytes significantly blunted microglial responses to both stimuli, particularly dampening CD40 upregulation. Our studies demonstrate that single-cell mass cytometry effectively captures the dynamic signaling landscape of microglia under pro-inflammatory conditions. This approach may pave the way for targeted therapeutic investigations of various neuroinflammatory disorders. Moreover, our findings underscore the necessity of considering cellular context, such as astrocyte presence, in interpreting microglial behavior during inflammation.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has presented formidable challenges to global health since its emergence in late 2019. While primarily known for respiratory symptoms, it can also affect the ocular surface. This review summarizes the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on ocular surface immunity and inflammation, focusing on infection mechanisms, immune responses, and clinical manifestations. Ocular symptoms, though uncommon, include conjunctivitis, dry eye, and blurred vision. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in ocular surface epithelial cells, facilitating viral entry, replication, and local dissemination. The innate immune responses involving corneal epithelial cells and immune cells are discussed, alongside mechanisms of antigen presentation and adaptive immunity. The review also examines the roles of cytokines and chemokines in mediating ocular surface inflammation and explores the impact of cytokine storms and chronic inflammation on ocular health. Additionally, the interplay between systemic and ocular immune responses is highlighted, analyzing how systemic COVID-19 inflammation influences ocular surface health. These insights underscore the broader implications of COVID-19 beyond localized ocular infection. By consolidating current findings, this review aims to guide preventive and therapeutic strategies while identifying directions for future research to mitigate the ocular consequences of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), exhibits a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pulmonary dysfunction or death. The variability in COVID-19 severity has largely been attributed to the host’s genetic characteristics, suggesting a polygenic genetic architecture, without significant strong evidence of sex-related genetic differences. In this Italian retrospective case–control study, we investigated the association between COVID-19 severity (severe vs. asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic healed individuals) and HLA gene variants, analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). We identified significant HLA alleles (according to the conventional nomenclature), SNPs and haplotypes in the HLA-B, -C, -F, -DQA1, -DRB1, and -DRB5 genes associated with COVID-19 severity. Interestingly, these variants showed biological sex-related effects. Also, we identified specific haplotypes associated with COVID-19 severity that are shared by different conventional HLA alleles, indicated here as “super-haplotypes”. These haplotypes had a biological sex-specific impact on disease severity and markedly increased the risk of severe COVID-19 compared to the conventional HLA alleles (odds ratio of up to 15). Our data suggest that the revision of the current HLA nomenclature may help to identify variants with a stronger effect on disease susceptibility and that association studies could benefit from the stratification of patients by biological sex. If replicated in other disease models, these findings could help to define the functional diversity in immune response between sexes, also based on the HLA system. Finally, due to the global pandemic’s mortality rate, we hypothesize here that SARS-CoV-2 may have acted as a natural selection trigger, leading to a drift in HLA allelic frequencies in the general population.">

        <tr id="Oligodendroglia are the responsible cells for myelination in the central nervous system and their involvement in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is poorly understood. We performed snRNA-seq and image-based spatial transcriptomics of human caudate nucleus and putamen (dorsal striatum) from PD and Control brain donors to elucidate the diversity of oligodendroglia and how they are affected by the disease. We have defined fifteen subclasses, from precursor to mature cells, four of which are disease-associated. These PD-specific populations are characterized by the overexpression of heat shock proteins and distinct expression signatures, including immune responses and myelination alterations. We have also identified disruptions in cell communication and oligodendrocyte development, evidenced by changes in neurotransmitter receptors expression and cell adhesion molecules. These transcriptomic changes correlated with impaired myelin integrity and altered oligodendrocyte distribution in the striatum. Thus, we uncover oligodendroglia as a critical cell type in PD and a potential new therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="From December 2019 to March 2020, the human population faced a new coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, which led to global morbidity and high mortality worldwide. Typical features of coronavirus infection tended to resemble a seasonal infection over time. Despite this fact, it has been proven that, after acute disease, numerous disorders are detected in the patients, manifesting both with general health disturbances and as complications of pre-existing chronic diseases, including allergic syndrome. On the basis of these findings, the study of post-COVID syndrome became an important aspect of the ongoing COVID-19 research. It has been shown over recent decades that the number of people suffering from various types of allergic reactions is growing every year. Therefore, the studies in allergic pathology in the structure of post-COVID syndrome are among the most pressing issues. In addition to studying exacerbations of allergic reactions, a thorough analysis has shown that adverse reactions caused by coronavirus infection are viewed from new aspects, being characterized by functional disorders of acquired and innate immune response, causing increasingly severe consequences for the immune system and the whole body. Currently, the features of humoral immune response in post-COVID syndrome have not been sufficiently studied. In this respect, we have evaluated the features of humoral immunity in patients with post-COVID syndrome, with clinically confirmed allergic anamnesis. The study revealed changes in humoral immune system, indicating that the most significant changes are observed in post-COVID patients with a burdened history of allergies, thus requiring a more detailed study of immune status in order to develop an individualized approach to immunocorrection of these disorders in this group of patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting from an abnormal immune response to normal stimuli, such as food and intestinal flora. Since the etiology of this disease remains largely unknown, murine models induced by the consumption of dextran-sodium sulfate serve as a pivotal tool for studying colon inflammation. In this study, we employed both acute and chronic colitis mouse models induced by varying durations of dextran-sodium sulfate consumption to investigate the pathological and immunologic characteristics throughout the disease course. During the acute phase, activated innate inflammation marked by M1 macrophage infiltration was prominent. In contrast, the chronic phase was characterized by tissue remodeling, with a significant increase in M2 macrophages and lymphocytes. RNA-sequencing revealed genetic changes in acute and chronic colitis, marked by the maintenance of genomic integrity in the acute phase and extracellular matrix dynamics in the chronic phase. These phase-specific alterations reflect the multifaceted physiological processes involved in the initiation and progression of inflammation in the large intestine, underscoring the necessity for distinct experimental approaches for each phase. The findings demonstrate that the factors shaping the large intestinal immune microenvironment change specifically during the acute and chronic phases of experimental inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting the importance of developing therapeutic strategies that align with the disease course.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is associated with respiratory disease in children. Between 2014 and 2018, biennial EV-D68 outbreaks coincided with peaks of a polio-like neurologic condition called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). We hypothesized that specific mutations within the currently circulating B3 clade of EV-D68 impacted neurovirulence. However, recovery of these strains from infectious clones by published methods proved unsuccessful. Therefore, we tested different cell lines, reagents, and conditions to enhance efficiency of recombinant (r)EV-D68 rescue. In this study, we present a tractable rescue system to define virulence determinants in B3 clade strains. Using this approach, we successfully rescued historic and contemporary rEV-D68 strains to high titer after limited cell culture passage. All strains in our study replicated efficiently in the parental RD cell line and in human respiratory epithelial cell lines, with BEAS-2B cells exhibiting greater permissivity than A549 cells. While B2 and B3 clade strains could infect the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, the neurovirulent B2 clade strain rUSA/IL/2014-18952 was more dependent on neuron differentiation than B3 clade strains and replication was not sustained under multi-cycle growth conditions. Conversely, replication of rUSA/IL/2014-18952 was more efficient in human spinal cord organoids, which model the cellular heterogeneity of the spinal cord, while replication of B3 clade strains was more modest. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed infection, with viral antigen colocalized with neurons. These findings suggest shifting dynamics of EV-D68 neurovirulence and provide a critical platform for further assessment of viral determinants of neurovirulence in B3 clade strains. IMPORTANCE Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) can cause acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a debilitating neurological condition of the spinal cord in children. Identifying viral determinants of EV- D68 neuropathogenesis is critical to understanding recent shifts in AFM prevalence; however, these investigations are limited to a small subset of infectious clones distantly related to currently circulating B3 clade strains. In this study, we leverage improved rescue strategies to characterize recombinant (r)EV-D68 strains from the dominant B3 clade. While all rEV-D68 replicate efficiently in the parental cell line and in human respiratory epithelial cells, B3 clade strains achieved greater titers in cultured neurons than a neurovirulent B2 clade strain, with less dependence on neuronal differentiation state. All B3 clade strains established infection in human spinal cord organoids, but replication varied between strains. Therefore, our study presents a tractable rescue system to begin to dissect viral determinants of shifting neurotropism within contemporary EV-D68 clades.">

These symptoms, which include chronic fatigue, respiratory distress, cognitive dysfunction, and other multisystem effects, significantly impact the quality of life of the affected individuals. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood, although studies have suggested a multifactorial origin. Proposed factors include viral persistence, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation disturbances, and gut dysbiosis. The identification of these mechanisms could facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, opening new perspectives for the effective management of persistent Covid. The diagnosis of PC is complex due to the diversity of symptoms and the lack of specific biomarkers. At present, therapeutic approaches focus primarily on symptomatic relief, but further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying PC and to develop targeted interventions.

The predictive role of gut microbiome composition during acute infection in the development of LC is not well understood, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of disease. We conducted a longitudinal study of 799 outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 (380 positive, 419 negative) and found that individuals who later developed LC harbored distinct gut microbiome compositions during acute infection, compared with both SARS-CoV-2–positive individuals who did not develop LC and negative controls with similar symptomatology. However, the temporal changes in gut microbiome composition between the infectious (0–1 month) and post-infectious (1–2 months) phases was not different between study groups. Using machine learning, we showed that microbiome composition alone more accurately predicted LC than clinical variables. Including clinical data only marginally enhanced this prediction, suggesting that microbiome profiles during acute infection may reflect underlying health status and immune responses thus, help predicting individuals at risk for LC. Finally, we identified four LC symptom clusters, with gastrointestinal and fatigue-only groups most strongly linked to gut microbiome alterations.">

In addition to its high infectivity and pathogenicity and its rapid mutation rate, the unique capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to circumvent the immune system has also contributed to the widespread nature of this pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 elicits the onset of innate immune system activation and initiates antiviral responses once it has infected the host. While battling the host’s immune responses, SARS-CoV-2 has established many countermeasures to evade attack and clearance. As the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 continues, substantial evidence has revealed that the 29 proteins synthesized by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are integral to the viral infection process. They not only facilitate viral replication and transmission, but also assist SARS-CoV-2 in escaping the host’s immune defenses, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets that have attracted considerable attention in recent studies. This review summarizes the manner in which SARS-CoV-2 interfaces with the innate immune system, with a particular focus on the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications of mutations.">

IPF patients without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 had undetectable levels of anti-N IgG antibodies, highlighting their lack of previous infection. After vaccination, IPF patients showed a significant increase in anti-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies, though their levels were lower compared to healthy controls and convalescent IPF patients. Additionally, IPF patients exhibited altered proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T lymphocytes (Teffs) before and after vaccination. Specifically, IPF patients had higher percentages of Tregs with a Th2 phenotype and Th17 Tregs, along with reduced proportions of Th1/17 Tregs. Teffs in IPF patients showed a decrease in Th1-like and Th2-like populations after vaccination. Moreover, IPF patients demonstrated elevated populations of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc) before vaccination and increased levels of γδ Tc cells throughout the study. Alterations in cytokine profiles were also observed, IPF patients showed higher levels of IL-6 and IL-22 compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest a distinct immune response in IPF patients to the COVID-19 vaccine, characterized by differences in antibody production, T cell differentiation and cytokine secretion compared to healthy individuals.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses cause nearly 1 billion global infections annually and are associated with a diverse array of human illnesses. Among these, myocarditis and the resulting chronic inflammation have been recognized as major contributing factors to virus-induced heart failure. Despite our growing understanding, very limited therapeutic strategies have been developed to address the pathological consequences of virus-induced chronic innate immune activation. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was used as a model cardiotropic enterovirus. We leveraged in vitro cell-based studies to investigate cardiomyocyte and macrophage interaction during CVB3 infection, as well as animal studies and unique human cardio specimens to evaluate mechanisms of viral heart injury. We present evidence that viral myocarditis is in part exacerbated by pathological activation of the complement pathway in cells, mice, and human cardiac tissues. We demonstrate unique cell type-specific responses to viral infection that are exacerbated by mitochondrial injury in cardiomyocytes and NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in macrophages. Macrophages are robustly activated by damage-associated mitochondrial components, including mitochondrial proteins and lipid extracts. Mechanistically, we identify complement protective factors CD59/protectin and CD55/DAF as novel targets of viral proteinase that acts to release the brakes on complement-mediated autoinjury. Collectively, our study highlights a novel mechanism that can act as a potential contributor to CVB3 pathogenesis through mitochondrial injury-mediated autoimmunity.


IMPORTANCE
This study sheds light on how enteroviruses, specifically coxsackievirus B3, may contribute to heart failure by triggering harmful immune responses in the heart. We discovered that viral infections in heart cells cause mitochondrial damage, which in turn activates a destructive immune response involving the complement system. This immune activation is one of the significant contributors that lead to further injury of heart tissues, worsening the damage caused by the virus. Additionally, we identified key protective molecules that are targeted and disrupted by the virus, allowing the immune system to attack the heart even more aggressively. Understanding these mechanisms may provide additional insights into how viral infections can lead to chronic heart conditions and suggests potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reduce heart damage in patients affected by viral myocarditis.">

        <tr id="Background Atherosclerosis involves complex interactions between lipids, immune cells, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and fibroblasts within the arterial wall. While significant advances in single-cell technologies have shed light on the roles of immune cells and VSMCs in plaque development, fibroblasts remain underexplored, leaving critical gaps in understanding their contributions to disease progression and plaque stability. Comprehensive characterization of fibroblast phenotypes in atherosclerosis is essential to unravel their diverse functions and to distinguish between subsets that may play protective versus pathogenic roles in the disease process. Methods Here, we utilized CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing) to comprehensively profile fibroblast diversity in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 0, 8, 19, and 26 weeks, representing distinct stages of disease progression, enabling a detailed phenotypic characterization of fibroblasts throughout the course of atherosclerosis development. Results We identified four distinct fibroblast subpopulations, including a myofibroblast population closely resembling VSMC-derived chondromyocytes. The proportions of these fibroblast subsets exhibited a modest decline as atherosclerosis progressed. Through multimodal analysis, we identified CD26 as a highly expressed and specific marker for one of these fibroblast subpopulations, distinguishing it from other subsets. Using a combination of flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that CD26+ fibroblasts predominantly reside in the adventitia of healthy arteries. During atherosclerosis progression, these cells expand into the intima and primarily localize within the fibrous cap of the lesion. Conclusions Our multi-omic analysis highlights the phenotypic diversity and dynamic changes of fibroblasts during atherosclerosis progression. Among these, CD26+ fibroblasts emerge as a distinct subpopulation that expands within atherosclerotic lesions and may play a critical role in promoting plaque stability through their migration into the fibrous cap.">

        <tr id="Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making them a significant public health concern. During infection, respiratory viruses, including Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), trigger an antiviral immune response, specifically boosting the inflammatory response that plays a critical role in their pathogenesis. The inflammatory response induced by respiratory viruses can be a double-edged sword since it can be initially induced to be antiviral and protective/reparative from virus-induced injuries. Still, it can also be detrimental to host cells and tissues. However, the mechanisms that differentiate the complex crosstalk between favorable host inflammatory responses and harmful inflammatory responses are poorly understood. This review explores the complex interplay between viral pathogens and the host immune response, mainly focusing on the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of VRIs. We discuss how inflammation can both contain and exacerbate the progression of viral infections, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and emerging drugs for modulating the aberrant inflammatory responses during VRIs.">

        <tr id="The role of immune cells in neurodegeneration remains incompletely understood. Our recent study revealed the presence of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in the meninges, where they express antioxidant molecules to maintain meningeal barrier integrity. Accumulation of misfolded tau proteins are a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. The role of MAIT cells in tau-related neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, however, remains unclear. Here we report that the meninges of P301 mutant human tau transgenic mice had increased numbers of MAIT cells, which retained their expression of antioxidant molecules. Mr1-/-P301S mice that lacked MAIT cells exhibited increased tau pathology and hippocampus atrophy compared to control Mr1+/+ P301S mice. Adoptive transfer of MAIT cells reduced tau pathology and hippocampus atrophy in Mr1-/- P301S mice. Meningeal barrier integrity was compromised in Mr/-/-P301S mice, but not in control Mr1+/+ P301S mice. A distinctive microglia subset with proinflammatory gene expression profile (M-inflammatory) was enriched in the hippocampus of Mr1-/- P301S mice. The transcriptomes of the remaining microglia in these mice also shifted towards a proinflammatory state, with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and genes related with ribosome biogenesis and immune responses to toxic substances. The transfer of MAIT cells restored meningeal barrier integrity and suppressed microglial inflammation in the Mr1-/- P301S mice. Together, our data indicate an important role for MAIT cells in regulating tau-pathology-related neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Oligodendrocytes (OL) and their myelin-forming processes are targeted and lost during the disease course of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), targeted by infiltrating leukocytes and their effector cytokines. Myelin repair is considered to be dependent on recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The basis of failure of re-myelination during the disease course of MS remains to be defined. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of pro-inflammatory molecules tumor necrosis factor ⍰ (TNF⍰) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) on the differentiation of human OPCs. Methods We generated human OPCs from induced pluripotent stem cells with a reporter gene under the OL-specific transcription factor SOX10. We treated the cells in vitro with TNF⍰ or IFNγ and evaluated effects in terms of cell viability, expression of OL-lineage markers, and co- expression of astrocyte markers. To relate our findings to the molecular properties of OPCs as found in the MS brain we re-analyzed publicly available single nuclear RNAseq datasets. Results Our analysis indicated that both TNF⍰ and IFNγ decreased the proportion of cells differentiating into the OL-lineage; consistent with previous reports. We now observe the TNF⍰ effect is linked to aberrant OPC differentiation. A subset of O4+, reporter-positive cells co- expressed the astrocytic marker Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). On the transcriptomic level, the cells acquire an astrocyte-like signature alongside a conserved reactive phenotype. Analysis of single- nuclear RNAseq datasets from human MS brain revealed a subset of OPCs expressing an astrocytic signature. Discussion In the context of MS, these results imply that OPCs are present but inhibited from differentiating along the OL-lineage, with a subset acquiring a reactive and stem-cell like phenotype, reducing their capacity to contribute towards repair. These findings help define a potential basis for the impaired myelin repair in MS and provide a prospective route for regenerative treatment.">

However, the molecular mechanism for the increased mortality in cancer patients infected with COVID-19 is unclear. Methods Colony formation and wound healing assays were performed on Huh-7 cells cocultured with syncytia. Exosomes were purified from the cell supernatant and verified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Western blot (WB) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Differentially expressed proteins in syncytia-derived exosomes (Syn-Exos) and their functions was analyzed by Proteomic sequencing. Syn-Exo-mediated promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was measured by CCK-8 and Transwell migration assays. The mechanism by which Syn-Exos promote tumor growth was analyzed by Western blotting. A patient-derived xenotransplantation (PDX) mouse model was constructed to evaluate the pathological role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2-S). The number of syncytia in the tumor tissue sections was determined by immunofluorescence analysis. Results Syncytium formation promoted the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Proteomic sequencing revealed that proteins that regulate cell proliferation and metastasis in Syn-Exos were significantly upregulated. Syn-Exos promote the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Animal experiments showed that a pseudotyped lentivirus bearing SARS-2-S (SARS-2-Spp) promoted tumor development in PDX mice. More syncytia were found in tumor tissue from SARS-2-Spp mice than from VSV-Gpp mice. Conclusions Syn-Exos induced by SARS-2-S can promote the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.">

        <tr id="CNS-resident microglia and recruited myeloid cells populate the haematoma in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), but the contribution of these cell populations to injury and repair has been controversial. To better characterise myeloid cell changes over time, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a unique paired dataset of live haematoma and peripheral blood samples from 10 ICH patients. This work presents a temporal atlas of ICH myeloid populations and identifies population-specific in-situ transcriptional drivers. In addition to distinct populations of activated microglia and TNF-low microglia, we found a unique and highly activated population of CD14+ monocytes in the haematoma. Perturbation analysis comparing haematoma-associated monocytes to shared populations in blood and haematomas identified TNF signalling as the primary driver of their activation. Employing a custom temporal trajectory analysis based on the embeddings of a single-cell foundation model, we found that this TNF response in monocytes was transient, peaking early after haemorrhage and decreasing over the ensuing 48 hours. Our analysis further identified a transient population of highly activated microglia as the likely source of TNF during the acute stage of ICH. Acute TNF signalling in CD14+ monocytes associated with better adjusted outcomes both in our and external cohorts. Overall, our results suggest that acute TNF signalling between transient populations of activated microglia and unique haematoma-associated monocytes could potentially be beneficial in recovery after ICH.

        <tr id="Cytokine storm syndromes (CSS) are characterized by an excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction. Initially recognized in severe viral infections, such as those caused by SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1, CSS have also been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. This review explores the pathophysiology of CSS, highlighting the critical roles of key cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in driving hyper-inflammatory responses. We discuss the triggers of cytokine storms, including viral infections, autoimmune dysregulation, genetic predispositions, and therapeutic agents. Clinical manifestations can range from mild symptoms to severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. Early recognition and intervention are vital for improving outcomes. Management strategies focus on mitigating inflammation through corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. As research advances, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying cytokine storm syndromes will pave the way for innovative therapeutic approaches, enhancing patient care in these critical and complex conditions.

        <tr id="Introduction Remyelination of demyelinated axons can occur as an endogenous repair mechanism in multiple sclerosis (MS), but its efficacy varies between both MS individuals and lesions. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive remyelination remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the relation between microglia activation and remyelination activity in MS. Methods We correlated regenerative (CD163+) and inflammatory (iNOS+) microglia with BCAS1+ oligodendrocytes, subdivided into early-stage (<3 processes) and late-stage (≥3 processes) cells in brain donors with high or low remyelinating potential in remyelinated lesions and active lesions with ramified/amoeboid (non-foamy) or foamy microglia. A cohort of MS donors categorized as efficiently remyelinating donors (ERDs; n=25) or poorly remyelinating donors (PRDs; n=17) was included, based on their proportion of remyelinated lesions at autopsy. Results and discussion We hypothesized more CD163+ microglia and BCAS1+ oligodendrocytes in remyelinated and active non-foamy lesions from ERDs and more iNOS+ microglia with fewer BCAS1+ oligodendrocytes in active foamy lesions from PRDs. For CD163+ microglia, however, no differences were observed between MS lesions and MS donor groups. In line with our hypothesis, we found that INOS+ microglia were significantly increased in PRDs compared to ERDs within remyelinated lesions. MS lesions, more late-stage BCAS1+ oligodendrocytes were detected in active lesions with non-foamy or foamy microglia in comparison with remyelinated lesions. Although no differences were found for early-stage BCAS1+ oligodendrocytes between MS lesions, we did find significantly more early-stage BCAS1+ oligodendrocytes in PRDs vs ERDs in remyelinated lesions. Interestingly, a positive correlation was identified between iNOS+ microglia and the presence of early-stage BCAS1+ oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest that impaired maturation of early-stage BCAS1+ oligodendrocytes, encountering inflammatory microglia, may underlie remyelination deficits and unsuccessful lesion repair in MS.">

 Proinflammatory cytokines significantly contribute to the initiation and propagation of inflammation and to impaired functional recovery in neuroinflammatory diseases. We identified that microglia express and secrete interferon alpha-inducible protein 27 like 2A (Ifi27l2a) in response to inflammatory signals. However, the functional role of Ifi27l2a in inflammation has not been well defined. Through a combination of cell culture and
 in vivo
 mouse models, we now demonstrate that Ifi27l2a acts as a novel hub protein that regulates proinflammatory responses in microglia.


 Methods:
 Endotoxemia was induced by LPS administration in aged mice to determine the subsequent circulating Ifi27l2a protein levels in the plasma. Sim-A9 cells and primary microglia were stimulated with recombinant Ifi27l2a (rIfi27l2a) at concentrations of 10 and 100 ng/ml to investigate whether Ifi27l2a promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and conversion of microglial phenotype. RNA-seq was performed on primary microglia to define transcriptional changes induced by Ifi27l2a as well as alterations in cellular signaling associated with proinflammatory microglia.


 Results:
 Systemic injection of LPS increased circulating Ifi27l2a protein levels in the plasma of aged mice (
 Veh:
 38.1,
 LPS:
 122.1 pg/ml, n=4-5, p<0.05). To investigate how exogenous Ifi27l2a modulates microglial phenotypic changes, we treated microglia to rIfi27l2a. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were elevated by rIfi27l2a treatment in both Sim-A9 and primary microglia (n=6-8, p<0.05). Notably, treatment with rIfi27l2a increased the ATP production, which LPS did not, as assessed by Seahorse cell analysis (n=10-21, p<0.05). In addition, inflammation marker genes (
 Il1b
 ,
 Tnfa
 , and
 Mmp9
 ) were significantly elevated in rIfi27l2a-treated microglia compared to the control. Transcriptional analysis of rIfi27l2a treatment with RNA-seq (n=5) revealed that a set of proinflammatory genes, including
 Mmps
 , were highly upregulated. The data also showed that microglial phagocytosis-related genes and disease-associated microglia (DAM)-related genes were suppressed by rIfi27l2a.


 Conclusions:
 These data suggest a novel role for Ifi27l2a in brain inflammation through the shifting of microglia toward a proinflammatory phenotype and away from the reparative DAM phenotype. We propose that selective disruption of Ifi27l2a signaling may provide a new therapeutic strategy to reduce harmful inflammation and improve functional outcome following stroke.

        <tr id="The pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is characterized by a complex of interactions within viral factors, abnormal haemostasis, dysfunction of endothelial cells, and inflammatory reactions, necessitating the research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. Severe COVID-19 conditions are frequently coupled with an increased immunological response, dubbed a cytokine storm, which facilitates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha). The cytokine storm contributes to widespread inflammation and endothelial activation, disrupting the balance between pro-coagulant and anticoagulant factors. Additionally, it is capable of being transmitted by contacting surfaces that are contaminated and then rubbing the face. Biomarkers such as D-dimer levels serve as valuable tools in risk assessment and monitoring, yet their interpretation requires careful consideration within the clinical context. Although some COVID-19 patients may not exhibit any symptoms, they can still spread the virus to others, and there is proof that the virus can spread via the air in some environments, especially confined areas with inadequate ventilation. Vaccines have been developed and deployed globally to prevent COVID-19 infection and reduce severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. Governments and health authorities worldwide have implemented policies including lockdowns, social isolation, mask-wearing, investigation, contact tracking, and vaccination campaigns to control transmission and reduce the impact of the virus.

        <tr id="Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), marked by inflammation, demyelination, and significant oligodendrocyte injury. This disease arises from a complex interplay of genetic predispositions and environmental triggers that drive immune-mediated damage to oligodendrocytes and myelin proteins. 
This research paper explores the multifaceted aspects of oligodendrocyte injury in MS, ranging from underlying pathophysiological mechanisms to potential therapeutic interventions and translational implications for clinical practice. 
Oligodendrocyte damage in MS occurs via multiple mechanisms, including metabolic stress, oxidative damage, and cytokine-induced apoptosis, mainly mediated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling. This process exacerbates neuroinflammation and contributes to disease progression. Emerging therapeutic strategies, such as targeting metabolic pathways, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing autophagy, have demonstrated potential in preclinical studies. Furthermore, stem cell therapies are being explored for their ability to regenerate oligodendrocytes and restore myelin integrity. 
Conclusions: The intricate interplay among oligodendrocyte injury, demyelination, and neuroinflammation is central to multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Oligodendrocytes safeguard myelin in the CNS, facing challenges from immune attacks to metabolic stress. Understanding oligodendrocyte dysfunction is vital for targeted therapies that suppress immune damage and promote remyelination and CNS repair. MS's etiology,">

        <tr id="In multiple sclerosis (MS), microglia and macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in determining the balance among demyelination, neurodegeneration, and myelin repair. Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the lack of therapies aimed at promoting remyelination and slowing disease progression for individuals with MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, shifts the transcriptional programs of microglia and CNS-associated macrophages from a proinflammatory phenotype to a regenerative phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 stimulated scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that prevented the activation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes while also promoting neuroaxonal health and oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment of mice with bryo-1 augmented remyelination after a focal demyelinating injury. Our results demonstrate the potential of bryo-1 and possibly a wider class of PKC modulators as myelin-regenerative and supportive agents in MS and other neurologic diseases.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can lead to a variety of clinical outcomes, including severe congenital abnormalities. The phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors AXL and TIM-1 are recognized as critical entry factors for ZIKV in vitro. However, it remains unclear if and how ZIKV regulates these receptors during infection. In this study, we investigated AXL and TIM-1 expression in human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells, glioblastoma U87 cells, and embryonic stem cells-derived trophoblast following ZIKV infection. We found that both the Asian strain FSS13025 and the African strain MR766 of ZIKV downregulate AXL, with a milder effect on TIM-1. We identified several ZIKV proteins, notably envelope (E), NS2A, NS3, and NS4B, that contribute to this downregulation. Notably, treatment with lysosomal inhibitor NH4Cl or the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) mitigated the AXL/TIM-1 downregulation, indicating autophagy’s involvement in the process. Importantly, this downregulation facilitates sustained viral replication and promotes viral spread by preventing superinfection and limiting cell death, which is also associated with impaired innate immune signaling. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which ZIKV downregulates entry factors to enhance prolonged viral replication and spread. AUTHOR SUMMARY Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with severe birth defects, yet the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors AXL and TIM-1 and discovered that they promote ZIKV entry but are downregulated by the virus infection. We identified several ZIKV proteins involved in AXL and TIM-1 down-regulation through an autophagy-mediated process. Mechanistically, this loss of surface receptors protects host cells from superinfection and cell death, while dampening the innate immune response, ultimately promoting viral spread. Our results contribute to a better understanding of ZIKV’s interactions with host cells and offer insight into viral entry, innate signaling, and pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of long COVID (LC) still presents many areas of uncertainty. This leads to difficulties in finding an effective specific therapy. We hypothesize that the key to LC pathogenesis lies in the presence of chronic functional damage to the main anti-inflammatory mechanisms of our body: the three reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis, and the mitochondrial redox status. We will illustrate that this neuro-endocrine-metabolic axis is closely interconnected and how the SARS-CoV-2 can damage it at all stages through direct, immune-inflammatory, epigenetic damage mechanisms, as well as through the reactivation of neurotropic viruses. According to our theory, the direct mitochondrial damage carried out by the virus, which replicates within these organelles, and the cellular oxidative imbalance, cannot be countered in patients who develop LC. This is because their anti-inflammatory mechanisms are inconsistent due to reduced vagal tone and direct damage to the endocrine glands of the HPA axis. We will illustrate how acetylcholine (ACh) and cortisol, with its cytoplasmatic and cellular receptors respectively, are fundamental players in the LC process. Both Ach and cortisol play multifaceted and synergistic roles in reducing inflammation. They achieve this by modulating the activity of innate and cell-mediated immunity, attenuating endothelial and platelet activation, and modulating mitochondrial function, which is crucial for cellular energy production and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In our opinion, it is essential to study the sensitivity of the glucocorticoids receptor in people who develop LC and whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause long-term epigenetic variations in its expression and function.">

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="It is becoming more broadly accepted that human-based models are needed to better understand the complexities of the human nervous system and its diseases. The recently developed human brain organotypic culture model is one highly promising model that requires the involvement of neurosurgeons and neurosurgical patients. Studies have investigated the electrophysiological properties of neurons in such ex vivo human tissues, but the maintenance of other cell types within explanted brain remains largely unknown. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we systematically evaluate the transcriptional identities of the various cell types found in six patient samples after fourteen days in culture (83,501 nuclei from day 0 samples and 45,738 nuclei from day 14 samples). We used two pediatric temporal lobectomy samples, an adult frontal cortex sample, two IDH wild-type glioblastoma samples, and one medulloblastoma sample. We found remarkably high correlations of day 14 transcriptional identities to day 0 tissue, especially in tumor cells (r = 0.90 to 0.93), though microglia (r = 0.86), oligodendrocytes (r = 0.80), pericytes (r = 0.77), endothelial cells (r = 0.78), and fibroblasts (r = 0.76) showed strong preservation of their transcriptional profiles as well. Astrocytes and excitatory neurons showed more moderate preservation (r = 0.66 and 0.47, respectively). Because the main difficulty with organotypic brain cultures is the acquisition of human tissue, which is readily available to neurosurgeons, this model is easily accessible to neurosurgeon-scientists and neurosurgeons affiliated with research laboratories. Broad uptake of this more representative model should prompt advances in our understanding of many uniquely human diseases, lead to more reliable clinical trial performance, and ultimately yield better therapies for our patients.">

They sense abnormal ATP release during stress or injury and are considered promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention. However, despite their predominant expression in immune cells such as microglia, there is limited information on P2X7 membrane expression and regulation during inflammation at the single-molecule level, necessitating new labeling approaches to visualize P2X7 in native cells. Here, we present X7-uP, an unbiased, affinity-guided P2X7 chemical labeling reagent that selectively biotinylates endogenous P2X7 in BV2 cells, a murine microglia model, allowing subsequent labeling with streptavidin-Alexa 647 tailored for super-resolution imaging. We uncovered a nanoscale microglial P2X7 redistribution mechanism where evenly spaced individual receptors in quiescent cells undergo upregulation and clustering in response to the pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide and ATP, leading to synergistic interleukin-1β release. Our method thus offers a new approach to revealing endogenous P2X7 expression at the single-molecule level.">

Although, SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals often show no or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Novel CoV-2 infection in 2019 resulted in viral pneumonia as well as other complications and extrapulmonary manifestation. ARDS is also linked to a higher risk of death.

Although SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been responsible for pneumonia,
recent studies indicate that it also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain, among other vital organs.
Evidence suggests that this virus may travel retrogradely from the olfactory epithelium to brain
stem sections, causing neurological impairments in a significant number of individuals. Individuals
with severe COVID-19 frequently have elevated cytokines that promote inflammation and acute
respiratory failure and require frequent supportive ventilation. These factors are believed to contribute
to cognitive deterioration. Severe neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients include- paralysis,
stroke, cranial nerve deficits, delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, and meningitis. The virus, with
its unique structure, and a high binding affinity for the human enzyme ACE2 (used as an entry point
by the virus), contributes significantly to its deadly nature. Furthermore, to address the outbreak effectively,
researchers worldwide must develop precise treatment strategies. Advancing new diagnostic
and treatment methods to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on cognition requires further
epidemiological research and clinical experience. Additionally, by understanding the virus's
impact on cognitive functions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted treatments to alleviate
these severe neurological consequences.

While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID- 19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Rickettsia spp. cause life-threatening diseases in humans. The fundamental pathophysiological changes in fatal rickettsial diseases are disrupted endothelial barrier and increased microvascular permeability. However, it remains largely unclear how rickettsiae induce microvascular endothelial injury. In the present study, we demonstrated that Rickettsia conorii infection disrupts the continuous immunofluorescence expression of the interendothelial tight junction protein, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), in infected monolayers of microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs), accompanied by significantly diminished total expression levels of ZO-1. Interestingly, R. conorii activated inflammasome in MVECs, as evidenced by cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1β in the cell lysates in association with significantly elevated expression levels of nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin containing protein 3 (NLRP3). Furthermore, selective inhibition of NLRP3 by MCC950 significantly suppressed the activation and cleavage of caspase-1 induced by R. conorii in endothelial cells, which further prevented the disruption of interendothelial junctions and reduction of ZO-1 expression. Of note, pharmaceutical inhibition of NLRP3 mitigated the disrupted endothelial integrity caused by R. conorii, measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran passage in a Transwell assay, independent of bacterial growth and cellular cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results suggest that R. conorii affected microvascular endothelial junction integrity likely via diminishing and interrupting the junctional protein ZO-1 in association with activating NLRP3 inflammasome. These data not only highlight the potential of ZO-1 as a biomarker for Rickettsia-induced microvascular injury but also provide insight into targeting NLRP3 inflammasome/ZO-1 signaling as a potentially adjunctive therapeutic approach for severe rickettsioses.">

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) has long been considered an immune-privileged site, where immune responses are tightly regulated to protect neural tissue from inflammation-induced damage. Immune privilege in the CNS is maintained through various mechanisms, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the absence of conventional lymphatic drainage, the specialized function of CNS-resident immune cells, and the expression of immunosuppressive molecules like TGF-β and IL-10. These protective systems are essential for preserving CNS homeostasis, as uncontrolled immune activity in the CNS can lead to irreversible damage to neurons and glial cells. However, immune privilege is not absolute. In neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and Alzheimer’s disease, immune privilege is breached, resulting in the infiltration of immune cells, chronic inflammation, and progressive neural damage. The breakdown of the BBB, immune cell activation, and dysregulated inflammation contribute to the pathophysiology of these diseases. This review examines the mechanisms that underlie immune privilege in the CNS, how these systems are compromised in neuroinflammatory conditions, and the therapeutic implications for modulating immune responses in the CNS.

        <tr id="Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is the leading cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis worldwide. The neuroimmune interactions between peripheral and central immune systems in angiostrongyliasis remain unclear. In this study, significant infiltration of eosinophils, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and Ly6C monocytes is observed in the brains of AC-infected mice, with macrophages being the most abundant. RNA-seq and SMART-seq analysis of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and DNA sensor gene sets revealed a marked increase in Z-DNA binding protein 1 (Zbp1) expression in infected mice. Confocal microscopy, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry further confirmed that Zbp1 is specifically upregulated in macrophages and microglia. Using Zbp1-knockout mice and flow cytometry, it is found that knockout of Zbp1 enhanced lymphocyte infiltration and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, modulating the immune microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) during AC infection. Mechanistically, it is revealed that in macrophage Zbp1 directly binds to receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) to promote its phosphorylation, subsequently facilitating the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl). The activated Zbp1-pRIP3-pMlkl axis leads to necroptosis and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1α, CXCL9, CXCL10 in macrophages, which recruits and activates immune cells. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of angiostrongyliasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Germ-line deletion of a conserved enhancer (the Fms intrinsic regulatory element, FIRE) in the mouse Csf1r locus causes congenital absence of microglia. Homozygous FIRE deletion on a C57BL/6J background leads to perinatal lethality and hydrocephalus (HC) in surviving pups. We developed a congenic C57BL/6J line with defined regions of non-C57BL/6J genomic DNA, increased postnatal viability and reduced incidence of HC. Both perinatal lethality and HC were eliminated in F2 mice following outcross of the congenic line to CBA/J or BALBc/J backgrounds. To assess the impacts of microglial deficiency in postnatal neurodevelopment we analyzed deep total RNA-seq data from multiple brain regions of wild-type and Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mice. Aside from the loss of microglial-specific transcripts, we found no significant alterations in relative abundance of any cell-type or region-specific transcriptomic signature. Transcripts associated with endosome/lysosome function, which are enriched in microglia, were not affected, suggesting compensatory expression by other cell types. On the C57BL/6J x CBA/J F2 background, congenital absence of microglia did not affect motor activity, behavior or myelination up to 7 months of age but was associated with astrocytosis and calcification in the thalamus. In the congenic C57BL/6J Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mouse line, intraperitoneal transfer of wild-type bone marrow cells (BMT) at weaning led to complete repopulation of the brain with microglia-like cells without giving rise to monocytic intermediates. Our results suggest novel strategies for treatment of microglial deficiency.">

        <tr id="The development of new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic potential of microvascular endothelium. A specific feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the post-COVID syndrome that is characterised by long-term impairment of various organs and systems. The immune pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis requires special attention due to their baseline pro-inflammatory status. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of novel coronavirus infection on the risk of chronic systemic hyper-inflammation and low-grade systemic inflammation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Two main groups consisted of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had survived COVID-19 (mild form) 3 months ago, or at earlier terms, including the subjects with post-COVID symptoms and those free of these symptoms. The comparison group included patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without a history of COVID-19. The control group was presented by healthy blood donors. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFá), D-dimers, troponin I, cortisol, and endothelin I (ET-I) were measured in patients’ plasma by immunoassay technique. On the basis of these markers, we calculated integral indices of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) – the levels of reactivity (RL), and chronic systemic hyper-inflammation (ChSI). Low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) was diagnosed in absence of ChSI, but in cases of simultaneous increase of D-dimer levels 250 ng/ml and ET-I levels 90 pg/ml in the patient. 
The most prevalent symptoms of post-COVID in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were tachycardia, arthralgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, which correspond to the population-wide data. By all empirical parameters, the groups of tuberculosis patients were comparable to each other (p 0.05) and significantly differed from control group. However, evaluation of integral indexes is more crucial for assessing the ‘systemic’ origin of the process. Thus, 23-50% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed subcritical SIR (RL = 1-2), being a feature of ChSI in 7.1-13.6% of cases (both in COVID-19 reconvalescents and non-COVID-19 patients). Meanwhile, all patient groups did not show significant difference in the frequency of LGSI and endothelial dysfunction (p 0.05). However, there was a trend towards an increase of these scores in the following sequence: tuberculosis without COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 + post-COVID syndrome. 
Most patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are not characterized by the development of chronic systemic hyperinflammation. LGSI is the most probable feature of general pathology in tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis infection sufficiently contributes to the development of LGSI, since the frequency and severity of LGSI and its individual manifestations are independent on the new coronavirus infection and signs of post-COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="The immune status of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in different stages of infection remains difficult to determine. In this study, we performed high-throughput single-cell mass cytometry on peripheral blood samples from 10 COVID-19 patients and four healthy donors to analyze their immune status at acute and convalescence phases. During the acute stage, the proportion of neutrophils increased significantly while natural killer (NK) cells decreased. In contrast, during the convalescence phase, the proportion of plasma cells decreased from the acute stage of disease onset and was lower than normal. The proportions of B, mast and plasma cell subsets decreased significantly with the process of disease recovery. Further analysis of the subsets of major immune cell types in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations in different stages showed that in the acute stages of disease progression, the T helper cell 1 (Th1), IgD+ B and neutrophil subsets increased in COVID-19 patients, especially in symptomatic patients, while the central memory CD4+T cells (CD4 TCM), mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) and NK cell subsets decreased significantly, especially in symptomatic patients. Then CD4 TCM and MAIT returned to normal levels at the recovery phase. Dynamic assessment displayed that the immune imbalance at the onset of COVID-19 could be corrected during recovery. Our study provides additional information on the immune status of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations in different stages. These findings may provide new insights into COVID-19 immunotherapy and immune intervention.">

Using PBMC-derived induced microglia-like cells (piMGLCs) in a scalable assay, we screened 489 CNS-penetrant compounds for modulation of microglial phagocytosis of human synaptosomes in a validated assay for microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. Compounds from the library that reduced phagocytosis by ≥2 standard deviations across the library without cytotoxicity were validated in secondary screens, with 28 of them further confirmed to reduce phagocytosis by 50% or more. Image-based morphological measurements were calculated to measure the degree of ramified vs. amoeboid morphotype as an indicator of activation state. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling indicated divergent effects on cell signaling, metabolism, activation, and actin dynamics across confirmed compounds. In particular, multiple CNS-penetrant small molecules with prior FDA approval or demonstration of safety in vivo demonstrated modulatory effects on microglia. These potential disease-modifying agents represent high-priority candidates for repositioning studies in neurodevelopmental, neuroinflammatory, or neurodegenerative disorders.">

        <tr id="Rabies virus (RABV) proteins play dual roles during the infection of complex neural tissue, the generation and spread of new virions and the active inhibition of cellular innate immune pathways, both contributing to rabies’ lethality. While spatially-distinct RABV protein residues specializing in virus-centric and immune-inhibitory functions have been identified, how these dual functions interact to shape infection outcomes across diverse types of host brain cells is unknown. To “unmask” and study how innate immune inhibition affects the transcriptional regulation of the human and viral genome with cellular resolution, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of co-cultured human brain cell types, comparing infection dynamics of a wild-type RABV isolate virus to a mutant virus in which six critical point mutations in the phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M) RABV proteins selectively neuter antagonism of interferon- and NF-κB- dependent cellular responses. Our analysis reveals that RABV gene expression is shaped by host cell type and that wild-type RABV infection induces small-scale, cell-type conserved transcriptional programs that may support infection by hijacking transcriptional feedback systems that control pro-viral host cell factors while minimizing anti-viral responses. In contrast to accepted models, disinhibited innate immune signaling increases RABV transcriptional output across infected cell types. Most strikingly, we discovered a subpopulation of astrocytes that supports an average of 6-fold higher viral mRNA expression through a massive host cell transcriptional change involving ∼38% of astrocyte expressed genes. Our analysis suggests that these astrocytes we term “pro-viral” are a rare subtype present in the human brain and are primed to play a protective role during viral infection in concert with interferon-sensitive microglia recalcitrant to infection.">

        <tr id="Upon entry into the host cell, the non-structural proteins 3, 4, and 6 (Nsp3, Nsp 4, and Nsp6) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) facilitate the formation of double- membrane vesicles (DMVs) through extensive rearrangement of the host cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to replicate the viral genome and translate viral proteins. To dissect the functional roles of each Nsp and the molecular mechanisms underlying the ER changes, we exploited both yeast S. cerevisiae and human cell experimental systems. Our results demonstrate that Nsp4 alone is sufficient to induce ER structural changes. Nsp4 expression led to robust activation of both the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the ER surveillance (ERSU) cell cycle checkpoint, resulting in cortical ER inheritance block and septin ring mislocalization. Interestingly, these ER morphological changes occurred independently of the canonical UPR and ERSU components but were mediated by the endosomal sorting complex for transport (ESCRT) proteins Vps4 and Vps24 in yeast. Similarly, ER structural changes occurred in human cells upon Nsp4 expression, providing a basis for a minimal experimental system for testing the involvement of human ESCRT proteins and ultimately advancing our understanding of DMV formation.">

        <tr id="Peripheral neuropathy is a common and debilitating side effect of the chemotherapeutic bortezomib (BTZ). To explore the mechanisms underlying BTZ-induced neuropathy (BIPN), we developed a mouse model that replicates the route of administration and approximates the prolonged BTZ exposure experienced by patients. We find that male mice treated with BTZ experience more severe sensorimotor dysfunction and axon loss compared to females and observed similar results when analyzing human data. Using single cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal that BTZ significantly alters the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) microenvironment in mice, producing pronounced sex-specific changes in satellite glial cells (SGCs) in males and females and dysregulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly in males. These changes are accompanied by expansion of macrophages, which is more pronounced in males. We identify four macrophage subtypes in the DRG, including a pro-fibrotic population that is exclusively associated with BIPN. Depletion of macrophages via anti-CSF1R treatment in male mice prevents BTZ-induced SGC activation and aberrant collagen deposition in DRGs, potently preserves peripheral axons, and improves functional outcomes. These findings highlight SGCs, neuroinflammation and dysregulation of the ECM as drivers of sex-specific differences in BIPN and suggest that targeting neuroinflammation is a promising therapeutic strategy to treat this disease. One Sentence Summary Inflammation and neurofibrosis in DRGs underlie sex-specific differences in bortezomib-induced neuropathy and are promising treatment targets.">

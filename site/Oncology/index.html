        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Bats can host viruses of pandemic concern without developing disease. The mechanisms underlying their exceptional resilience to viral infections are largely unresolved, necessitating the development of physiologically relevant and genetically tractable research models. Here, we developed respiratory and intestinal organoids that recapitulated the cellular diversity of the in vivo epithelium present in Rousettus aegyptiacus, the natural reservoir for the highly pathogenic Marburg virus (MARV). In contrast to human counterparts, bat organoids and mucosal tissue exhibited elevated constitutive expression of innate immune effectors, including type I interferon-ε (IFNε) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Upon infection with diverse zoonotic viruses, including MARV, bat organoids strongly induced type I and III IFN responses, which conferred robust antiviral protection. Type III IFNλ3 additionally displayed virus-independent self-amplification, acting as an ISG to enhance antiviral immunity. Our organoid platform reveals key features of bat epithelial antiviral immunity that may inform therapeutic strategies for viral disease resilience.">

        <tr id="To complement serology as a tool in public health interventions, we introduced the “celluloepidemiology” paradigm where we leveraged pathogen-specific T cell responses at a population level to advance our epidemiological understanding of infectious diseases, using SARS-CoV-2 as a model. Applying flow cytometry and machine learning on data from more than 500 individuals, we showed that the number of T cells with positive expression of functional markers not only could distinguish patients who recovered from COVID-19 from controls and pre-COVID donors but also identify previously unrecognized asymptomatic patients from mild, moderate, and severe recovered patients. The celluloepidemiology approach was uniquely capable to differentiate health care worker groups with different SARS-CoV-2 exposures from each other. T cell receptor (TCR) profiling strengthened our analysis by revealing that SARS-CoV-2–specific TCRs were more abundant in patients than in controls. We believe that adding data on T cell reactivity will complement serology and augment the value of infection morbidity modeling for populations.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context-dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases. We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT2. Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model, revealing SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells (macrophages and T lymphocytes) and repair Schwann cells, as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve-resident cell types. Notably, endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines (Ccl9, Cxcl5) and complement components (C3, C4b, C6) in response to chronic SARM1 activation, indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non-immune nerve-resident cells. Analysis of CD45+ immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b+ macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation. We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves. Remarkably, T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model. These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1-dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease.

        <tr id="Peripheral surgery evokes neuroimmune activation in the central nervous system and modulates immune cell polarization in the ischemic brain. However, the phenotypic change of microglia and myeloid cells within post-surgical ischemic brain tissue remain poorly defined. Using an integrated approach that combines single-cell RNA sequencing with comprehensive biological analysis in a perioperative ischemic stroke (PIS) model, we identified a distinct Spp1-positive macrophage/microglia (Spp1+ Mac/MG) subgroup that exhibit enriched anti-inflammatory pathways with distinct lipid metabolic reprogrammed profile. Moreover, using immunofluorescence staining, we identified the expression of Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) in Spp1+F4/80+ cells and Spp1+Iba-1+ cells. Intraperitoneal administration of semaglutide, a GLP1R agonist clinically approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulted in a significant reduction of cerebral infarct volume in PIS mice compared to that in ischemic stroke (IS) mice. Meanwhile, semaglutide treatment also increased the proportion of Spp1+Edu+Iba-1+ cells 3 days after PIS. Using high-parameter flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining and RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that semaglutide treatment significantly attenuated the expression of neuroinflammatory markers in mice following PIS. We also found that semaglutide treatment significantly ameliorated sensorimotor dysfunction up to 3 days after PIS in mice. Our current finding reveal a novel protective Spp1+Mac/MG subset after PIS and demonstrated that it can be upregulated by semaglutide. We propose that targeting Spp1+Mac/MG subsets using semaglutide could serve as a promising strategy to attenuate the exacerbated neuroinflammation in PIS.

        <tr id="Abstract Proliferation of microglia represents a physiological process, which is accelerated in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). The effect of such neurodegeneration-associated microglial proliferation on function and disease progression remains unclear. Here, we show that proliferation results in profound alterations of cellular function by providing evidence that newly proliferated microglia show impaired beta-amyloid clearance in vivo. Through sorting of proliferating microglia of APP/PS1 mice and subsequent transcriptome analysis, we define unique proliferation-associated transcriptomic signatures that change with age and beta-amyloid accumulation and are characterized by enrichment of immune system-related pathways. Of note, we identify the DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-Linked (DDX3X) as a key molecule to modulate microglia activation and cytokine secretion and it is expressed in the AD brain. Together, these results argue for a novel concept by which phenotypic and functional microglial changes occur longitudinally as a response to accelerated proliferation in a neurodegenerative environment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory CNS disease with heterogeneous manifestation. Prognostic markers for early classification of MS are currently under investigation. Higher diagnostic resolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to contribute significantly to patient stratification, which should be especially important for a subgroup of patients with high risk to convert to a progressive disease course. This study aimed to determine whether spectral flow cytometry of CSF cells could identify pathogenic CD4+ T cell subset in MS. Using a two-step approach, we designed a marker panel informed by publicly available transcriptomic datasets from early human MS and our own single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine MS model. Notably, chronic (‘phase’) markers such as Il7r and Ramp3 (associated with memory T cells), Itgb1 (integrin beta-1) and anti-apoptotic genes like Dnaja1, Hsph1 and Jun/AP-1 were enriched in EAE. These markers reflect pro-survival signalling and tissue-residency characteristics, including CXCR6, CD69 and Bhlhe40, which suggest an adaptation of CD4+ T cells towards persistent neuroinflammatory responses in chronic EAE. This phase-specific marker profile highlights CD4+ T cells as both indicators and contributors to disease progression in EAE. Translating these findings to MS datasets, we found an enrichment of phase-specific markers in CSF cells. Spectral flow cytometry in an independent MS cohort revealed distinct memory and effector T cell subsets, indicating unique CSF signatures in MS. This study underscores the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of CD4+ T cells detectable by spectral flow cytometry, enhancing diagnostic resolution of CSF cells and informing more precise therapeutic strategies for MS.">

        <tr id="Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. The choroid plexus (ChP), serving as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier, plays essential roles in immune response to stress and brain homeostasis. However, the cellular and molecular contributions of the ChP to AD progression remain inadequately understood. Methods To elucidate the molecular abnormalities during the early stages of AD, we acquired single-cell transcription profiling of ChP from APP/PS1 mice with early-stage of Aβ pathology and litter-mate controls. The transcriptional alterations that occurred in each cell type were identified by differentially expressed genes, cell–cell communications and pseudotemporal trajectory analysis. The findings were subsequently validated by a series of in situ and in vitro assays. Results We constructed a comprehensive atlas of ChP at single-cell resolution and identified six major cell types and immune subclusters in male mice. The majority of dysregulated genes were found in the epithelial cells of APP/PS1 mice in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice, and most of these genes belonged to down-regulated module involved in mitochondrial respirasome assembly, cilium organization, and barrier integrity. The disruption of the epithelial barrier resulted in the downregulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) secretion in APP/PS1 mice, leading to macrophage activation and increased phagocytosis of Aβ. Concurrently, ligands (e.g., APOE) secreted by macrophages and other ChP cells facilitated the entry of lipids into ependymal cells, leading to lipid accumulation and the activation of microglia in the brain parenchyma in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT controls. Conclusions Taken together, these data profiled early transcriptional and cellular abnormalities of ChP within an AD mouse model, providing novel insights of cerebral vasculature into the pathobiology of AD.

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune‐stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA‐seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell–cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage–endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage‐derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage‐driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

Spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels did not decline in any cohort following repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, nor did the expression of exhaustion markers on spike-specific or total T cells increase. T cell production of multiple cytokines (i.e. polyfunctionality) in response to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 did not decline in any cohort following repeated vaccination. None of the cohorts displayed elevated levels of terminally differentiated T cells following multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Thus, repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was not associated with increased T cell exhaustion in older frail adults, immunosuppressed individuals, or healthy adults.">

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 was the causing agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and massive economic losses. Although there are already several vaccines licensed, as novel variants develop, understanding the immune response induced by vaccination and natural infection is key for the development of future vaccines. Methods: In this study, we have used flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing to assess the longitudinal CD8+ T-cell response against natural infection and vaccination in convalescent and vaccinated individuals, from early activation to immune memory establishment. Moreover, we have characterized the T-cell receptor clonality and diversity at different stages post-infection and post-vaccination. Results: We have found no significant differences in CD8+ T-cell activation during the first three weeks post-infection compared to the first three weeks after first vaccination. Conversely, natural infection resulted in sustained high levels of T-cell activation at four weeks post-infection, a point in which we observed a decline in T-cell activation post-vaccination despite boosting with a second vaccination shot. Moreover, additional vaccination did not result in enhanced T-cell activation. Of note, we have observed variations in the memory subset structure at every stage of disease and vaccination. Overall, both infection and immunization induced a highly diverse T-cell receptor repertoire, which was observed both between study groups and between patients inside a given group. Conclusions: These data contribute to expand our knowledge about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination and call for additional strategies to enhance T-cell responses by booster immunization.">

        <tr id="Targeting inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major unmet need. Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2LD) selectively increases regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers in patients with coronary artery disease. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor analyses and show that IL-2LD clonally expands effector Treg cells in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The clonally expanded Treg cells upregulate key immunosuppressive and metabolic pathways and show an increased number of predicted ligand–receptor interactions. These Treg cells also display similar predicted antigen specificities, which cluster with published sequences specific to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. By tracking the T cell receptors of single cells over time, we identify an inflammatory polarization of the T cell compartment after myocardial infarction, which is restrained by IL-2LD. We identify BACH2 as a repressor of the Treg effector program. However, BACH2-mediated regulation is bypassed with IL-2LD. Overall, these results lend insight into the IL-2-driven clonal expansion program in human Treg cells, with important therapeutic implications for patients with cardiovascular and other immune-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the TEC family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, including B lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Selective BTK inhibitors (BTKi) have shown efficacy in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we investigated the role of BTK in human and mouse myeloid cells in in vitro and in vivo studies. Methods We evaluated i) the impact of the BTK inhibitor (BTKi) evobrutinib on monocyte markers for activation, costimulation, adhesion and phagocytosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from healthy and MS subjects; ii) the therapeutic effects and the action of evobrutinib on myeloid cell phenotype in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS; iii) the contribution of BTK in short-lived vs. long-lived myeloid cells to EAE expression via experiments with double transgenic mice allowing inducible inactivation of BTK in CX3CR1 expressing cells. Results We report that BTKi supported monocyte expression of VLA4/CD49d, an integrin directing immune cell migration towards the central nervous system, and CD163, a well-known scavenger receptor involved in removal of myelin debris, in samples from healthy subjects. This effect was maintained under distinct inflammatory settings and replicated with PBMC of MS subjects. Therapeutic intervention with evobrutinib ameliorated EAE severity and was associated with a significant modest decrease in the frequency of CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory macrophages. However, conditional BTK deletion in short-lived or long-lived CX3CR1-positive cells did not reduce EAE severity. Discussion This functional evidence questions the real contribution of BTK expressing myeloid cells to experimental MS.">

        <tr id="Background Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play a central role in atherosclerosis by undergoing phenotypic modulation from a quiescent, contractile state to a range of synthetic phenotypes, including fibroblast-like, macrophage-like, and lipid-laden foam cell–like states. However, a comprehensive multimodal characterization and understanding of the transcriptional programs driving these transitions remain incomplete. Methods To comprehensively define the phenotypic diversity of VSMCs during atherosclerosis progression, we performed in-depth profiling using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing in a VSMC lineage-tracing atherosclerotic mouse model. Insights from these datasets guided the design of targeted in vitro experiments to investigate candidate regulatory mechanisms. Results Single-cell multi-omics revealed extensive cellular heterogeneity within atherosclerotic plaques, including a rare population of VSMC-derived macrophage-like cells, whose presence was confirmed by histological analysis. These studies also identified a substantial population of VSMC-derived foam cells, comprising approximately 70% of all foam cells in the lesions. These cells exhibited activation of gene programs associated with lipid metabolism, proliferation, and tumor-like features. The transcription factor Bhlhe40 emerged as a key regulator of this phenotypic transition, with elevated expression in VSMC-derived foam cells during disease progression. Functional knockdown of Bhlhe40 suppressed VSMC phenotypic switching and foam cell characteristics, underscoring its potential role as a driver of VSMC modulation. Conclusions These findings advance our understanding of VSMC phenotypic modulation in atherosclerosis and highlight Bhlhe40 as a key regulator of this process. Elucidating the mechanisms governing VSMC plasticity may offer new therapeutic opportunities to reduce cardiovascular risk by targeting disease-driving cellular transitions.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is contributed by B lymphocytes, macrophages, and microglia. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an intracellular enzyme within these cells that modulates their inflammatory properties. Thus, central nervous system–penetrant inhibitors of BTK may counter immune dysregulation, and this aspiration is highlighted by 11 phase 3 clinical trials in MS to inhibit this enzyme. Despite the keen interest, the spatial and temporal elevation of BTK in lesions of MS and its models is not well characterized. Methods We used quantitative fluorescence immunohistology to assess the expression of BTK and a phosphorylated activated form in different lesion types of MS and 3 of its models: inflammatory experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), toxin-induced demyelination of lysolecithin, and oxidized phosphatidylcholine injuries. GDC-0853 (fenebrutinib), a BTK inhibitor in phase 3 clinical trials in MS, was evaluated in EAE for its capacity to alter disease course. Results We observed low expression of BTK and a phosphorylated form (pBTK) in murine spinal cord but significant upregulation in white matter lesions inflicted by oxidized phosphatidylcholine, lysolecithin, and EAE. Expression predominantly localized to microglia/macrophages shown through colocalization analysis by Imaris 3-dimensional rendering. GDC-0853 (fenebrutinib) significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE when administered prophylactically and marginally ameliorated disability when initiated from onset of clinical disability. Finally, we report the increase in BTK expression in microglia/macrophages in active plaques and in the hypercellular rim of chronic active lesions of MS. In the inactive core of chronic active MS lesions, the few remaining HLA-DR+ myeloid cells were still BTK immunoreactive. Discussion Our results demonstrate that BTK immunoreactivity is normally undetectable in uninjured areas or normal-appearing white matter of human and murine CNS, but that expression becomes prominent in lesions with hypercellular aggregates of microglia and macrophages. Staining for pBTK reveals that its upregulation declines in the later stage of lysolecithin and chronic stage of EAE injury while BTK upregulation is maintained. Our collective results support the rationale of using brain-penetrant BTK inhibitors to modulate the elevation of this enzyme in microglia/macrophages within inflamed plaques of MS.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a heterogeneous infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The distinctive features of COVID-19 infection encompass a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe illness involving diverse underlying pathophysiological processes such as hyperinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic microangiopathies, and multiple organ failure. However, the host responses to COVID-19, including systemic inflammation and immunity against SARS-CoV-2, remain largely undefined across different disease states. Here, we performed global transcriptome profiling of 228 peripheral blood samples of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations and subsequent clustering using an unsupervised algorithm. We identified various transcriptomic clusters and globally dysregulated immune-related pathways, leading to distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles in severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This underscores the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release. Additionally, our results reveal variances in circulating cell populations and the activation of apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients with diverse clinical presentations offers valuable insights into molecular mechanisms and may inform clinical decisions on anti-inflammatory therapies.

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by episodic relapses of neurological symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of patients is key to prevent relapses and irreversible damage to the CNS. However, development of therapies targeting early MS is constrained by the lack of knowledge of early MS disease pathogenesis. In RRMS, nervous tissue damage is induced by CNS-infiltrating immune cells, including T cells. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the early events of CNS infiltration by T cells in RRMS, including their interaction with astrocytes and brain endothelial cells. Using a human in vitro model system and tissue samples obtained from newly diagnosed patients and healthy individuals, we found that CD8+CD20+ T cells could cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid-barrier in the absence of inflammation. As CD8+CD20+ T cells are present in the CNS before inflammation and are highly enriched in MS lesions once the disease is initiated, they may be among the first effector cells in RRMS. Our study also showed that CD4+CD20+ T cells can stimulate brain endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules and chemokines needed for peripheral immune cells to adhere and migrate through the BBB, and stimulate astrocytes to produce chemokines directing transmigrating cells to the site of inflammation. This suggests that CD4+CD20+ T cells, once migrated to the CNS, strengthens the infiltration of immune cells to the CNS and hereby amplify CNS inflammation. Altogether, this indicates that CD20+ T cells play a role in the early phases of MS-inflammation and therefore are candidate targets for early treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) is a severe condition that may follow sepsis and is characterized by ongoing inflammation and immune suppression, diminishing quality of life and potentially causing death. The role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in PICS, despite their association with thrombopoiesis, is not well understood. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile MKs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from 11 patients, including six with PICS, five with sepsis, and five healthy controls, to determine the diversity and molecular signatures of the MKs. Five subgroups of MKs are identified (MK1-MK5), and their proportions vary across the groups. MK1 and MK2 are predominant in PICS. Gene Ontology analysis shows that genes related to antigen processing and presentation and IL-17 signaling are enriched in MK1, whereas genes associated with platelet degranulation and neutrophil activation are enriched in MK2. Moreover, the expression level of CCL5 is markedly increased in MKs. Ligand-receptor analysis reveals dynamic interactions among MKs and T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages, suggesting a broad role of MKs in immune homeostasis. In PICS model mice, MKs regulate systemic inflammation by reducing the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A and promoting lung tissue repair. Our findings establish MKs as essential components of the immune system in PICS and provide new insights into their potential as therapeutic targets for post-sepsis immune dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a prevalent condition whose recurrence leads to multiple adverse effects. Previous studies on INS pathogenesis primarily focused on immune dysregulation, particularly T-cell changes and their correlation with cytokine shifts. Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell dysfunction also plays a role. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effective treatment strategies remains incomplete. Methods This study investigates changes in gene expressions and cellular interactions of immune cells at a single-cell level using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). And subsequently validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. Results We identified seven main clusters using unsupervised clustering of 103,213 high-quality single cells. Through unsupervised clustering, patient-specific T cells (IFI44L + CD4 + T cells) that exhibited a pronounced elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is identified. Activation of ISGs and interferon (IFN)-related pathways are also observed in other clusters. Specifically, this study demonstrates that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role by promoting the interaction between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and receptors on B cells. This interaction triggers the release of autoantibodies, thereby initiating INS pathogenesis. Furthermore, telitacicept has shown efficacy in treating pediatric patients with frequent relapse NS(FRNS). Conclusions Overall, our findings underscore the role of interferon and its related pathways in INS pathogenesis, providing novel therapeutic interventions for NS.

        <tr id="In this comprehensive review, we delve into the significant body of research on single-cell transcriptomics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to understand neurological diseases with autoimmune, neurodegenerative, infectious, or oncogenic origins. We thoroughly examine all published studies in these areas, with a particular focus on multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. For these diseases, we review findings related to immune cells that infiltrate the brain, based on postmortem brain tissue analyses and include CSF cytometry findings. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), and single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) are increasingly vital tools for studying CSF to understand various aspects of neurological diseases. These advanced techniques allow researchers to explore the etiopathogenesis of these conditions by identifying the roles and interactions of different immune cells. scRNA-seq provides detailed insights into the gene expression profiles of individual cells, revealing how specific cell types contribute to disease progression. scTCR-seq and scBCR-seq enable the study of clonal expansion in T and B cells, respectively, and facilitate antigen prediction, helping to uncover the nature of antigens that trigger adaptive immune responses. By integrating these technologies, scientists can define new therapeutic targets and categorize patients, leading to more personalized and effective treatments. This review highlights the promising advancements and addresses the current limitations of single-cell transcriptomics in the context of CSF and neurological diseases, setting the stage for future breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, including prolonged viral shedding and emergence of mutations. To investigate the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, seven SIV+ rhesus macaques were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 in all macaques was mild. SARS-CoV-2 replication persisted in the upper, but not the lower respiratory tract for 14 days post-infection. Animals showed impaired generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cells. Animals also displayed transient changes in microbial communities in the upper airway and gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 evolution was observed in the upper respiratory tract. This study demonstrates that SIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in rhesus macaques recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in PLWH. We show that SIV impairs anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, potentially leading to prolonged viral shedding, altered pathogenesis, and viral evolution. This highlights the importance of HIV status in COVID-19 and supports the use of this model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive, human-specific commensal infectious pathogen, poses a significant global health threat, especially in children under five, often resulting in fatalities. The intricacies of the immune response in pneumococcal meningitis (PM) remain elusive, necessitating a meticulous examination of immune cell subsets at the single-cell resolution. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PM patients and healthy individuals. We found significant relative changes in the compositions of immune cell subset, with significant relative increases in platelets, neutrophils, and their precursors, alongside relative decreases in natural killer (NK) cells, T cell subtypes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PM patients. Functional enrichment analyses revealed an up-regulation of neutrophils-related immune genes across multiple immune cell types, including platelets, myeloid cells and B cells, suggesting excessive neutrophil activation. However, a down-regulation of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation in myeloid cells and B cells in the PM group indicated a relative dampening of the adaptive immune response in the PM patients. This was further corroborated by the reduced proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T cells. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxity were down-regulated in both NK cells and T cells, alongside impaired T cell activation. Notably, distinct B cell subtypes, including unique naïve B cell clusters, demonstrated differentially expressed genes associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of immune responses in PM. The identified cellular and molecular signatures offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention and provide a foundation for further investigation into the immunopathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis.">

        <tr id="Differences in immune profiles of children and adults with COVID-19 have been previously described. However, no systematic studies have been reported from infants hospitalized with severe disease. We applied a multidimensional approach to decipher the immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infected infants (n = 26; 10 subacute, 11 moderate and 5 severe disease; median age = 1.6 months) and matched controls (n = 14; median age = 2 months). Single cell (scRNA-seq) profiling of PBMCs revealed substantial alterations in cell composition in SARS-CoV-2 infected infants; with most cell-types switching to an interferon-stimulated gene (ISGhi) state including: (i) CD14+ monocytes co-expressing ISGs and inflammasome-related molecules, (ii) ISGhi naive CD4+ T cells, (iii) ISGhi proliferating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and (iv) ISGhi naive and transitional B cells. We observe increased serum concentrations of both interferons and inflammatory cytokines in infected infants. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are also consistently detected in the absence of anti-IFN autoantibodies. Compared with infected adults, infants display a similar ISG signature in monocytes but a markedly enhanced ISG signature in T and B cells. These findings provide insights into the distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of life and underscore the importance of further defining the unique features of early life immunity.">

        <tr id="Introduction The chronic nature of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) allows it to coexist with diverse pathologies. However, it remains unclear whether immune alterations associated with LTBI influence COVID-19 coinfection and patient outcomes. This study aims to compare the immune phenotype of patients with LTBI/COVID-19 to those with COVID-19 alone, in order to assess whether latent tuberculosis infection induces significant immune cell alterations. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured and stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (M. bovis BCG) to evaluate cellular distribution and function. Results the LTBI/COVID-19 group exhibited a narrower range of symptoms and required less complex treatment regimens than the COVID-19 group. The cellular evaluation revealed that individuals with COVID-19 displayed a distinct immune profile, characterized by a predominance of monocytes expressing pro-inflammatory and regulatory markers, including TNFR2, HLA-DR+TNFR2, and CD71. While CD4+ T cell subpopulation distribution and function were similar across groups, LTBI/COVID-19 and COVID-19 exhibited similar frequencies of CD8+perforin+ and CD8+Granzime B+ T cells. However, LTBI/COVID-19 displays lower soluble levels of granzyme B and perforin in culture supernatants and perforin, granulysin, and sFas in plasma compared to COVID-19. Notably, CD8+ T cells from LTBI/COVID-19 showed higher antigen-specific degranulation than COVID-19. Moreover, LTBI/COVID-19 individuals predominantly displayed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with highly polarized, compact mitochondria at baseline, which remained unchanged under stimulation. In contrast, COVID-19 had T cells with highly polarized, fragmented mitochondria at baseline, a profile that persisted under stimulation. Conclusion The findings reveal significant alterations in monocytes and T cells of individuals with LTBI/COVID-19, suggesting that co-infection may induce changes in the cellular phenotype and cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes severe intestinal damage and high mortality in neonatal piglets. The continuous emergence of new strains has brought new challenges to prevention and control. In this study, we isolated and characterized a prevalent PEDV virulent strain and analyzed 19,612 jejunal cells from PEDV-infected and control piglets using single-cell sequencing, revealing significant changes in cellular composition, gene expression, and intercellular communication. In response to PEDV infection, epithelial repair was enhanced through increased proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, transit-amplifying (TA) cells, and intestinal progenitor cells into enterocytes. Additionally, PEDV disrupted intercellular communication, compromising epithelial functionality while triggering immune responses, with IFN-γ and IL-10 signaling activation acting as critical regulators of immune balance and tissue homeostasis. Beyond enterocytes, viral genes were detected in various other cell types. Further experiments confirmed that PEDV could initiate replication in B and T lymphocytes but was unable to produce infectious progeny, with T cells additionally undergoing virus-induced apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into PEDV tropism, immune evasion, and epithelial repair, revealing complex host-pathogen interactions that shape disease progression and tissue regeneration, thereby contributing to a better understanding of enteric coronavirus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE The persistent circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) poses a major threat to the swine industry, with emerging strains complicating prevention and control efforts. Currently, no effective measures completely prevent virus transmission, highlighting the need to understand PEDV-host interactions. In this study, we isolated a prevalent virulent strain and used single-cell sequencing to identify new PEDV-infected cell types and explore the complex interplay between the host and PEDV. These findings provide essential insights into viral pathogenesis and facilitate the design of targeted antiviral interventions.

        <tr id="Introduction The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (XBB.1.5) variants, has substantially influenced the clinical and immunological landscape of COVID-19. This study investigates the differential pathogenicity and immune responses in a feline model infected with these variants, focusing on neutrophil activation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and cytokine profiles. Methods Eight pathogen-free cats were inoculated with B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2 (n=3), XBB.1.5 (Omicron) SARS-CoV-2 (n=3), or vehicle (n=2), and clinical assessments, histopathological examinations, and cytokine analyses were performed post-infection. Results Results demonstrate that Delta-infected cats exhibit more severe clinical manifestations characterized by significant elevation in respiratory effort, wheezing, and systemic inflammation compared to Omicron-infected cats, which show milder symptoms, primarily confined to the upper respiratory tract. Histopathological findings suggest pronounced lung damage in Delta-infected cats, whereas Omicron infection resulted in localized pathology. Cytokine profiling demonstrates heightened proinflammatory responses, particularly in Delta-infected cats, characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α while Omicron infection results in less pronounced inflammatory responses. Moreover, neutrophil-related parameters, including total neutrophil counts and banded neutrophils, were significantly elevated in Delta-infected cats, correlating with enhanced NET formation as evidenced by increased NETs-related markers MPO, NE, and citrullinated H3, and NET-specific markers MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free DNA. Discussion This study underscores the importance of variant-specific immune responses and highlights the need for targeted therapeutic strategies that mitigate severe lung injury associated with Delta infection, while also considering the distinct immune dynamics observed with the Omicron variant. Furthermore, results support the importance of delineating immune responses concerning future variants. These findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in companion animals and inform public health strategies as new variants continue to emerge.">

        <tr id="Atherosclerosis (AS), the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases, is a chronic inflammatory disorder involving lipid metabolism, immune dysregulation, and cell death. Pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory programmed cell death, is implicated in AS progression, yet its molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential remain incompletely understood. A multi-omics framework integrating transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to identify and prioritize pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in AS. Functional enrichment, immune infiltration profiling, and protein–protein interaction network analyses were conducted. Experimental validation was conducted using in vitro and in vivo models. Thirty-six PRGs were identified, with TREM2, TNF, MMP9, IL1B, and CASP1 emerging as key regulators of pyroptosis and inflammation. These PRGs demonstrated robust diagnostic potential in internal and external datasets. Immune infiltration analysis stratified AS patients into subtypes, with Cluster 2 characterized by elevated macrophage pyroptosis and a pro-inflammatory immune microenvironment. Single-cell analysis confirmed TREM2 upregulation in macrophages and monocytes, linking it to immune activation and plaque instability. Experimental validation revealed TREM2’s dual role in promoting macrophage lipid accumulation and pyroptosis. This study establishes PRGs, particularly TREM2, as critical modulators of AS progression. These findings enhance our understanding of pyroptosis in AS and provide a framework for developing PRG-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a major health emergency since its emergence in late 2019. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of COVID-19, leading to severe illness, i.e. coagulopathy, multi-organ failure. FX06, a fibrin-derived peptide naturally occurring in the human body, formerly known as Bβ15-42, is a promising therapeutic candidate for endothelial complications like capillary leakage in COVID-19 and other forms of acute respiratory disorders. The aim of this project is to investigate whether FX06 can attenuate COVID-19 cytokine-triggered inflammatory processes in vitro. Methods To mimic the inflammatory status of COVID-19, a human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell line (ECs) – HULEC-5a, was treated with a cytokine cocktail comprised of ten different cytokines or chemokines at concentrations found in serum profiles of COVID-19 patients with severe illness, further referred to as the severe cytokine cocktail. ECs were treated with the severe cytokine cocktail for 24 h, in the absence or presence of FX06 for 2 h. Results The severe cytokine cocktail enhanced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-endothelial adhesion and monolayer transmigration. This deleterious effect was significantly reduced by FX06. FX06 was also shown to mitigate the cytotoxic activity of allogeneic CD8+ T cells, which increased upon cytokine treatment. FX06 restored continuous vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin/CD144 distribution on the EC surface and reversed morphological changes mediated by the severe cytokine cocktail, such as the elongation of F-actin stress fibers. FX06 reduced capillary-like structure formation of the severe cytokine cocktail treated-ECs, indicating FX06 down-regulated the pro-inflammatory angiogenic activity caused by the severe cytokine cocktail. Additionally, FX06 might assist in maintaining the normal barrier function of ECs by altering the surface expression of Syndecan-1 (SDC1/CD138). Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses demonstrated that FX06 in the presence of the severe cytokine cocktail inactivated RhoGTPase, which was confirmed by western blotting that FX06 attenuated RhoA, a member of RhoGTPase, enhanced by the severe cytokine cocktail and down-regulated the expression of the phosphorylated downstream protein, ROCK1. Conclusion Overall, FX06 shows promising potential in normalizing ECs and reducing vascular leakage to protect the endothelium against the proinflammatory effect of COVID-19-triggered cytokines.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound impact on global health, with nearly 800 million cases reported in the Americas alone. The clinical presentation of the disease is highly variable, with approximately half of all patients experiencing severe symptoms. This variability confounds the complex interplay between immune responses and disease severity. Severe cases are often characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. Over 88% of COVID-19 patients have multiple comorbidities; factors such as age and pre-existing conditions further modulate immune responses and contribute to the severity of the disease. While some studies have reported differences in cytokine profiles between severity groups, larger, well-designed cohorts are needed to clarify these relationships. Natural Killer cells, which are critical for the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2, are often impaired and contribute to immune exhaustion. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 evades innate immune defenses through accessory proteins that inhibit interferon signaling and exacerbate cytokine storms and inflammation. This integrative review aims to synthesize findings from 2020 onward and provide insights into the innate immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and their contributions to disease pathogenesis. Understanding cytokine dynamics, NK cell behaviors, and viral immune evasion strategies is critical for advancing therapeutic approaches.">

Surprisingly, we identified a pleocytosis in the CSF, most pronounced in patients with early PD. Single-cell RNAseq revealed increases in CSF-specific microglia-like macrophages expressing JAK-STAT and TNFα signaling signatures in prodromal PD, with a lack of T cell activation in the CSF. The CSF macrophages exhibited similar transcriptional profiles to dural macrophages from human α-synuclein-expressing PD model mice. These findings uncover a myeloid-mediated TNFα inflammatory process in the CNS of patients with prodromal PD, suggesting a novel pathological mechanism in disease etiology.">

        <tr id="Background Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) triggers a dynamic immune response involving macrophages, However, the functional heterogeneity of these cells and the mechanisms through which they promote repair remain unclear. Although the neuropeptide CGRP has been shown to modulate macrophage phenotypes in other pathological contexts, its role in ICH recovery and white matter repair remains unexplored. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45 + cells from ICH mice (GSE167593 and GSE230414 datasets) identified macrophage subsets. Flow cytometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), behavioral assays, and immunofluorescence validated macrophage dynamics and white matter (WM) integrity. Bone marrow and skull analyses traced macrophage origins. The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was tested via intraperitoneal administration in ICH mice, with outcomes assessed through transcriptomics, ultrastructural imaging, and functional recovery. Results scRNA-seq revealed sustained accumulation of THBS1 + macrophages post-ICH, correlating with WM repair and neurological recovery. These macrophages exhibited pro-repair and remyelination gene signatures (e.g., Arg1, Tgm2). Bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, particularly skull-resident populations, served as the primary source of THBS1 + macrophages. CGRP, elevated in meninges and bone marrow post-ICH, drove macrophage polarization toward THBS + phenotypes. CGRP administration expanded THBS1-positive macrophages in the bone marrow and brain, improving WM integrity (reduced radial diffusivity, higher fractional anisotropy) and sensorimotor function. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed enhanced myelin regeneration (lower g-ratio) in CGRP-treated mice. Conclusions This study identifies a neuroimmune axis wherein CGRP promotes bone marrow-derived THBS1 + macrophages to facilitate WM repair and functional recovery after ICH. Targeting CGRP-macrophage signaling offers a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery in hemorrhagic brain injury.

        <tr id="Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may present with a wide clinical spectrum, including extrapulmonary involvement, such as neurological damage. Although the pathogenesis of neurological COVID-19 still remains unclear, some studies have discussed the potential association between tissue injury and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and/or immune imbalance. These two mechanisms are non-mutually exclusive; however, exacerbated inflammatory-response-induced neurological damage appears to be more aligned with COVID-19 pathogenesis, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication in the CNS remains widely discussed. Herein, we dissect this last issue, highlighting some evidence on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, as well as discussing gaps that should be addressed for a better understanding of its potential neurotropism, specifically in the CNS. Finally, we propose some deeper reflections on the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic potential.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological issues, including cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19, is also a risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation in COVID-19 patients, and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD. SARS-CoV-2 also induces cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We hypothesized that eNOS deficiency would worsen neuroinflammation, senescence, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and hypercoagulability in eNOS-deficient mice. Six-month-old eNOS+/− (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and wild-type (WT) male mice were infected with mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2. Mice were evaluated for weight loss, viral load, and markers of inflammation and senescence 3 days post-infection. eNOS+/− mice showed more weight loss (~15%) compared to WT mice (~5%) and increased inflammatory markers (Ccl2, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, IL-1β, and IL-6) and senescence markers (p53 and p21). They also exhibited higher microglial activation (Iba1) and increased plasma coagulation and BBB permeability, despite comparable lung viral loads and absence of virus in the brain. This is the first experimental evidence demonstrating that eNOS deficiency exacerbates SARS-CoV-2-induced morbidity, neuroinflammation, and brain senescence, linking eNOS to COVID-19-related neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Background Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a significant threat to human health. The virus causes potentially fatal disease of the central nervous system (CNS), for which no treatments are available. TBEV infected individuals display a wide spectrum of neuronal disease, the determinants of which are undefined. Changes to host metabolism and virus-induced immunity have been postulated to contribute to the neuronal damage observed in infected individuals. In this study, we evaluated the cytokine, chemokine, and metabolic alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of symptomatic patients infected with TBEV presenting with meningitis or encephalitis. Our aim was to investigate the host immune and metabolic responses associated with specific TBEV infectious outcomes. Methods CSF samples of patients with meningitis (n = 27) or encephalitis (n = 25) were obtained upon consent from individuals hospitalised with confirmed TBEV infection in Brno. CSF from uninfected control patients was also collected for comparison (n = 12). A multiplex bead-based system was used to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Untargeted metabolomics followed by bioinformatics and integrative omics were used to profile the levels of metabolites in the CSF. Human motor neurons (hMNs) were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and infected with the highly pathogenic TBEV-Hypr strain to profile the role(s) of identified metabolites during the virus lifecycle. Virus infection was quantified via plaque assay. Results Significant differences in proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-α2, TSLP, IL-1α, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-12p40, IL-15, and IL-18) and chemokines (IL-8, CCL20, and CXCL11) were detected between neurological-TBEV and control patients. A total of 32 CSF metabolites differed in TBE patients with meningitis and encephalitis. CSF S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP1) and Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) levels were 2.4-fold (range ≥ 2.3-≥3.2) higher in encephalitis patients compared to the meningitis group. CSF urocanic acid levels were significantly lower in patients with encephalitis compared to those with meningitis (p = 0.012209). Follow-up analyses showed fluctuations in the levels of O-phosphoethanolamine, succinic acid, and L-proline in the encephalitis group, and pyruvic acid in the meningitis group. TBEV-infection of hMNs increased the production of SAM, FBP1 and PEP in a time-dependent manner. Depletion of the metabolites with characterised pharmacological inhibitors led to a concentration-dependent attenuation of virus growth, validating the identified changes as key mediators of TBEV infection. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the neurological disease outcome of TBEV infection is associated with specific and dynamic metabolic signatures in the cerebrospinal fluid. We describe a new in vitro model for in-depth studies of TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis, in which the depletion of identified metabolites limits virus infection. Collectively, this reveals new biomarkers that can differentiate and predict TBEV-associated neurological disease. Additionally, we have identified novel therapeutic targets with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and deepen our understanding of TBEV pathogenesis.

        <tr id="The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of numerous variants with enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. Despite widespread vaccination, infections persist, and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 reprograms host metabolism remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether virus-induced lipid remodeling is conserved across variants and whether changes in lipid abundance correlate with alterations in lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Using global untargeted lipidomics and quantitative proteomics, we analyzed A549-ACE2 cells infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants and compared them to cells infected with the ancestral WA1 strain. In parallel, we conducted quantitative proteomics to assess virus-induced changes in the host proteome. Our results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 drives a remarkably consistent pattern of metabolic rewiring at both the lipidomic and proteomic levels across all three variants. We mapped changes in the expression of host metabolic enzymes and compared these to corresponding shifts in lipid abundance. This integrative analysis identified key host proteins involved in virus-mediated lipid remodeling, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), and ORM1-like protein 2 (ORMDL2).

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the profound and lasting impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system. Beyond acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent, disrupting immune homeostasis and contributing to persistent inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, neuropathy, and mood disturbances. These are linked to immune dysregulation involving cytokine imbalance, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, glial activation, and T-cell exhaustion. Key biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NFL) correlate with disease severity and chronicity. This narrative review examines the immunopathological mechanisms underpinning the neurological sequelae of long COVID, focusing on neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and molecular mimicry. We also assess the role of viral variants in shaping neuroimmune outcomes and explore emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including biomarker-guided and immune-targeted interventions. By delineating how SARS-CoV-2 reshapes neuroimmune interactions, this review aims to support the development of precision-based diagnostics and targeted therapies for long COVID-related neurological dysfunction. Emerging approaches include immune-modulatory agents (e.g., anti-IL-6), neuroprotective drugs, and strategies for repurposing antiviral or anti-inflammatory compounds in neuro-COVID. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities, personalized therapies guided by biomarkers and patient-specific immune profiles may be essential. Advancements in vaccine technologies and targeted biologics may also hold promise for prevention and disease modification. Finally, continued interdisciplinary research is needed to clarify the complex virus–immune–brain axis in long COVID and inform effective clinical management.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the world with a major public health problem, long COVID (LC), which is estimated to affect over 400 million people worldwide. Many unknowns remain regarding the mechanisms involved in LC. We investigated the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and IFN-γ responses on the development of LC and its various phenotypes. We studied a cohort of 137 convalescents following predominantly mild COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave (2020) and up to one-year post-infection. We found 45% of LC cases that were associated with a greater number and duration of acute-phase symptoms. Cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal symptoms in the acute phase were associated to protection against LC development, while pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, musculoskeletal and other symptoms were associated with increased risk of LC development. Regarding LC phenotypes, we observed risk associations and potentially deleterious effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for LC symptoms classified as general or other. In contrast, for vital organ-related LC symptoms, we found only protective associations, particularly for cardiovascular symptoms, which indeed had a low prevalence in LC (16%). Collectively, our data suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies play a protective role against vital organ-related LC symptoms, especially cardiovascular symptoms, but are insufficient in preventing or limiting other highly prevalent LC symptoms, such as neurological, psychiatric and pulmonary.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced excessive inflammatory response is a key contributor to pathology in respiratory viral infections. However, the underlying mechanisms by which viral infection provokes intense inflammatory reaction and how sustained inflammation leads to tissue damage are not fully understood. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as an example, our research demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce PANoptosis in bystander cells, contributing to the persistence of inflammatory responses. Specifically, the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in infected cells leads to the secretion of 2'3'cGMP-AMP, TNF-α, and IFN-β. These molecules activate STING-induced autophagy-mediated ADAR1 degradation, resulting in the accumulation of Z-nucleic acid, which subsequently triggers ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis in bystander cells. Additionally, inhibiting the cGAS pathway or knocking out STING effectively reduces PANoptosis and alleviates the pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus infection in mouse models. Overall, our findings reveal the unexpected role of PANoptosis in bystander cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection as a mechanism driving pathological damage and persistent inflammatory responses. Targeting this process may offer a promising strategy to mitigate tissue damage in COVID-19 as well as other viral infections and inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by β-amyloid (βA) accumulation, neuroinflammation, excessive synaptic pruning, and cognitive decline. Despite extensive research, effective treatments remain elusive. Here, we identify potassium channel-interacting protein 3 (KChIP3) as a key driver of AD pathology using the 5XFAD mouse model. KChIP3 levels were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice, correlating with βA burden and neuroinflammation. This upregulation was triggered by inflammatory signaling via the NLRP3 inflammasome and Caspase-1 activation. Notably, genetic deletion of KChIP3 (5XFAD/KChIP3−/−) markedly reduced βA plaque deposition, pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive gliosis, and expression of inflammation-related proteins (APO, CLU, MDK). Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed restored synaptic markers (CD47, CD200, CACNB4, GDA) and a shift of the disease-associated microglial (DAM-1) phenotype. Mechanistically, we propose that KChIP3 amplifies AD pathology through two key mechanisms: (1) sustaining neuroinflammation by upregulating pro-inflammatory genes and (2) impairing synaptic integrity by repressing genes critical for neuronal function. Consistently, KChIP3 deletion enhanced dendritic complexity, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive performance in 5XFAD mice. These findings position KChIP3 as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction in AD and highlight its potential as a biomarker for disease progression.

The cellular immune response is crucial against SARS-CoV-2, particularly with the emergence of new variants that evade antibody neutralization. This study focuses on the immune memory response in individuals who have been vaccinated with the Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV vaccine. Methods: A cross-sectional study evaluated lymphocyte subpopulations using flow cytometry in 52 vaccinated adults (30 females, 22 males) who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or diagnosed with COVID-19. Conducted from February to June 2023 during the Omicron variant’s circulation, this study assessed antigens—CD154 in CD4+ T cells, CD107 and CD314 in CD8+ T cells, CD314 in NK cells, and CD86 in CD19 B cells—after stimulation with viral peptides and an inactivated virus. Granzyme B and IFN-γ were quantified using ELISA. Results: The memory response, regardless of gender, age, or Body Mass Index (BMI), was mild but significant upon exposure to a viral antigen or inactivated virus. An increase in the secretion of IFN-γ and granzyme B was also observed. Conclusions: It is suggested that the vaccine was able to generate a mild long-term memory against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vaccinated adult individuals, independent of gender and BMI.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), stands as one of the most severe pandemics the world has ever faced in recent times. SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of symptoms, varying from severe manifestations to mild cases and even asymptomatic carriers. This diversity stems from a multitude of factors, including genetic predisposition, viral variants, and immune status. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune system engages pattern recognition receptors, setting off a series of intricate signalling cascades. These cascades culminate in the activation of innate immune responses, including induction of type I and type III interferons. The emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose challenges to the innate immune system defense. Therefore, investigating the innate immune response is crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophoshate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, a critical innate immune mechanism, represents a promising target for intervention at multiple stages to reduce the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review explores innate immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other immune responses critical for SARS-CoV-2 defence. As part of the therapeutic approach, we extend our review to highlight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as emerging and effective therapeutics for controlling SARS-CoV-2 by targeting different stages of the innate immune system. A diverse range of mAbs has been explored to address specific targets within the innate immune pathways. A deep understanding of innate immunity and targeted monoclonal therapeutics will be instrumental in combating viruses and their variants, laying the foundation for enhanced treatment and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculous meningitis is the most severe form of tuberculosis and HIV-1 co-infection worsens the already poor prognosis. However, how Mycobacterium tuberculosis crosses the blood-brain barrier and how HIV-1 influences tuberculous meningitis pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Using human pericytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia alone and combined in an in vitro blood-brain barrier model, we investigated the effect of Mycobacterium tuberculosis +/- HIV-1 co-infection on central nervous system cell entry and function. Cells and the blood-brain barrier model were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and/or HIV-1 and we evaluated the effects of both infection on (i) cells susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its growth in cells by flow cytometry; (ii) modulation of blood-brain barrier permeability and Mycobacterium tuberculosis passage through it; (iii) viral and bacterial cytopathogenicity using the xCELLigence system; (iv) cell metabolic activity and ROS release using colorimetric assays; (v) extracellular glutamate concentration by fluorometric assay; (vi) the inflammatory response by Luminex; and (vii) endoplasmic reticulum stress by quantitative PCR. Results We demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects and multiplies in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. Mycobacterium tuberculosis also induces an increase of the blood-brain barrier permeability resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects include (i) increased markers of cellular stress (mitochondrial metabolic activity, unfolded protein response); (ii) ROS release; (iii) the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes; (iv) and the secretion of the excitotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate. Lastly, we observed distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators. Conclusion These results indicate that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can translocate the blood-brain barrier directly to initiate meningitis.

The specific cause of UC is still not fully understood, but this condition is believed to arise from a combination of environmental, genetic, microbial, and immune factors. This study aimed to explore the specific roles of macrophages and fibroblasts in UC pathogenesis, focusing on their interactions and contributions to disease progression. Methods We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze macrophages and fibroblasts in peripheral blood and colon biopsy samples from UC patients. Bulk RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and flow cytometry and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data were used for validation. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the correlation between cell abundance and disease severity. Results Macrophages and fibroblasts were identified as key communication hubs in UC; specifically, SPP1 + macrophages and CHI3L1 + fibroblasts were significantly enriched at the sites of inflammation. These cells are strongly correlated with disease severity and orchestrate inflammatory responses within the intestinal immune microenvironment, contributing to UC-associated colorectal cancer.

We identify a subset of EGR1+ CD14+ monocytes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This subset activates NF-kB signaling and differentiates into tissue-damaging macrophages, which accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, we identify a CD8+ T cell subset with type II interferon signature in the peripheral blood and the lung tissue of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD), suggesting that chemokine-driven migration of these cells contributes to ILD progression.

Immune dysregulation, particularly involving T cell abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MMD; however, their precise relationship remains unclear. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with MMD and healthy controls were analyzed using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and transcriptomic profiling. Additionally, clinical characteristics and neuroimaging data were collected to perform integrated correlation analyses with immune profiling data. Results Patients with MMD exhibited aberrant T cell activation and altered subset distribution, accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Increased oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress were observed in T cells, along with disease-specific downregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1 and ICOS.

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) includes a uniquely regulated immune response that supports homeostasis, response to injury, and response to pathogens. Recent work has shown that virus-associated immune responses in the CNS may contribute to neuronal injury and long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive decline. However, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate acute infiltration of immune cells from vascular compartments into the CNS are not well defined. Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection. CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells exhibit a bystander, memory phenotype (CD49d+, Tbet+, NKG2D+, Eomes+), are cytotoxic, and are recruited independent of antigen specific responses. We show that infiltration of CD8+ bystander T-cells is supported by microglia and infiltrating macrophage expression of IL-15 and interferon expression in the CNS. These innate antiviral immune signals support activation of bystander CD8+ T-cells in the CNS that contribute to tissue injury independent of virus replication at early time points post-infection. These data support a mechanism by IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T-cells to enter the CNS and contribute to injury independent of antigen-specific stimulation. Importance Prior studies have shown that virus infections in the respiratory and olfactory nerve pathways can result in long term injury in the brain. However, the mechanisms that link virus infection in the olfactory neurons and brain injury are not understood. We show that virus infection of olfactory neurons results in immune stimulation in the brain of resident immune cells to release a cytokine called IL-15 and interferon. This results in infiltration and activation of non-specific T-cells that cause injury of neurons in the brain. This may be an important mechanism by which respiratory viruses and other viruses cause inflammation and injury in the brain.">

        <tr id="The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung has been extensively studied, yet the molecular regulators of host-cell programs hijacked by the virus in distinct human airway epithelial cell populations remain poorly understood. Some of the reasons include overreliance on transcriptomic profiling and use of nonprimary cell systems. Here we report a network-based analysis of single-cell transcriptomic profiles able to identify master regulator (MR) proteins controlling SARS-CoV-2–mediated reprogramming in pathophysiologically relevant human ciliated, secretory, and basal cells. This underscored chromatin remodeling, endosomal sorting, ubiquitin pathways, as well as proviral factors identified by CRISPR assays as components of the viral-host response in these cells. Large-scale drug perturbation screens revealed 11 candidate drugs able to invert the entire MR signature activated by SARS-CoV-2. Leveraging MR analysis and perturbational profiles of human primary cells represents an innovative approach to investigate pathogen-host interactions in multiple airway conditions for drug prioritization.">

        <tr id="Different functional T lymphocytes play important roles in the progression of IAV infection, including proliferation, recruitment, and effector activity. However, the immune changes of T cells during IAV infection are unclear, and the related targets are still to be explored. In this study, we used a multi-omics approach combining transcriptome and single-cell transcriptome analysis to identify TXN as a key target gene and elucidate its close association with T-cell proliferation. From these data, we identified 10 key differential genes through a combination of differential analysis, WGCNA, and Friends analysis and further identified that only TXN and S100A6 co-existed in the highly variable genes of proliferative T cells. Because TXN exhibits highly specific high expression in proliferative T cells, we focused on its related research and ultimately identified it as a target gene for IAV infection. Reports have suggested that simultaneous inhibition of the GSH and TXN pathways can effectively trigger cell death. This proves our hypothesis about a new direction of T cell death in IAV infection. Additionally, we found that T cell development after IAV infection was regulated and altered, but this study did not clearly explain whether it was negative regulation. In summary, we have identified TXN as a target gene involved in T cell proliferation during IAV infection, and we suggest that its expression may be associated with non-apoptotic forms of T cell death.

        <tr id="Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating symptom in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Fresh insights indicate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may undergo neuron-like differentiation, potentially contributing to pain mechanisms. By examining the apolipoprotein E (APOE) together with the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), this study aims to clarify their joint function in modulating differentiation and how this interplay might be implicated in chronic pain associated with NPC. Through comprehensive analysis using TCGA-NPC transcriptomic datasets and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we assessed the molecular landscapes of both NPC-affected and healthy nasopharyngeal tissues. Differential gene expression and immune cell profiling identified macrophages as key players in the inflammatory response. Single-cell sequencing revealed a distinct subpopulation of neuron-like macrophages expressing neurogenesis-related genes. Macrophage-to-neuron-like cell transformation in response to NPC cells was examined through in vitro co-culture systems, highlighting the involvement of the APOE-TREM2 regulatory pathway. In vivo studies involved macrophage depletion and TREM2 knockdown in mouse models to evaluate the impact on chronic pain development. Infiltrating macrophages were significantly more abundant in NPC samples, with many exhibiting neuron-like features that were positively linked to high levels of WNT5 A expression. In vitro, NPC cells induced macrophage differentiation into neuron-like cells, a process regulated by TREM2 and APOE. TREM2 knockdown in macrophages resulted in a reduction of chronic pain behaviors in mouse models, highlighting the contribution of the APOE-TREM2 Axis to NPC-associated chronic pain. Our findings demonstrate that NPC cells promote macrophage reprogramming through the APOE-TREM2 Axis, leading to neuron-like differentiation and contributing to chronic pain in NPC patients. Targeting this pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies for managing chronic pain in NPC. Graphical Abstract 1. Neuron-like macrophages contribute to chronic pain in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through the APOE-TREM2 axis. 2. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a unique subset of macrophages expressing neurogenesis-related genes in NPC tissues. 3. APOE-TREM2 signaling regulates the neuronal-like differentiation of macrophages, promoting pain-related pathways in NPC. 4. Targeting the APOE-TREM2 axis may offer novel therapeutic strategies for alleviating chronic pain in NPC patients.

        <tr id="Introduction The immune and inflammatory responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in the context of long COVID, remain critical areas of study. Understanding these responses is essential for addressing the long-term health impacts of COVID-19. Recent research also highlights the pivotal role of proteases in modulating immune responses and contributing to disease severity, making them a key focus of our analysis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 72 convalescent COVID-19 patients, assessing recovery at three key time points: immediately post-discharge, one month later, and three months post-infection. Additionally, a subset of 15 patients was followed up two years post-COVID-19. Clinical parameters, including demographics, comorbidities, treatment modalities, and COVID-19 severity, were evaluated. Using CyTOF technology, we characterized over 30 immune cell subsets, including granulocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. We also performed multiplexed analyses of blood samples to profile cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and COVID-19-related proteins. Results Our comprehensive approach revealed significant changes in the immune system over time, highlighting the role of specific immune cells and proteases in the recovery process. Key findings include a decreasing deregulatory effect on immune responses exerted by subsequent SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Delta, and Omicron. Conclusion This study provides an in-depth understanding of the molecular dynamics of immune recovery following COVID-19. By integrating clinical profiling, plasma multiplex analysis, antibody profiling, mass cytometry immunophenotyping, in vitro PBMC stimulation, and the role of proteases, we offer valuable insights into the complex interplay of immune, inflammatory, and protease-mediated responses in individuals recovering from COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Impaired spermatogenesis has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on male fertility remains unclear. The purpose of this multicenter study was to investigate the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility and determine the potential reasons leading to impaired male reproductive functions. In silico approach identified ~60 amino acid sequences containing at least five continuous residues shared by SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and spermatogenesis-linked proteins. Four synthetic peptides were tested with sera from independent cohorts of patients with acute and long COVID-19 syndrome (LCS), and naïve vaccinated subjects. Immunogenicity and pathogenicity studies were performed by immunizing mice with two selected peptides and testing the antigenicity of induced antibodies. While none of four peptides were recognized by antibodies from vaccinated people, infected patients exhibited high reactivity to peptide 4, and LCS patients, especially women, showed elevated antibody levels against peptide 2. Women with LCS and chronic fatigue syndrome had higher levels of peptide 2–reacting antibodies than those with idiopathic chronic fatigue syndrome. Noteworthy, peptide 2 antibodies showed, in in vitro experiment, a specific interaction with mouse testicular tissue antigens. These findings raise the possibility that cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and spermatogenesis-related antigens may affect infected patients’ fertility, suggesting a potential for autoimmune responses with human consequences.">

        <tr id="Objectives: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are at high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019. It is unclear whether anti-viral cellular and humoral immunity is impacted in patients with ILD in the presence of immune disorders and immunosuppressive therapy. This results in poor control of viral infections following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to highlight the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We compared viral clearance, antibody levels, and T-cell immune response between healthy controls and patients with connective tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Results: Patients with ILD exhibited a higher viral load than the control group (1.58 × 106 vs. 2.37 × 103 copies/mL, p = 0.018), as well as a significantly lower level of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type (WT) virus (7.01 vs. 625.6, p < 0.0001) and Omicron BA.5 (7.19 vs. 128.4, p < 0.001). Similarly, a lower virus-specific T-cell (VST) immune response was observed 14 days post-symptom onset in the ILD group (CD4+ VSTs: 0.018 vs. 0.082, p = 0.005; CD8+ VSTs: 0.0008 vs. 0.047, p = 0.004). The ILD group had no other heightened inflammatory biomarkers compared with the control group. Conclusions: Our study provides novel evidence of the underlying interaction between virus clearance and host immune status and sheds light on the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Significance Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with severe birth defects, yet the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM-1) and found that they promote ZIKV entry but are downregulated by the virus infection. We identified several ZIKV proteins involved in AXL and TIM-1 down-regulation through an autophagy-mediated process. Mechanistically, this loss of surface receptors protects host cells from superinfection and cell death, while dampening the innate immune response, ultimately promoting viral spread. Our results contribute to a better understanding of ZIKV’s interactions with host cells and offer insight into viral entry, innate signaling, and pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological alterations, ranging from headache and dizziness to severe encephalopathy and inflammatory neurological diseases (IND), and neuropathological findings suggest immune-mediated processes. Therefore, we sought to characterize profiles of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and markers of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis in COVID-19 patients with neurological alterations to identify key factors and mechanisms underlying CNS disturbances in COVID-19. The study included a case series of 52 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations, which were categorized into three groups: isolated refractory headache (n = 14), encephalopathy (n = 24), and IND (n = 14). Individuals with non-inflammatory, non-infectious neurological conditions (n = 9) were included as negative controls. Paired CSF and serum samples were assessed for 56 biomarkers. Regardless of the neurological condition, COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated CSF levels of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-15, IL-25, IFN-α2, CCL7, CCL11, and GM-CSF. Patients with encephalopathy and IND also showed increased IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, neopterin, IL-7, CXCL8, CXCL9, TGF-α, EGF, sTREM-2, and HMGB1, consistent with a CNS cytokine storm. In contrast, individuals with isolated refractory headache showed a modest inflammatory profile, compatible with the limited CNS involvement. COVID-19 patients showed elevated serum IL-13, IL-18, TNF-α, VILIP-1, TGF-α, and VEGF levels, indicating systemic inflammation and potential blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. β-NGF was increased in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, suggesting the activation of neuroprotective responses during patient recovery. Functional protein network analysis showed a significant enrichment of interactions between factors altered in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, many of them related to processes of neuroinflammation and microglial functions, and leukocyte chemotaxis, activation and proliferation. These findings support a model in which both systemic immune activation and localized neuroinflammation contribute to the diversity of neurological outcomes observed in COVID-19, and dysregulated cytokine production, glial activation, inflammasome activity and BBB disturbances represent key factors in neuro-COVID-19 pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease linked with deregulated immune responses, leading to hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis, often with fatal outcomes. Neutrophils play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, with elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts correlating with disease severity. Despite extensive research, the molecular processes associated with neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 remain elusive. Methods To investigate the molecular signatures underlying neutrophil-driven pathology, we conducted transcriptome analysis in neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients versus healthy individuals. To evaluate the specificity of identified neutrophil signatures in COVID-19, we extended our transcriptomic analysis to neutrophils from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a non-infectious fibrotic lung disease. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining was performed on lung biopsy specimens from IPF patients to validate transcriptomic findings at the tissue level. Results Our analysis revealed significant transcriptional changes in COVID-19 neutrophils, particularly in pathways involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and antiviral responses. Additionally, pathways associated with autophagy and chromatin remodeling were upregulated, while translation-related processes were suppressed, indicating an increased predisposition for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release. This neutrophil transcriptional signature in COVID-19 appears to be associated with the previously reported deregulation of the Activin/Follistatin system in the periphery. Notably, a comparative transcriptomic analysis with neutrophils isolated from IPF patients revealed the induction of substantially overlapping inflammatory processes, suggesting common deregulated responses in COVID-19 and IPF. Consistently, significant NET formation, a hallmark of COVID-19-related inflammation, was observed within lung biopsies from IPF patients. Conclusion By delineating both shared and disease-specific molecular pathways, our findings validate the critical role of neutrophils in COVID-19 and IPF pathophysiology, highlighting their involvement in balancing the inflammatory response across diverse lung diseases.

        <tr id="Most genetic variants that confer risk of complex immune-mediated diseases (IMD) affect gene regulation in specific cell types. Their target genes and focus cell types are often unknown, partially because some effects are hidden in untested cell states. B cells play important roles in IMDs, including autoimmune, allergic, infectious, and cancerous diseases. However, despite this established importance, B cell activation states are underrepresented in functional genomics studies. In this study, we obtained B cells from 26 healthy female donors. We stimulated B cells in vitro with six activation conditions targeting key pathways: the B cell receptor (BCR), Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR9, CD40, and a cocktail that promotes differentiation into double negative 2 (DN2) IgD- CD27- CD11c+ CD21- B cells, a likely pathogenic B cell subset for autoimmunity that is also expanded in infectious diseases. We profiled up to 24 human B cell activation states and up to 5 control conditions using RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq coupled with surface protein markers (CITE-seq), and ATAC-seq. We provide an in-depth characterization of how IMD-associated genes responded to stimuli and group into modules with distinct functions. Using high-depth RNA-seq data, we found pervasive splicing effects during B cell activation. Using single-cell data, we describe stimulus-dependent B cell fates. Chromatin data reveal the transcription factors likely involved in stimulus-dependent B cell activation. These open chromatin regions capture a significant proportion of the genetic risk of IMDs and elucidate IMD genetic risk variants with previously unknown function. These data are shared via an interactive browser that can be used to query the dynamics of gene regulation and B cell differentiation during activation by different stimuli, enhancing further investigation of B cells and their role in IMDs.">

        <tr id="The virus known to cause COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, exhibits severe and complex neurological symptoms. These effects may be attributed to a virus-induced neuroinflammatory environment, warranting exploration of the respiratory centers of the brain, namely the pons and medulla, specifically in relation to neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neuronal death in response to COVID-19. Interestingly, older adults with neurological dysfunction maintained on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, such as memantine, had reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate (1) the neuroinflammatory response to COVID-19 in the respiratory centers of the brain, and (2) to assess the extent to which NMDAR antagonists offer neuroprotective measures in the context of COVID-19. In a susceptible mouse model, animals inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 were pre-treated with either memantine or an alternative NMDAR antagonist, ifenprodil. Inoculated animals had poor survival and showed signs of neuroinflammation, evidenced by a reduction in morphological structure, demyelination, and changes in astrocyte and microglial expression in the pons and medulla. Mice pre-treated with memantine showed improved survival when challenged with COVID-19 and a reduction in virus-induced neuroinflammatory impairments. Our findings support the further investigation of memantine for the prevention of COVID-19 induced neuroinflammation and resultant neurological symptoms and shed light on the possible protective mechanism of memantine in the elderly maintained on NMDAR antagonists.">

        <tr id="Many neurological diseases remain difficult to treat, necessitating further elucidation of their pathogenesis. Conditional inactivation of Pdgfra in Nestin-expressing cells leads to the depletion of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha+ (PDGFRα+) oligodendroglial lineage cells responsible for myelination, resulting in forebrain hypomyelination and severe, progressive neurological deficits in neonatal mice. The present study examined the cerebral cortex of these mice to better understand the mechanisms underlying such progressive neurological deficits, that are often observed in refractory neurological diseases. Histological and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses showed that, following activation of meningeal border-associated macrophages (BAMs), PDGFRα+ fibroblasts that escaped gene inactivation were extensively recruited from the meninges into the hypomyelinated subpial cerebral cortex. Transcriptional reprogramming suggested that these fibroblasts originated from the pial fibroblast lineage and adopted a myofibroblast-like transcriptional phenotype. The recruited fibroblasts established stable cell–cell interactions with activated brain macrophages, including BAMs and microglia, accompanied by signaling pathways associated with chronic, tissue-damaging inflammation. Subsequently, inflammatory cortical lesions emerged, characterized by glial activation, angiogenesis, and neuronal oxidative stress. Treatment with a PDGFRα-neutralizing antibody significantly reduced fibroblast recruitment and mitigated glial activation and angiogenesis. These findings suggest that meningeal BAMs and pial fibroblasts are key contributors to the formation of tissue-damaging subpial cortical lesions. The interactions between brain macrophages and pial fibroblasts may contribute to the mechanisms underlying chronic and progressive neurological deficits and represent potential therapeutic targets for refractory neurological diseases.

        <tr id="Background Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition (here abbreviated as post-COVID) is an escalating global health issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of post-COVID following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and anxiety. Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol. Results We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent. Conclusions Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.">

        <tr id="Background: Currently the role of dengue virus (DENV) specific T cell responses in disease pathogenesis and protection are not well understood, including potential differences in those who have obesity. We sought to investigate the functionality and phenotype of T cells in patients with acute dengue fever (DF) or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Methods: T cell function was assessed in patients with DF (n=50) and DHF (n=12), recruited within 4 days of illness and again on day 5 to 7, using 109 peptides representing CD8+ T cell epitopes and 90 peptides targeting CD4+ T cell epitopes. Phenotypic analysis was in DF (n=21) and DHF patients (n=21), recruited between days 6 to 8 since onset of illness, by multicolor flow cytometry. Results: The frequency of ex vivo IFN{gamma} ELISpot responses to both the CD4+ and CD8+ peptides pools significantly increased from the first to second time point in patients with DF (p<0.0001) but not with DHF. The frequency of ex vivo IFN{gamma} ELISpot responses to CD4+ (p=0.001) and CD8+ peptides pools (p=0.0002) also significantly increased from the first to second time point in lean patients compared obese patients. Cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen (CLA) expression was significantly higher in the CD8+ T cell subset in patients with DF and DHF compared to HC and these differences were most significant in CD8+CD45RA- T cells. CD8+CD45RA-CLA+ T cells consisted of >50% of the T cells in 9/21 patients with DHF, with 92.7% expressing CD38. CLA expression was highest in the CD8+CD45RA- of obese individuals, which was significantly higher compared to lean individuals (p=0.01). CD27 and CD127 were both significantly downregulated in patients with DHF compared to DF, with ICOS expression being significantly higher in CD8+ T cells in DHF. Discussion: Patients with DHF and obese individuals had impaired T cell functionality. Activated and skin homing CD8+ T cells were associated with DHF, with downregulation of CD27 and CD127. Therefore, the role of skin homing T cells, which have impaired functionality in disease pathogenesis, should be further investigated.">

        <tr id="The ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants highlights the importance of monitoring immune responses to guide vaccination strategies. Although neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) have garnered increasing attention, T-cells are crucial for conferring long-lasting immunity, especially their resilience against viral mutations. However, assessing T-cell responses clinically has been hindered by cost and complexity. In this study, we recruited a cohort of 134 healthy adults, who had been immunized with three doses of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine. Cellular immunity elicited by a comprehensive array of overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the virus’s structural proteins was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Additionally, a dataset including demographic information, routine blood indices, and immune cell indicators comprising 32 variables was collected. Multivariate analysis revealed age and days post-vaccination as key factors influencing the strength of the T-cell response. Importantly, random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were employed, along with 8 easily accessible indicators to formulate predictive models for the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Besides, these models demonstrated substantial accuracy (r > 0.9) in both the training and testing sets. Our findings offer an efficient and economical methodology for evaluating the T-cell reactions in healthy adults following inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, which is visualizable and easy to use, providing a novel strategy for assessing cellular immunity after vaccination.

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis (VMC), a multifaceted pathological condition predominantly triggered by viral infections, has emerged as a major worldwide healthcare concern due to its intricate pathogenesis and substantial disease burden. Although the centrality of immune dysregulation in driving VMC progression is well-established, the precise identities of distinct immune cell subsets and their molecular mediators governing pathological progression continue to present significant knowledge gaps. Single-cell datasets were integrated using quality control, batch correction, and normalization. The FindAllMarkers function identified marker genes for each cluster. Cell types were annotated based on literature-derived marker genes. DESeq2 was employed to identify differentially expressed genes in T cells. CellChat was used to explore intercellular communication and identify key ligand-receptor signaling pathways. Receiver operating characteristic curves assessed the predictive performance of key factors in a validation cohort. T cells were re-annotated for higher-resolution subtyping, and pseudotime analysis depicted the cell trajectories of T cell subtypes. Integrated single-cell data revealed a comprehensive single-cell atlas of VMC. Mechanistic delineation of T cell as principal pathogenic effectors emerged through multi-omics interrogation incorporating single-cell transcriptomic profiling and pathological trajectory reconstruction; functional genomics analyses further substantiated their cardinal involvement in cardiotropic viral pathogenesis. Additionally, communication analysis highlighted CCL as a critical immune regulatory pathway for T cell interactions in VMC. Significant upregulation of CCL3 was confirmed in the validation cohort, establishing it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for VMC. Pseudotime analysis and re-annotation of T cell subpopulations revealed significant enrichment of T.8EFF.OT1LISO and T.Tregs in VMC. This study identifies T cells as key immune players in VMC, with CCL3 proposed as a novel biomarker for the condition.">

        <tr id="Background Immune-related myocarditis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is a rare immune-related adverse event (irAE) but is characterized by a high mortality rate. However, the specific pathological mechanisms underlying immune-related myocarditis remain largely unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the inflammatory microenvironment within cardiac tissues affected by immune-related myocarditis at the single-cell level to identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on an endomyocardial biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma who developed immune-related myocarditis following treatment with ICIs. Additionally, the scRNA-seq data of heart specimens from deceased donors without cardiovascular diseases were collected and applied as normal control. To validate our findings and assess their specificity to ICI-related pathology, we analyzed mouse scRNA-seq data, including controls, ICI-related myocarditis, viral myocarditis, and autoimmune myocarditis. Results We found elevated proportions of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and fibroblasts in the irAE group, suggesting an intensified inflammatory microenvironment in human immune-related myocarditis. Within the lymphocyte compartment, increased proportions of CD8 + T exhausted cells and CD8 + T proliferative cells were observed in the irAE group. The upregulated differentially expressed genes in myeloid cells in the irAE group were enriched in pro-inflammatory pathways, consistent with the observed metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. CXCL9 + fibroblasts, characterized by the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and enriched in the JAK-STAT and TNFα signaling pathways, were predominantly found in the irAE group. Venous endothelial cells specifically expressing atypical chemokine receptor-1 (ACKR1) interacted with myeloid cells and CXCL9 + fibroblasts through the CXCL signaling pathway, facilitating chemokine transcytosis and leukocyte recruitment. Analysis of murine scRNA-seq data further supported these findings, revealing that exhausted CD8 + T cells and pro-inflammatory fibroblasts were uniquely enriched in ICI-related myocarditis, reflecting its distinct inflammatory microenvironment. Conclusions We elucidated the unique inflammatory microenvironment of immune-related myocarditis at the single-cell level. Our work revealed key cell subpopulations that were significantly implicated in inflammation, thus offering potential therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infections in children lead to symptoms from mild respiratory illness to severe postacute sequelae of COVID-19, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Children (MIS-C). We conducted a metabolic profiling of 147 children’s serum samples, including acute COVID-19 patients, MIS-C patients, and healthy controls. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, we measured 1101 metabolites. The results revealed distinct metabolic profiles in acute COVID-19 and MIS-C patients, with significant alterations in lipid classes. Both conditions exhibited an elevated Apo-B100/Apo-A1 ratio and increased serum inflammatory markers. MIS-C patients showed unique disruptions, including increased triglycerides and altered lipoprotein composition. Despite milder clinical respiratory symptoms, children’s metabolic disturbances mirrored those seen in severe adult COVID-19 patients, indicating a shared inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. This suggests potential long-term health impacts, underscoring the need for continued research into the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 in children.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to human health. The outcome of IAV results from the viral-host interaction, with the underlying molecular mechanisms largely unknown. By integrating the plasma proteomics data of the IAV-infected patients into the viral-inflammation protein-protein interaction (VI-PPI) network created in this study, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), the critical enzyme in purine salvage, was identified as a potential hub gene that connected the different stages of IAV infection. Extended survival rates and reduced pulmonary inflammatory lesions were observed in alveolar epithelial cell (AEC)-specific PNP conditional knockout mice upon H1N1 infection. Mechanistically, PB1-F2 of IAV was revealed as a novel viral transcriptional factor to bind to the TATA box of PNP promoter, leading to enhanced purine salvage in H1N1-challenged AECs. The activation of PNP-mediated purine salvage was verified in IAV-infected patients and A549 cells. PNP knockdown elicited a purine metabolic shift from augmented salvage pathway to de novo synthesis, constraining both viral infection and pro-inflammatory signaling through APRT-AICAR-AMPK activation. Moreover, durdihydroartemisinin (DHA), predicted by VI-PPI as a novel PNP inhibitor, exerted beneficial effects on the survival and weight gain of H1N1-challenged mice via its direct binding to PNP. To reveal for the first time, we found that PNP, activated by IAV, plays a hub role within H1N1-host interaction, simultaneously modulating viral replication and hyperinflammation through purine salvage. Our study sheds new light on a “two-for-one” strategy by targeting purine salvage in combating IAV-related pathology, suggesting PNP as a potential novel anti-influenza host target.">

        <tr id="Introduction Influenza infection is a significant threat to public health, and identifying dynamic biomarkers that influence disease progression is crucial for effective intervention. Methods We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of physiological and pathological parameters in Balb/c mice infected with H1N1 influenza over a 14-day period. We employed the DIABLO multi-omics integration method to analyze dynamic changes in the lung transcriptome, metabolome, and serum metabolome from mild to severe stages of infection. Results Our analysis highlighted the critical importance of intervention within the first 6 days post-infection to prevent severe disease. We identified several novel biomarkers associated with disease progression, including Ccl8, Pdcd1, Gzmk, kynurenine, L-glutamine, and adipoyl-carnitine. Additionally, we developed a serum-based influenza disease progression scoring system. Discussion This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying influenza progression and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The developed scoring system serves as a valuable tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of severe influenza.">

        <tr id="Recurrent COVID-19, defined as two or more distinct episodes, may reflect an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In this case–control study, we compared three groups: individuals with recurrent COVID-19, those with a single episode, and SARS-CoV-2-naïve controls. We genotyped six immune-related SNPs, including TLR7 rs179008, and measured CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens using flow cytometry. The T allele of TLR7 rs179008, previously linked to reduced receptor expression, was significantly overrepresented in the recurrent COVID-19 cohort. At baseline, frequencies of IFN-γ+, IL-2+, and TNF-α+ cells among CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not differ between groups. However, stratification by the rs179008 genotype revealed that T allele carriers displayed diminished IFN-γ production in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and reduced IL-2 production in CD4+ T cells. Following vaccination, T cell responses were comparable across all genotypes. The T allele of TLR7 rs179008 is associated with recurrent COVID-19 and may contribute to impaired T cell-mediated immunity. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanistic role of TLR7 variation in SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk.">

        <tr id="Purpose The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 and RA through immune inflammation. Methods First, we conducted a meta-analysis on the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization rate, and mortality rate for patients with RA. Then, Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate the causal relationship between COVID-19 and RA, and further analyzed the cytokines and immune cells in COVID-19 and RA. Finally, we obtained microarray datasets of COVID-19, RA patients, and normal controls from the GEO database. And performed functional, pathway enrichment, and immune cell infiltration analysis on differentially expressed genes between each group. Results The meta-analysis results suggested that the hospitalization rate and mortality rate of RA patients infected with COVID-19 were higher than those of the control population. MR analysis showed a positive correlation between COVID-19 infection and RA. We also found that interleukin 13 was associated with RA and COVID-19 infection. CD27 on IgD + CD24 + B cells and CD3 on CD39 + CD8 + T cells are common immune cell phenotypes in two diseases. In addition, COVID-19 function is enriched in immune responses mediated by leukocytes and neutrophils, while RA is significantly enriched in the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. The results of immune cell infiltration showed that both diseases had more neutrophils and fewer CD8 T cells. Conclusion There are many similarities between COVID-19 and RA in immune inflammatory responses such as cytokines and immune cells. COVID-19 may lead to the development of RA through immune inflammation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40659-025-00620-7.">

        <tr id="As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, the extent of their impact on shaping population immunity through repeated waves remains poorly understood. This study assessed age-specific immune responses and the effects of vaccination on neutralization against wild-type (WT) and JN.1 variants. We analyzed 4,371 serum samples from individuals aged 6 months–80 years (May-August 2024). We found that 95.1% of participants had detectable anti-N Ig, suggesting widespread prior infection. Among unvaccinated children (6 months–4 years), 96.5% exhibited anti-RBD or anti-N Ig antibodies mostly from asymptomatic infections. Neutralization against JN.1 did not significantly differ by age, but children aged 6 months–4 years exhibited higher JN.1 neutralization than WT, while individuals aged ≥ 12 years showed the opposite pattern. Unvaccinated individuals demonstrated stronger neutralization against JN.1, whereas vaccinated participants had lower neutralization against JN.1 relative to WT, regardless of vaccine dose. No significant differences in JN.1 neutralization were observed across vaccine doses or age groups. Although 86.5% of participants exhibited neutralizing activity against JN.1, the titers remained relatively low. These findings highlight that almost all children experienced asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that natural exposure maintains immunity in adults. Infection-driven boosting may improve community-wide protection and alleviate immune imprinting, offering key insights for optimizing vaccine strategies.

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Long Covid is a post‐viral syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms targeting multiple organ systems after initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Current literature suggests that the mechanisms causing Long Covid involve viral persistence, immune dysregulation, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. By forming reservoirs in the tissues of various organs, SARS‐CoV‐2 may evade immunological clearances while triggering immune responses and contributing to chronic symptoms through cytokine imbalances, T‐cell exhaustion, and systemic inflammation. These symptoms parallel other post‐viral syndromes such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting similar mechanisms of pathology. The coronavirus has also been linked to neuroinflammation and endothelial dysfunction causing cognitive symptoms and cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, its ability to lower energy production links it to post‐exertion malaise (PEM) and muscle pain.

This review synthesizes current data on the mechanisms that drive Long Covid pathogenesis and explores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate viral persistence, immune dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances.

        <tr id="This study investigates the interplay between cellular senescence and inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We employed RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression changes in HUVECs subjected to replicative- or radiation-stress-induced senescence, and we compared these profiles with those of cells under acute or chronic TNFα-mediated inflammation. Our findings reveal that both senescence types exhibited significant upregulation of genes associated with epithelial- (or endothelial) mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammatory pathways, indicating a shared molecular response. Notably, chronic inflammation led to a pronounced EMT signature, while acute inflammation primarily activated classical inflammatory responses. Experimental validation confirmed reduced proliferation and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in senescent and chronically inflamed cells and substantiated the upregulation of EMT marker genes. Additionally, we observed impaired wound healing capacity in senescent and chronically inflamed cells, highlighting the functional consequences of these cellular states. Our study underscores the critical role of inflammation in exacerbating senescence-related changes, contributing to the understanding of age-related cardiovascular pathologies. These insights may inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of aging and inflammation on endothelial function and cardiovascular health.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in millions of deaths globally. Adults with immunosuppression (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients) and those undergoing active cancer treatments experience worse infections and more severe COVID-19. It is difficult to conduct clinical studies in these populations, resulting in a restricted amount of data that can be used to relate mechanisms of immune dysfunction to COVID-19 outcomes in these vulnerable groups. To study immune dynamics after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to investigate drivers of COVID-19 severity in individuals with cancer and immunosuppression, we adapted our mathematical model of the immune response during COVID-19 and generated virtual patient cohorts of cancer and immunosuppressed patients. The cohorts of plausible patients recapitulated available longitudinal clinical data collected from patients in Montréal, Canada area hospitals. Our model predicted that both cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients with severe COVID-19 had decreased CD8 + T cells, elevated interleukin-6 concentrations, and delayed type I interferon peaks compared to those with mild COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, our results suggest that cancer patients experience higher viral loads (however, with no direct relation with severity), likely because of decreased initial neutrophil counts (i.e., neutropenia), a frequent toxic side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, severe cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients suffered a high degree of tissue damage associated with elevated neutrophils. Lastly, parameter values associated with monocyte recruitment by infected cells were found to be elevated in severe cancer and immunosuppressed patients with respect to the COVID-19 reference group. Together, our study highlights that dysfunctions in type I interferon and CD8 + T cells are key drivers of immune dysregulation in COVID-19, particularly in cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world, but our understanding of causation is still lacking. A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD. Methods This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation. Results Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Discussion Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.">

        <tr id="Abstract Arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV), Ross River (RRV), and O’nyong nyong virus (ONNV), are emerging and reemerging viruses that cause disease characterized by fever, rash, and incapacitating muscle and joint pain and inflammation. Alphavirus infection induces robust immune responses, leading to the upregulation of several cytokines and chemokines, including chemokine C ligand 4 (CCL4). CCL4 is a chemoattractant for immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, recruiting these cells to the site of infection, stimulating the release of proinflammatory mediators, and inducing T cell differentiation. CCL4 has been found at high levels in both the acute and chronic phases of chikungunya disease; however, the role of CCL4 in arthritogenic alphavirus disease development remains unexplored. Here, we tested the effect of CCL4 on MAYV infection in mice through antibody neutralization and treatment with recombinant mouse CCL4. We observed no differences in mice depleted of CCL4 or treated with recombinant CCL4 in terms of disease progression such as weight loss and footpad swelling or the development of viremia. CCL4 uses the G protein-coupled receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). To determine whether CCR5 deficiency would alter disease outcomes or virus replication in mice, we inoculated CCR5 knockout (CCR5−−) mice with MAYV and observed no effect on disease development and immune cell profile of blood and footpads between CCR5−/− and wild type mice. These studies failed to identify a clear role for CCL4 or its receptor CCR5 in MAYV infection.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (CD83, LAMP3), lymph node migration (CCR7, ADAM19), and inflammation (TRAF1, IL24) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and systemic immune responses, particularly through the gut–lung axis. Disruptions in gut microbial diversity and function—commonly referred to as dysbiosis—have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we assessed the gut bacteriome and permeability in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using 16S sequencing and ELISA assays, respectively. We also measured blood inflammatory cytokines and fecal secretory IgA to evaluate systemic and mucosal immune responses. Significant alterations in both alpha and beta diversity metrics were observed in patients with COVID-19 (n = 79) and those with post-COVID-19 condition (n = 141) compared to the controls (n = 97). Differential abundance and taxonomic analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles in the infected groups. Increased plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and zonulin were detected in patient samples. Some genera were elevated during acute infection, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia-Shigella were associated with increased zonulin levels, indicating compromised intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that gut dysbiosis may contribute to bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the gut–lung axis and suggest that modulating the gut microbiota could support immune regulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Understanding the intricacies of the host inflammatory response to coronaviruses is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to mitigate the severe consequences of these infections. Various coronaviruses can trigger the host immune response, leading to highly similar inflammatory reactions. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which belongs to the same group of beta-coronaviruses as SARS-CoV-2 and induces high pathogenicity in mice, typically serves as a safety model for investigating highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, replication, and virus-host interactions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) infected with MHV. Results We characterized the global gene changes at both the mRNA and protein levels following viral infection, identifying ten genes involved in various anti-MHV biological processes. Furthermore, by integrating our findings with relevant published data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells, we observed significant similarities in the responses to MHV and SARS-CoV-2, particularly regarding immune and inflammatory responses. Discussion These findings underscore how our research enhances the understanding of global gene expression alterations during coronavirus infection and facilitates the identification of novel antiviral targets.">

        <tr id="Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) remains a global health issue and still drives the development of significant pathology and various comorbidities. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively suppress viral replication but is often initiated months or years after initial infection, leaving a substantial period in which viral replication progresses unchecked. While ART suppresses HIV-1 replication, it does not prohibit the development of HIV-1-associated comorbidities, highlighting a lack of understanding in the connection between replication and HIV-1-associated pathogeneses. Thus, it is critical to better define HIV-1 replication dynamics to more effectively target different stages of the viral replication cycle in distinct cell populations. Here, we show a high-content imaging reporter assay that uses modified human osteosarcoma cells expressing HIV-1 receptors (GHOST cells) which fluoresce in response to HIV-1 infection. These cells have been previously used to assess HIV-1 infectivity and tropism, but this modified assay enables rapid evaluation of large numbers of samples with consistency and replicability, while also easily integrating into existing experimental pipelines that analyze p24 secretion in collected supernatants. This also allows for direct correlation between infectivity and p24 secretion, resulting in a deeper interrogation and more robust understanding of HIV-1 infection kinetics. Institutional Permissions All of the primary cells used in this study were obtained from donors in accordance with Institutional Review Board protocols at the New York Blood Center and Drexel University. All studies using primary cells were performed with cells from deidentified donors and were found by the Institutional Review Board at Drexel University to be exempt from human subjects protocols (protocol number 2208009386). All experiments using in vitro cell lines or primary human cells were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee and at Drexel University. Highlights The current toolkit for evaluating in vitro HIV-1 infection dynamics does not currently include an assay providing direct, efficient assessments of infectivity in large numbers of samples. Direct assessment of viral infectivity longitudinally alongside other measurements of viral infection such as p24 secretion or amount of proviral DNA enables correlation of different stages of viral replication efficiency over time. The high-content viral titer assay described here correlates with widely used surrogate measures of viral infectivity, such as p24 secretion, and integrates easily into existing experimental pipelines that collect supernatant from infected cultures. Adapting fluorescent reporter assays to a high-content imaging and analysis pipeline creates a high-throughput assay of direct infectivity that enables evaluation of changes in infectivity across multiple treatments or timepoints and integrates easily into existing experimental pipelines that collect supernatant from infected cultures.">

Gpnmb gene knockout inhibited macrophage-mediated efferocytosis and impaired skeletal muscle regeneration.

The pathogenesis of this persistent post Covid-19 Condition (PCC) is, however, largely unknown. We hypothesized that persistent T cell activation and exhaustion play a role in PCC development. Methods We examined plasma levels of soluble (s) CD25, TIM-3 and LAG-3, all markers of T cell activation/exhaustion, by enzyme immunoassays in 170 home-isolated and 53 hospitalized patients for up to 18 months after COVID-19 in relation to persistent symptomatology. Results Our major findings were: (i) Cases with persistent dyspnea and fatigue had markedly higher sCD25 at 6–18 months with a more modest increase in sTIM-3. (ii) Cases with memory problems at 12–18 months had increased sLAG-3 iii) sCD25 correlated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and microneutralization titers only in cases with PCC while sTIM-3 correlated with these parameters irrespectively of symptoms. iv) Although hospitalized patients had markedly elevated levels of T cell activation/exhausting markers during follow-up, there was no relation to PCC symptoms. Conclusion Our study indicates a role for T cell activation/exhaustion in PCC following home isolated COVID-19 infection, with somewhat different patterns of sCD25, sTIM-3 and sLAG-3, but not in hospitalized COVID-19 patients where disease severity may be more important.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and often exhibit reduced vaccine efficacy due to chronic immunosuppression. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, understanding immune responses following natural infection remains critical for informing protection strategies in this vulnerable population. We conducted a longitudinal study of SOT recipients who had recovered from Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 infection, evaluating immune responses to the JN.1 subvariant at 4-6 weeks and 1 year postinfection.


METHODS
Neutralizing antibodies to JN.1 were measured using a pseudovirus neutralization assay, and JN.1-specific T-cell responses were assessed by flow cytometry. Frequencies of bulk T-cells and innate immune cells, identified via flow cytometry, and their correlation with adaptive responses were also analyzed.


RESULTS
At 4-6 weeks, 30% of participants had detectable JN.1-neutralizing antibodies, rising to 43% at one year, although titers remained low. In contrast, CD4⁺ T-cell responses were robust and detected in 75%-83% of participants at 4-6 weeks, increasing to 75%-93% by 1 year. CD8⁺ T-cell responses were observed less frequently. Exploratory correlations between innate and bulk T-cell subsets with heterologous adaptive immune responses were investigated but did not reveal statistically significant relationships.


CONCLUSION
These findings offer important insights into the durability and breadth of immunity following natural infection in immunocompromised transplant recipients. While heterologous neutralizing antibodies were limited, sustained CD4+ T-cell responses may help mitigate severe disease following exposure to JN.1-derived variants, which continue to dominate the SARS-CoV-2 landscape.">

        <tr id="Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with new-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The overall goal of this study is to uncover how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD to inform the identification of at-risk patients and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Transcriptomics analysis of 43 PD pathogenic genes was conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID-19 patients with varying severity including 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU, and 17 ICU patients, compared to 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The study shows that COVID-19 severity gradient differentially dysregulates PD pathological genes. Dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients was identified as the convergent network of COVID-19—PD interactions. These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system in ICU COVID-19 patients. A potential synergistic co-expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes was observed in ICU patients, indicating a possible overlap in biological pathways. Dysregulation of the PD pathopharmacogene, SLC6A3 was observed in ICU patients, suggesting potential COVID-19-gene-drug interactions. Nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes, which could advance studies on PD, including diagnosis, pathogenesis, and the development of disease-modifying treatments. Outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients may face a higher risk of developing new-onset PD, whereas ICU COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19-gene-drug interactions.

        <tr id="T lymphocytes infiltrate the CNS in response to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and form a pool of long-lived brain tissue-resident memory T-cells (bTRMs), which display markers of residency (i.e., CD103, CD69, CD49a). However, the functional role of these bTRMs is still unknown. By 30 days postinfection, a latent viral brain infection was established, as indicated by absence of viral transcripts (IE1, E1, and gB) produced during productive infection. Following intracerebroventricular injection of either depleting α-CD8 Ab (clone YTS169.4) or α-CD103-sap (clone IT50) into the brain, 90–95% T-cell depletion was achieved. Using luciferase-expressing mice, we observed recommenced imaging signals indicative of de novo MCMV IE promoter activity in depleted animals. Surprisingly, using an explant assay, we efficiently recovered reactivatable, infectious virus from untreated, latent animals, but not from those depleted of bTRMs (viral recovery in explants was reduced from 100% to 50% by day 21). We identified Lgals3 (galectin 3), Gpnmb (glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B) and Hmox1 (heme oxygenase 1) as genes that were most upregulated in bTRM-depleted groups. When bTRMs were depleted, there was transient expression of viral IE genes which resulted in antiviral microglia with a phagocytic, disease-associated (DAM) or neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype. These data provide new insights into the role of bTRMs in controlling both CNS reactivation and driving microglial phenotypes.">

        <tr id="Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the progressive loss of neurons, leading to a decline in specific brain functions. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the most prevalent, affecting approximately 60 million people worldwide. The pathogenesis of these diseases is complex, combining inflammatory, oxidative, and excitotoxic processes that result in neuronal dysfunction and death. Despite recent advances, there is currently no cure for AD and PD. Available therapies demonstrate limited efficacy, highlighting the continuing need for novel therapeutic approaches. Ergolide, a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone from the Inula brittanica plant, has shown immunoregulatory properties in systemic immune cells and potential applications in certain cancers. This study examines whether the therapeutic effects of ergolide extend to the brain. We explored its mechanisms of action in vitro, and its capacity to restore behavioural integrity in zebrafish models of inflammation and neurotoxicity in vivo. We report the ability of ergolide to attenuate inflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production from microglia in response to toll-like receptor activation. We further propose a role for the NFκB and cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) pathways in ergolide-mediated regulation of microglial activation. Ergolide did not protect against oxidative-induced neuronal death in vitro or mitigate seizure activity in zebrafish. Instead, we revealed a pro-oxidant and cytotoxic effect on neuroblastoma cells. Importantly, ergolide improved survival and alleviated the dysfunction in sensorimotor behaviour in a zebrafish model of inflammation. Our findings reveal a neuroprotective effect of ergolide, likely stemming from its immunoregulatory capacity. We also support further investigation of the CysLT pathway as a therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory-related disease.">

        <tr id="The viral hemorrhagic fevers Ebola and Lassa fever are endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa. Both viruses are characterized by high case fatality risk and lifelong debilitating sequelae including blindness and deafness. However, despite these findings the mechanisms of disease and pathogenesis through which these viruses act remain poorly understood. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize known data regarding both acute and chronic immune-inflammatory dysfunction. A comprehensive search strategy was conducted from July 2022- August 2024. A total of 1,587 articles were identified and evaluated for inclusion. In total 49 Ebola specific and 31 Lassa fever articles were included in this review. The results of this study found considerable dysregulation in immune-inflammatory homeostasis. Specifically, Ebola was found to induce increased concentrations of molecules associated with immune cell recruitment and migration during acute disease. In addition, the virus led to reduction in innate cell populations and expansion of T-cell population frequencies across disease outcomes. Studies of Lassa fever also demonstrated considerable immune dysregulation. However, given the relative lack of studies the exact mechanism of disease is unclear. Among disease survivors, both viruses demonstrate persistent chronic immune dysregulation years following disease onset. However, associating these findings with post-viral syndromes is controversial.">

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a complex, multifactorial condition characterized by persistent symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks following acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, but chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and viral persistence are increasingly being implicated. This study investigated the immunopathological drivers of long COVID-19 and their associations with clinical manifestations and organ damage. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 200 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-65 years, in which immune markers, autoantibody profiles, lymphocyte dysfunction, and imaging findings were assessed over a 12-month period. Persistent inflammation was observed, with elevated interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α ± levels correlated with lung fibrosis and cognitive impairment. Autoantibodies were detected in 40% of the participants, particularly those with cardiovascular and neurological symptoms. A significant reduction in CD8+ T-cell counts was associated with severe fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, whereas persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in 10% of cases, primarily in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms. Imaging studies revealed multiorgan involvement, with structural abnormalities in the lungs, heart, and brain. These findings highlight the interplay of immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity in long-term COVID-19, underscoring the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to address its long-term health impacts.">

        <tr id="A series of hyper immune responses as combined reaction of innate and adaptive immunity may lead to cytokine storm prolonging sickness and causing severities among patients of respiratory infection in general and attack COVID-19 patients in particular. We measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines viz. TNF-alpha, Interleukin-6 and Interferon-gamma. The initiation of immune system against viral infection involves role of cytokines. In Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, high levels of cytokine were observed which led to severity in immune-compromised patients, elderly and even mildly infected patients. High levels of cytokines have not only been observed in SARS-CoV-2 but are also prevalent in other human coronavirus infections. There are other respiratory diseases occurring in the form of epidemics and outbreaks in all parts of the world, yet understanding of the fact that when system gets infected by more than one respiratory virus, the cytokine expression observed has not been looked upon.

This is irrespective of the fact that antibodies may already be present against respiratory diseases within the system over the course of time. We hereby hypothesise that if cytokine storm due to such condition may lead to activation of Th1/Th2 response, develop severity/complications and ultimately may lead to lung damage. In this study, we measured the cytokine response profiles (TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 and IFN-gamma) in patients with respiratory viral infections and we observed that TNF-α is the main factor contributing to cytokine storm and that hyper innate immune response is brought by mucosal immunity during infection by SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Although COVID-19 was originally considered a respiratory illness, it is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have far-reaching impacts on the nervous system. Neurological symptoms such as chemosensory dysfunction are frequently observed during acute infection and approximately 10% of COVID-19 cases will go on to develop new or persistent long-term symptoms, a condition known in the literature as post-acute symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC) or by the patient-coined term Long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The emergence of Long COVID has prompted renewed interest in the study of post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), particularly in the area of neuroimmune interactions. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the current body of literature on neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Long COVID, with an emphasis on neuroimmune mechanisms drawn largely from autopsy studies and animal models. A more complete understanding of neuroimmune crosstalk in Long COVID will not only guide the development of therapies for this highly disabling condition but will also contribute to our general understanding of neuroimmune interactions in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Introduction There are significant challenges remain in accurately categorizing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients. Objectives We used an untargeted 1H NMR-based metabolomics to assess the metabolomic changes in serum samples from a Danish cohort of 106 COVID-19-infected patients with mild to fatal disease courses and from patients with fatal outcomes from other diseases. Methods In total, 240 serum samples were used for this study. We used the data for multiple analyses (1) to construct a predictive model for disease severity and outcome, (2) to identify prognostic markers for subsequent disease severity and outcome, and (3) to understand the disease consequences in the metabolome and how recovery or death is reflected in the altered biological pathways. Results Our results revealed distinct alterations in the serum metabolome that could differentiate patients with COVID-19 by severity (mild or severe) or outcome (death or survival). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and four machine learning algorithms (random forest, linear support vector machine, PLS-DA, and logistic regression), we identified two biomarker sets with relevant biological functions that predict subsequent disease severity and patient outcome. The range of these severity-associated biomarkers was equally broad and included inflammatory markers, amino acids, fluid balance, ketone bodies, glycolysis-related metabolites, lipoprotein particles, and fatty acid levels. Conclusions Our data suggest the potential benefits of broader testing of these metabolites from newly diagnosed patients to predict which COVID-19 patients will progress to severe disease and which patients will manifest severe symptoms to minimize mortality.

        <tr id="Recent research has proposed several host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection and involved in the inflammatory response. Among these, members of the human serpin family and PAR2 have been suggested to play a relevant role. As it has been shown that one of the multiple activities of protease inhibitor SerpinB3 is the activation of PAR2, we have modulated the expression of these two molecules on both human bronchial and hepatic cells and assessed cell surface Spike binding and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our findings indicate that both SerpinB3 and PAR2 play a pivotal role in viral infection and downregulate the expression of interferon-γ, a cytokine with a well-known antiviral effect. These results underscore the potential of the SerpinB3-PAR2 axis as a target for antiviral therapy and provide support for addressing serpins as targets for this purpose.">

        <tr id="In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a systemic host response to infection with life-threatening consequence which ranks among the top ten causes of death worldwide. Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular and cellular impact of sepsis remains rudimentary. Methods A mouse sepsis model was established through LPS induction and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect T helper 1 (Th1) cell subsets and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in septic mice. Additionally, in vivo neutralization experiments were conducted to block IFN-γ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, to explore the regulatory effect of DOCK2 on septic mice. Finally, the regulatory mechanism of DOCK2 was analyzed using an in vivo RNA-seq system. Results We identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a critical downregulating factor for LPS signal pathways. DOCK2-deficient mice were highly sensitive to LPS-induced sepsis and E. coli sepsis with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-γ which were mainly due to hyperresponsive Th1 cells. Ulteriorly, we verified the vital role of DOCK2-mediated Th1 cells in sepsis by neutralizing both IFN-γ and CD4 and found both of which blockade reduced the severity of sepsis in Dock2−/− mice. Mechanically, DOCK2-mediated cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling act in concert to govern peripheral Th1 cell fate. Conclusion Our data indicates that DOCK2 acts as a protective role in regulating systemic inflammation and multi-organ injury in bacterial sepsis by constraining Th1 response. These findings provide new targets for immunomodulatory therapy of sepsis, suggesting that targeting the DOCK2-Th1 axis may become a new strategy to improve systemic inflammatory responses associated with bacterial infections.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to persistent or newly emerging symptoms lasting for months, a condition known as long COVID (LC). The pathophysiology of LC remains poorly understood, with cytokine dysregulation proposed as a key mechanism, although findings across the studies have been inconsistent. Patients and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study using the Olink® Target 96 Inflammation Panel to assess cytokines in COVID-19 (COV) patients at three months and six months post-infection. These profiles were compared with those of individuals recovering from other upper respiratory tract infections (non-COV). Additionally, we analyzed differences between individuals with LC and those who recovered from COVID-19. Predictive models for LC at three months and sixth months post-infection were developed using inflammatory markers and relevant clinical cofactors, including gender, age, BMI, hemogram, Β2-microglobulin, D-dimers, LDH, AST, ALT, Ferritin, vitamin D, CRP, and the severity of acute COVID-19 infection as classified by WHO criteria. Results: We observed a general decline in inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients over time, with only a few cytokines elevated (CCL4 at month 3 and CST5 at month 6) compared to non-COV controls. In LC patients, an early phase of low-grade inflammation transitioned into significant reduction in proinflammatory biomarkers compared to recovered individuals. Rather than indicating immune normalization, this pattern suggests a possible suppression or exhaustion of the immune response in the months following acute infection. Importantly, our predictive modeling demonstrated that this specific cytokine signature, in combination with acute disease severity and clinical cofactors, described well the presence of LC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inflammation-related biomarker dysregulation following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection evolves dynamically over a six-month period. By the sixth month, compared to the third month, the presence of LC is more accurately predicted by a combination of persistent biomarker alteration and the severity of the initial infection, as defined by WHO criteria. This represents a novel insight, as previous studies have primarily associated LC with elevated proinflammatory markers, whereas our results suggest that immune suppression or exhaustion may play a more prominent role in the later stages.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lipid metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of acute viral infections by affecting viral replication and the host immune response. In contrast, the role of host lipid metabolism during chronic viral infection has been less explored. The current study aims to define the role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a primary physiologic receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), during natural gammaherpesvirus infection. Gammaherpesviruses are highly prevalent cancer-associated pathogens that induce and manipulate germinal center responses to establish life-long infection of B cells. Importantly, gammaherpesvirus-infected germinal center B cells are thought to be the target of viral transformation. In this study, we found that global SR-BI deficiency led to increased gammaherpesvirus lytic gene expression in the lungs during the acute stage of infection. Chronic gammaherpesvirus infection of the SR-BI-deficient host was associated with exaggerated germinal center responses and increased differentiation of self-reactive B cells that persisted during the long-term stage of chronic infection. Interestingly, SR-BI-deficient germinal center B cells, although more numerous, failed to support efficient gammaherpesvirus infection. The exaggerated germinal center response was also observed following immunization of the SR-BI-deficient host, unveiling the novel role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of physiological and gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center responses. IMPORTANCE Lipid metabolism affects diverse acute viral infections. In contrast, less is known about the effect of lipid metabolism on chronic virus infection, including in the context of an intact host. Host lipid homeostasis is maintained via a combination of endogenous lipid synthesis that takes place in most cell types and cellular interaction with exogenous, circulating lipids. This study focuses on defining the interaction between SR-BI, a primary HDL receptor, and natural gammaherpesvirus infection. We found that SR-BI deficiency led to increased expression of lytic gammaherpesvirus genes during acute gammaherpesvirus replication in the lungs. Importantly, chronic gammaherpesvirus infection unveiled the physiological role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of the germinal center response, a B cell differentiation process that is critical for physiological B cell responses and that is manipulated by gammaherpesviruses to establish chronic infection.

        <tr id="The evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its impact on public health continue to demand attention as the virus continues to evolve, demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt to diverse selective pressures including immune responses, therapeutic treatments, and prophylactic interventions. The SARS-CoV-2 variant landscape remains dynamic, with new subvariants continuously emerging, many harboring spike protein mutations linked to immune evasion. In this study, we characterized a panel of live SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those key subvariants implicated in recent waves of infection. Our findings revealed a significant variability in mutation patterns in the spike protein across the strains analyzed. Commercial antibodies and human convalescent plasma (HCoP) samples from unvaccinated donors were ineffective in neutralizing the most recent Omicron subvariants, particularly after the emergence of JN.1 subvariant. Using human airway epithelial cells derived from healthy bronchiolar tissue (hBAEC), we established both monoinfections and coinfections involving SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus H1N1 (IFAV_H1N1) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Assessments were conducted to compare viral infectivity and the production and release of immune mediators in the apical and basolateral compartments. Notably, Omicron KP.3.1.1 subvariant induced a more pronounced cytopathic effect in hBAEC compared to its parental strain JN.1 and even surpassed the impact observed with the ancestral wild-type virus (WA1/2020, Washington strain). Furthermore, the coinfection of KP.3.1.1 subvariant with IFAV_H1N1 or RSV did not attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity; instead, it significantly exacerbated the pathogenic synergy in the lung epithelium. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-β, and IL-10 were upregulated in hBAEC following SARS-CoV-2 monoinfection with recent Omicron subvariants as well as during coinfection with IFAV_H1N1 and RSV. Taken together, our findings offer new insights into the immune evasion strategies and pathogenic potential of evolving SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, as well as their interactions with other respiratory viruses, carrying important implications for therapeutic development and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="Unresolved inflammation and fibrosis are the two key features of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive form of steatotic liver disease that can evolve into cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although innate immunity has been well studied in MASH, the role of CD4⁺ T cells remains underexplored despite their potential to coordinate immune responses by providing help to other immune cells, promoting inflammation, or regulating immune activity through effector and regulatory subsets. To better understand the role of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of MASH, we comprehensively characterized hepatic CD4+ T cells in murine and human MASH at a single-cell protein, transcriptional, and functional level. Mass cytometry and CITE-sequencing revealed a marked shift in intrahepatic CD4⁺ T-cell composition in MASH, with enrichment of Th1, regulatory, and cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells. Similar phenotypic changes were mirrored in the peripheral blood and validated in human MASH samples. Functional assays demonstrated increased production of IFNγ and TNFα by hepatic CD4⁺ T cells, highlighting their proinflammatory effector activity. Transcriptomic profiling identified Tnfrsf4 (OX40) upregulation in hepatic CD4⁺ T cells during MASH. Therapeutic blockade of the OX40L-OX40 axis reversed hepatic fibrosis and improved histologic disease scores in mice with established MASH, and also decreased inflammatory markers in a human ex vivo liver model. Together, these studies provide a proteogenomic single-cell atlas for hepatic CD4⁺ T cells and uncover a CD4⁺ T cell-dependent immunopathogenic circuit as a promising immunotherapeutic target to alleviate MASH and liver fibrosis.">

Alongside the viral factors host factors like Age, deregulation of the immune response and presence of comorbidity determine the patient’s outcome. Here we sought to assess the impact of age on natural antibody response, CBC-based inflammatory markers, and outcome of COVID-19 patients. We divided the participants into three groups, young (≤ 35 years), middle-aged (40–60 years), and old (≥ 65 years) patients and collected and analyzed sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. We found that elderly patients showed higher (P < 0.05) levels of inflammation like increased neutrophil percentages, NLR, lymphopenia, and low Hgb levels, compared to middle-aged and young patients. Interestingly these markers were also associated with mortality of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in ion concentration, lipid profile, and coagulation test between the three age groups. We also found that elderly patients showed significantly (P < 0.05) decreased levels of natural antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the two groups. Lastly, we assessed the effect of dexamethasone treatment, even if statistically not significant (P > 0.05) we observed a positive trend among patients under dexamethasone in the aspect of decreasing inflammatory markers. To conclude we showed that SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by an age-dependent deregulation of inflammatory markers that are associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients.

        <tr id="Life-threatening severe dengue (SD) develops in a small subset of patients suffering from dengue fever (DF), a febrile disease that develops following infection with dengue virus (DENV). DENV is a mosquito-borne positive -sense RNA virus. The rapid spread of DENV vectors, which was exacerbated by climate change and inadequate control measures, has led to outbreaks affecting millions worldwide. There is no specific treatment for DF, and the recently introduced vaccines are ineffective in containing the current outbreaks. Like many other viral diseases, the immune system plays a key role in dengue pathogenesis. The lack of models replicating the disease’s immunopathological features has hampered the understanding of the immune system’s role in developing this disease. Recent advances, such as single-cell approaches, provide better systems and methodologies to study the role of different immune cells in SD, closing this gap and providing a better mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis and promoting the identification of targets for therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused a global public health crisis, with a significant impact on multiple body systems. This virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, shows ~80% genomic similarity to SARS-CoV and ~50% genomic similarity to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The spike (S) protein plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the virus, as it facilitates its entry into host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In addition to the respiratory system damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a variety of gastrointestinal (GI), neurological, cardiovascular (CV), ocular, renal, etc. clinical manifestations. Neurological complications, such as anosmia, ague, headache, encephalitis and cerebrovascular events, were frequently observed, being attributed to both direct viral invasion and a very strong systemic inflammatory response. GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common and may occur independently of respiratory symptoms, and the presence of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) detected in fecal samples suggests possible fecal-oral transmission. The CV system is affected by myocardial damage, inflammation and coagulation disorders, with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. At the ocular level, the virus was identified in ocular secretions, and conjunctivitis, uveitis and episcleritis were observed in about 11% of patients. Renal involvement, manifested by acute kidney injury, was detected in 0.5–7% of cases. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to respiratory tract involvement but also has significant systemic implications.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cerebral cytokinopathies are key examples of dysregulated cytokine responses. While mouse models with targeted production of individual cytokines have been pivotal in establishing a causal link between cytokines and disease— especially in the central nervous system—they often fail to replicate the complex inflammatory environments seen in various neuropathological conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, where multiple cytokines are upregulated. Methods To address this, we developed a novel mouse model, GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice, by combining transgenic mice with astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 (GFAP-IL6 mice) and IFN-α (GFAP-IFNlo mice). Results Our findings reveal that chronic, low-level production of IFN-α, below the typical disease-inducing threshold, significantly accelerates disease progression in GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice compared to GFAP-IL6 mice. The double transgenic mice exhibited progressive ataxia, persistent seizure-like episodes, and reduced survival. Remarkably, the clinical and pathological symptoms remained predominantly IL-6-driven and required the presence of adaptive immune cells. Conclusion In summary, we demonstrate that subclinical levels of IFN-α can markedly exacerbate IL-6-mediated neurological disease, suggesting that future studies, should consider the combined effects of IL-6 and IFN-α.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory route. Following intranasal instillation, VSV moves along the axons of olfactory sensory neurons to the olfactory bulb. While within the olfactory bulb the spread of the virus is controlled by microglia activation and the recruitment of peripheral leukocytes, some of the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we used mice with conditional deletions of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an adaptor for RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling. By selectively deleting MAVS in neurons, astrocytes, or long-lived myeloid cells, we discovered that RLR signaling specifically within brain-resident myeloid cells is crucial for protection against the virus. Infected mice with a MAVS deletion in these myeloid cells showed normal myeloid cell and leukocyte infiltration into the brain. However, the P2RY12+ microglia showed aberrant expression of genes involved in antigen cross-presentation. Furthermore, flow cytometry experiments revealed diminished MHC class I expression on MAVS deficient microglia. Moreover, CNS infiltrating CD8+ T cells had dysfunctional transcriptional profiles.

        <tr id="Background A number of studies have shown that methylomes of blood cells of COVID-19 patients display infection-related methylation changes. Those methylation abnormalities were associated with clinical outcomes of the infection and, thus, can potentially be utilized as biomarkers in clinical COVID-19 management. However, a number of parameters need to be assessed, before a clinical use of a biomarker candidate is proposed, with the most important one being reproducible detection in independent target populations. Methods We benchmarked data reported in publications investigating genome-wide methylation changes occurring in blood cells during SARS-CoV-2 virus infection to assess potential applicability of these changes as biomarkers in clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Results We identified nine studies, in which infection-related genome-wide methylation changes in blood cells of COVID-19 patients were reported and associations of those changes with outcomes of the infection was assessed. Our benchmarking analysis showed that each of those studies included patients with different clinical characteristics and each study utilized different symptoms assessment criteria. Most importantly, no uniform data analysis methodologies to identify virus-related methylation changes were used in the analyzed studies. Consequently, analyzed studies, except for one, which was based on uniform data analysis workflow applied across independent patient cohorts, reported sufficiently uniform results that would allow to propose the use of the identified infection-related methylation changes as biomarkers for clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions Due to lack of coherence between studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 associated methylation changes in blood, the potential use of already reported methylation changes as biomarkers for clinical management of COVID-19 patients needs to be further assessed in rigorously controlled studies. At the same time unified data analysis framework appears to be the most critical in development of biomarkers associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and Monkeypox (Mpox) are viral infections that have similar modes of presentation, diagnosis and treatment strategies. Understanding their co-infection dynamics and immune response is important for public health policies. Aim This article aims to determine the relationship between dynamicity and immune response interactions between Mpox and COVID-19, focusing more on the implications for disease severity, viral transmission, and vaccine efficacy. Methodology An extensive literature review was conducted through electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science from the last decade (2014–2024) using keywords: COVID-19, Co-infections, Immune response, Monkeypox, and Vaccination. Results Several co-infections between COVID-19 and Mpox have been reported, especially a case from Florida, in the United States of America (USA), in Barcelona, Spain (a 56-year-old man who suffered both Mpox and COVID-19 and syphilis simultaneously, and from Italy (a 36-year-old male). Both COVID-19 and Mpox have been shown to have some effects on the immunity of a person, especially the innate system, which can occasionally produce inadvertent effects. A common factor that links the two diseases is the endoglycosidase named Heparanase (HPSE). Both COVID-19 and Mpox clinical features have bizarre severity and complications. The rising co-infection of COVID-19 and increased Mpox infection rate has led to the development of only approved vaccines JYNNEOS and COH04S1. Conclusion Global efforts such as adequate awareness campaigns through webinars, social media platforms, and research, including experimental studies, cohort studies, case series, etc., should be put in place to give more insights into both diseases. Such efforts should be backed up with good political will, adequate funding, the establishment of research facilities and interprofessional measures among the concerned countries and policymakers in the world.">

        <tr id="Introduction Microvascular injury is central to the pathophysiology of sepsis, but its interaction with the immune system in early infection is unclear. This study aimed to phenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from emergency department (ED) patients with suspected bacterial infection and correlate the results with microvascular changes. Methods This prospective observational study included 49 adult ED patients with suspected infection and 17 healthy controls. Capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions were measured by sublingual microscopy, while peripheral blood immune cell subsets were analyzed by deep flow cytometry. Results Network visualization of 72 diIerentially regulated parameters revealed specific changes in diIerent immune cell subsets. Innate immune changes included a functional diversion of monocytes towards pathogen defense and tissue repair, whereas adaptive immune changes included the development of CD4+ T cells with Th2-profile and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct immune endotypes: E1 with a suppressed immune response and higher disease severity, and E2 with an enhanced immune response and lower disease severity. Patients showed significant reductions in capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions, which were neither correlated in magnitude nor associated with endotypes. There was a strong association between damaged glycocalyx and several monocyte and T-cell subsets. This association was not observed for capillary density. Discussion We demonstrate that glycocalyx damage is associated with a unique immunological signature, distinct from functional capillary density. These findings provide a strong basis for future studies of immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction in infection.">

        <tr id="Immune cell activation is a feature of COVID-19, that leads to cytokine storm which causes neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, related to psychiatric symptoms due to the depletion of neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate which play a major role in adult neurogenesis. ACE2 receptors are expressed in the hippocampus and decreased neurogenesis in this region is a major factor behind the neuropsychiatric disorders. SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain indirectly through neuroinflammation and altered neurochemical signaling and even mild COVID-19 infections can lead to sustained microglial activation, which disrupts neural networks and impairs cognitive function. The long COVID-19 may be associated with cognitive dysfunction in those who recovered and immunological response may affect synaptic pruning and reduced anterior cingulate cortex volume at one year after COVID-19. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or PASC, commonly known as Long COVID is a significant public health concern and "brain fog" is one of the most debilitating cognitive impairments, affecting memory, concentration, and executive function occurring in 88% of cases. Brain fog may be linked to persistent changes in neurotransmitter levels, particularly involving dopamine and serotonin which play an essential role in cognition, attention, and emotional regulation. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the chemokine CCL11, is linked to cognitive impairments in patients with persistent symptoms. Neuroprotective agents that support neuronal health, such as antioxidants and mitochondrial enhancers and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic and direct current enhance cortical excitability are investigated in cognitive recovery. Evaluation of the currently predominant VUM (a Variant Under Monitoring), LP.8.1, and the most recently designated NB.1.8.1, is increasing as 10.7% of global sequences reported recently due to minor mutations in spike protein.

        <tr id="Objective The innate immune response of an infected host is an essential defense mechanism to fight influenza virus infections in the respiratory tract. This response is essential to limit virus replication and spread. However, an exacerbated response may cause severe immune-pathologies. Therefore, it is very important to better understand innate immune responses at the level of its molecular networks in the context of viral infections. Data We infected human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and human monocytic (THP-1) cells with H3N2 influenza virus A virus and performed transcriptome analysis using next generation RNA sequencing at various times post infection. We report raw sequence data and normalized log2 transformed gene expression values. This data will allow researchers in the field to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways between the two cell types and over times post infection. Furthermore, our data enables comparisons to molecular studies performed in humans and animal models in the context of respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Rat post-mitotic septal neurons, engineered to reversibly proliferate and arrest under physiological conditions, can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine representative independent cDNA libraries were made to evaluate global arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses, e.g., upregulated interferon (β-IFN) RNA, that were previously identified in normal uninfected and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent (CJ) infected septal neurons. This reversible cell model encompassed a non-productive latent (CJ−) and a highly infectious (CJ + , 10 logs/gm) state. Arrest of normal uninfected neurons upregulated a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts and known neuronal differentiation transcripts (e.g., Neuregulin-1, GDF6 and Prnp). As expected, many activated IFN innate immune genes were simultaneously upregulated (e.g., OAS1, ISG20, CD80, cytokines, chemokines and complement) along with clusterin (CLU) that binds misfolded proteins. Arrest of latently infected CJ− cells induced even more profound global transcript differences. CJ+ cells markedly downregulated the anti-proliferative controls seen in arrested normal cells. CJ+ infection also suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ infection. In contrast, IFN and cytokine/chemokine pathways were strongly upregulated. Analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection enhances and expands anti-viral responses; 3) non-productive latent infection can epigenetically imprint many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. This rare cell model of latent infection is fundamental for interrogating triggers of late onset disease that are also relevant for Alzheimer’s Disease. Peripheral human blood and intestinal myeloid cells that are latently infected may also be conditionally stimulated in vitro to produce CJ+ linked diagnostic transcripts.">

        <tr id="Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are closely related flaviviruses which are transmitted by the same species of mosquitoes. Due to overlapping geographic distributions and transmission vectors, cases of DENV-ZIKV coinfection have been reported. However, the impact of coinfection on disease outcomes remains unclear. In this study, an in vitro model of DENV-ZIKV coinfection was developed using the primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). The interaction between DENV-2 and ZIKV during sequential coinfection revealed that prior DENV-2 infection significantly suppressed ZIKV RNA accumulation in the culture supernatant. Transcriptomic profile in response to DENV-2 infection suggested three hypothetical pathways that potentially interfere with ZIKV replication. The first mechanism is prior DENV infection drove HDFs into an antiviral state through upregulation of genes involving innate immune response pathways, including PRR signaling, type I and type II IFN signaling, ISG activity, and cytokine/chemokine activity. This state significantly enhanced resistance to subsequent ZIKV infection in both infected cells and uninfected neighboring cells. The second potential pathway is inhibition of viral entry. This was supported by DENV-2-infected HDFs significantly suppressed expression of ZIKV receptor and reduced expression of genes involving in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This can interfere with entry of ZIKV into host cells. The last possible mechanism is driving cells into cell cycle arrest, as DENV-2 infection downregulated genes related to cell cycle progression, which may hinder ZIKV replication. These findings partly unfold the interplay between DENV and ZIKV at the entry site which may explain the disease outcome of DENV-ZIKV coinfection.

        <tr id="CD16 is an activating Fc receptor on natural killer cells that mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a key mechanism in antiviral immunity. However, the role of NK cell-mediated ADCC in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, particularly whether it limits viral spread and disease severity or contributes to the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. We hypothesized that the high-affinity CD16AV176 polymorphism influences these outcomes. Using a novel in vitro reporter system, we demonstrated that CD16AV176 is a more potent and sensitive activator than the common CD16AF176 allele. To assess its clinical relevance, we analyzed 1,027 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC), a comprehensive longitudinal dataset with extensive transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data. The high-affinity CD16AV176 allele was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and severe disease trajectories. Lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers were correlated to CD16AV176; however, there was no difference in viral load across CD16 genotypes. Proteomic analysis revealed that participants homozygous for CD16AV176 had lower levels of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that CD16AV176 enhances early NK cell-mediated immune responses, limiting severe respiratory complications in COVID-19. This study identifies a protective genetic factor against severe COVID-19, informing future host-directed therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common non-infectious inflammatory CNS disease, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and focal demyelinated lesions. Traditionally considered an autoimmune disease, MS is driven by the immune system's attack on CNS myelin, resulting in cumulative disability. However, conventional anti-inflammatory treatments often fail to prevent progressive deterioration, particularly in the absence of overt inflammation, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis. Recent research has revealed a more complex disease mechanism involving both peripheral immune responses and intrinsic CNS factors, with glial cells playing a central role. Persistent inflammation in MS is associated with mixed active/inactive lesions dominated by microglia and astrocyte dysregulation. These glial populations exhibit maladaptive activation, contributing to failed remyelination and ongoing neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations as well as aging further exacerbate glial dysfunction, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation and damage. Emerging evidence suggests that the interplay between peripheral immune cells and glial populations and the potential dual-use nature of molecular tools shared by the immune system and CNS disrupts homeostatic signaling, leading to a loss of tissue integrity. This review synthesizes findings on glial cell biology in MS, with a focus on microglia and astrocytes, while addressing their roles in demyelination, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. The limitations of animal models, particularly EAE, in replicating the complexity of MS are also addressed. Finally, critical questions are outlined to guide future research into glial pathology and to identify novel therapeutic approaches targeting progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 presents with a distinct immunological profile, characterized by elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts, seen commonly in fungal and bacterial infections. This study demonstrates that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 show evidence of neutrophil degranulation and have increased expression of neutrophil surface lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), a marker of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). Both early LOX-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on neutrophils were associated with development of severe disease. To determine whether tissue damage or inflammation is required to induce PMN-MDSCs or whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly activates neutrophils to become PMN-MDSCs, we incubated healthy human neutrophils with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly induced LOX-1 surface expression in healthy neutrophils independent of productive infection. LOX-1 induction was dependent on granule exocytosis and promoted up-regulation of reactive oxygen species, CD63, and PD-L1, enabling LOX-1+ neutrophils to suppress autologous T cell proliferation in vitro. These results support a role for PMN-MDSCs in mediating severe COVID-19, and inhibition of PD-L1 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY The mechanisms by which viruses enter host cells are crucial for their ability to infect and cause disease, serving as major targets for both host immune responses and therapeutic strategies. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry process is primarily driven by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, in conjunction with the activity of endosomal cathepsin L and the serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, recent scientific advances have expanded our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, uncovering alternative receptors and novel cofactors that may enhance viral tropism and adaptability. Given the critical role of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in mediating host cell entry, it has become a primary target for prevention and therapeutic strategies. However, the continuous spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of S protein variants that may potentially confer a fitness advantage or modify key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology, such as transmissibility, infectivity, antigenicity, and/or pathogenicity, posing significant challenges to the efficacy of current interventions.

        <tr id="Bacterial meningitis (BM) requires rapid intervention, especially in immunocompromised populations. Understanding early immune responses is crucial, as they precede clinical symptoms; however, comprehensive studies remain limited. This research investigates immune-related genes to improve BM diagnosis and treatment. Mendelian randomization, differential gene expression analysis, and co-expression network analysis identified key genes associated with BM. Immune cell ratio calculations and infiltration analyses demonstrated altered immune cell proportions. Spearman correlation analysis revealed relationships between gene expression and immune cell types. Single-cell RNA sequencing, gene set enrichment analysis, and pseudotime analysis explored changes in gene expression and cell proportions across disease stages, focusing on the roles of key genes in specific immune cells. Ring Finger Protein 144B (RNF144B) was identified as a risk gene predominantly expressed in monocytes and neutrophils. Conversely, FYN Proto-Oncogene (FYN) was identified as a protective gene primarily associated with NKT cells. During BM onset, increased RNF144B expression positively correlated with elevated neutrophil levels, while reduced FYN expression correlated with decreased NKT cell levels. During remission and recovery, RNF144B expression and neutrophil proportions decreased, whereas FYN expression and NKT cell proportions increased. NKT cells appeared to play a protective role, with FYN potentially modulating T-cell receptor function in these cells, thereby reducing BM risk. RNF144B and FYN expression exhibit opposing trends in peripheral blood across BM stages, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring. These findings provide a valuable reference for early intervention strategies and personalized treatment approaches tailored to specific disease stages in the clinic.

        <tr id="Background During COVID-19 pandemic, men had reduced serum testosterone and higher mortality rate than women. Variations in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were detected in severe COVID-19 individuals. We evaluated the response of testicular macrophages, steroidogenic activity and lipid metabolism of Leydig cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Methods Testes were analyzed under light and electron microscope. Immunolocalization of human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) and viral proteins (spike and nucleocapsid) were evaluated in association with the expression of viral recognition receptor, Rigi. Steroidogenesis was evaluated by the expression of steroidogenic factor-1 (Sf1), and the immunolocalization of steroidogenic proteins and testosterone. Pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines, macrophages (CD68 and CD163) and macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected by immunolocalization and Western blot. The expression of lipid metabolism genes (Srebp, Dgat1 and Scarb1) were investigated by RT-qPCR. Results In the infected animals, the Leydig cells showed enhanced immunolocalization of hACE2, spike and nucleocapsid. The expression of Rigi, pro-inflammatory cytokines and number of macrophages increased, confirming viral infection. Sf1 expression, steroidogenic proteins and testosterone were reduced whereas the expression of Dgat1, Srebp and Scarb1 increased. Lipid droplets-enriched Leydig cells and viral particles in lipids were observed. The infected Leydig cells also showed enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines immunolabeling. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 infects Leydig cells, activates its immune response and impairs steroidogenesis. The virus uses the steroidogenic machinery and induces lipid metabolism pathways for its survival and replication in these cells. These findings support the low testosterone and HDL levels in men with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic with far-reaching impacts on human activities. Moreover, direct viral damage and uncontrolled inflammation have been proposed as contributing factors to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is also well recognized for its capability to trigger and modulate the host’s innate immune system by attaching to bacterial substances. Nevertheless, the pandemic has further emphasized the critical role of an effective host immune response in controlling viral infection and highlighted the detrimental effect of immune dysregulation. This study aimed to assess plasma levels of LBP and inflammatory biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2 patients with different malnutrition status and severity levels. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh from December 2020 to December 2021. A total of 166 SARS-CoV-2 patients were recruited including 80 critical and 86 non-critical patients. Medical history, anthropometrical parameters, disease outcome information, and relevant biochemical parameters were extracted from medical records. Plasma samples were collected to test for LBP and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, nutritional risk was assessed by the Nutrition Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002) tool. Results: This cross-sectional study found no significant differences in LBP levels between critical and non-critical SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, LBP levels significantly correlated with IL-10, TNF-α and IL-6/IL-10 levels (Spearman’s rho = 0.430, 0.276 and −0.397 respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study confirmed the elevated inflammatory cytokines in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and their association with disease severity and malnutrition. These findings may support the mechanism of gut inflammation in order to develop new interventions that lower inflammatory biomarkers, disease severity, and aid in SARS-CoV-2 prevention and management.">

Investigating the altered pathogenicity of coexisting microorganisms and their influence on disease progression provides valuable insights for the development of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against infectious processes. This article provides a comprehensive review of current literature on viral-bacterial interactions in the context of respiratory infections, their pathogenic mechanisms, and significance during the COVID-19 pandemic. It synthesizes recent findings on how SARS-CoV-2 influences mucosal immunity, facilitates secondary bacterial infections through immune modulation, and impacts disease severity and clinical outcomes in co-infected individuals. Special attention is given to the molecular and cellular pathways mediating virus-bacteria interactions, including host receptor modulation, cytokine and interferon response alterations, and disruptions to the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiota. The epidemiological trends observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including shifts in the prevalence of common respiratory pathogens and the emergence of new co-infection patterns, are also considered. Understanding the dynamic interplay between viral and bacterial pathogens is crucial for optimizing patient management, improving outcomes, and guiding effective public health interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction SARS-CoV-2’s continued global health impact underscores the importance of ongoing pathogenesis research. Insights into the host’s first line of defense against severe COVID-19 identify actionable biomarkers, informing disease management or therapeutics. Yet, the innate immune response, including cytokines, chemokines, adenosine deaminases (ADAs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), relevant to COVID-19 remain incompletely characterized. Methods Peripheral blood was longitudinally collected between May 2020 and March 2021 from COVID-19 hospitalized adults (N = 79) and healthy controls (HCs) (N = 14; not tested, assumed COVID-negative, no viral exposure or symptoms). Heparinized blood was fractionated for plasma cryopreservation and in vitro whole blood TLR-stimulation employing TLR-3, -4, and -7/8 agonists. Post-stimulation culture supernatants were analyzed using multiplex and enzymatic assays. Results Upon hospitalization, plasma concentrations of IFNγ, IL-6, CXCL10, and ADAs were significantly upregulated compared to convalescent time points and HCs. Participants with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs concentrations upon admission. Plasma cytokines, chemokines, and ADAs were positively correlated and associated with distinct temporal patterns. TLR-stimulated cell cultures from patients produced reduced IFNα2, IFNγ, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70 compared to HCs or later time points. Conclusion Higher plasma concentrations of IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs at admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Reduced TLR-mediated IFNα2, IFNγ, and IL-12p70 production suggests COVID dampens Th1-polarizing innate immune responses, providing insight into immunological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction 1-5% of all patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), even those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, continue to have symptoms after initial recovery. Symptoms associated with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PACS) include, among others, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and cognitive dysfunction. Since the dysregulated immune response appears to be caused by the sustained activation of certain immune cells, including monocytes, and the release of specific cytokines, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PACS disease on monocyte subpopulations. Methods Twenty-two healthy and thirty-two patients with PACS were included into this study. We performed blood gas analysis and measured hematological parameters from peripheral blood of PACS patients and compared them with healthy donors. Surface markers to identify monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results PACS patients had higher numbers of intermediate and CD56+ monocytes, whereas the numbers of total monocytes, classical and non-classical monocytes were normal compared to healthy donors. Comparison of patients with and without fatigue, cough, and dyspnea showed no difference in monocyte subset frequencies. However, patients with cognitive dysfunction had increased numbers of non-classical monocytes compared to patients without this symptom. Discussion This suggests a disturbed homeostasis of the monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with PACS.">

        <tr id="Objective Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by infection, characterized by high clinical heterogeneity and complex immunopathological mechanisms. Immune dysregulation plays a central role in its progression. This study aims to investigate the compositional changes of immune cells, characteristics of intercellular communication, and potential regulatory mechanisms of N⁶-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in sepsis, with a particular focus on the functional remodeling of platelets. Methods This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE167363 dataset) from sepsis patients with m6A methylation sequencing data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Through systematic analysis, we compared the differences in immune cell composition, developmental trajectories, intercellular communication, and m6A modifications among healthy controls, survivors, and non-survivors, and further screened for key m6A-regulated target genes. Results The analysis revealed that platelets gradually accumulated during the progression of sepsis, while B cells, T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exhibited a trend toward platelet-like phenotypic remodeling. Cell–cell communication analysis showed a marked decline in communication strength among immune cells as the disease worsened, particularly a significant weakening of the APP–CD74 signaling pathway between platelets and B cells, indicating impaired immune network synergy. m⁶A methylation sequencing revealed distinct remodeling of m⁶A peaks and dysregulation of related regulatory factors in non-survivors. Further integrative analysis identified RPA1 as a key m⁶A-regulated target gene, whose expression was closely associated with APP and co-regulated by multiple m6A-modifying factors. Conclusion This study reveals disruptions in immune cell interactions and an m6A-dependent mechanism of platelet functional remodeling during sepsis progression. The identification of the key target gene RPA1 offers new insights into the immunopathological mechanisms of sepsis and lays a theoretical foundation for future precision interventions and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves dysregulation of innate immune cells including monocytes, especially in progressive MS. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are essential for fatty acid transport and metabolism in multiple cell types. FABP7, a brain-FABP, maintains metabolic function in astrocytes and neural stem cells, but the effect of FABP7 on monocytes is unknown. Here we find elevated levels of FABP7 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with secondary progressive MS. Elevated serum FABP7 levels positively correlate with higher disability scores, brain lesion volumes, and lower brain volumes. FABP7 levels are increased in astrocytes from MS postmortem brain lesion. Mechanistically, in vitro treatment of FABP7 induces CD16, CD80 and IL-1β expression in monocytes via increased glycolysis. FABP7-induced gene expression reflects enhanced inflammation, chemotaxis and glucose metabolism in monocytes. In conclusion, we find that FABP7 induces pro-inflammatory profiles in monocytes, correlates with disability and represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Cognitive dysfunction represents one of the most persistent and disabling features of Long COVID, yet its molecular underpinnings remain incompletely understood. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term neurocognitive sequelae. Key processes include persistent neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial dysfunction, immune dysregulation, and neuroendocrine imbalance. Microglial activation and cytokine release (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) promote synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury, while activation of inflammasomes such as NLRP3 amplifies CNS inflammation. Vascular abnormalities, including microthrombosis and BBB leakage, facilitate the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and neurotoxic mediators. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction and reduced vagal tone further exacerbate systemic inflammation and autonomic imbalance. Biomarkers such as GFAP, NFL, IL-6, and S100B have been associated with both neuroinflammation and cognitive symptoms. Notably, transcriptomic signatures in Long COVID overlap with those observed in Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting shared pathways involving tau dysregulation, oxidative stress, and glial reactivity. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for identifying at-risk individuals and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. This review underscores the need for longitudinal research and integrative biomarker analysis to elucidate the molecular trajectory of cognitive impairment in Long COVID.">

        <tr id="Background Pathological inflammation with a loss of synaptic integrity and function has been implicated in HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Although therapeutics exist to increase the lifespan of people living with HIV (PLWH), they are not effective at preventing neuroinflammation and HIV induced neuronal damage persists. In this study, we investigate the ephrin-B/EphB axis, which regulates inflammation, in post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and experimental models in order to assess its potential role in HIV induced neuroinflammation. Methods We analyze mRNA samples of post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and uninfected controls obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) and, for comparison, of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Follow-up experiments employ mouse brain tissue and in vitro models, including immortalized human microglia, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mixed neuroglial cell cultures, cellular and molecular interference, functional and multiplex assays, immunofluorescence and mRNA sequencing to examine the role of the ephrin-B/EphB axis in neuroinflammation and the associated neurotoxicity. Results Using qRT-PCR we find increased expression of EphB2 in post-mortem brain of PLWH, and detect a correlation with pro-viral DNA, viral RNA and an inverse correlation with abstract executive function and verbal fluency. Increased expression of ephrin-B/EphB at mRNA and protein level is also observed in brains of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV suggesting the upregulation can be driven, at least in part, by expression of viral gp120 envelope protein and a type I interferon, IFNβ. Additionally, we find induction of ephrin-B1 expression in microglia following activation by IFNβ. Given the previously reported impact of EphB2 on inflammation in the periphery, the functional role of EphB2-mediated ephrin-B reverse signaling on microglia is assessed for a pro-inflammatory and anti-viral signature. We find that EphB2 treated microglia secrete inflammatory and anti-viral factors but also exert contact-independent neurotoxicity. Finally, knockdown of microglial ephrin-B1, an EphB2 binding partner, shows a partial alleviation of the microglial pro-inflammatory signature and neurotoxicity. Conclusion Our study suggests that elevated EphB2, and its reverse signaling through ephrin-B1 in microglia contribute to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in neuroHIV.

        <tr id="Background Monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in phagocytic reactions, which potentially play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Imbalance of these cells in peripheral blood has proven to affect not only innate but also adaptive immunity. It is possible that a search for strategies to restore monocyte activity could be a major step in achieving immune control over COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes and neutrophils, and COVID-19 severity, to assess the effects of a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent on phagocytosis parameters in in-hospital COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods The study included 105 adult patients with moderate COVID-19, who had been hospitalized in 2020–2021 and treated in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. All patients were divided into two groups: in Group 1 patients received standard treatment and Immunovac VP4 therapeutic vaccine, a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent as add-on therapy from Day 1 of hospitalization; in Group 2 patients did not receive any add-on treatment. The study parameters included C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), SpO2, lung involvement on chest computer tomography (CT) scan, and phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood leukocytes based on the absorption activity (AA) of monocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes against S. аureus). The parameters were assessed at 1, 14 and 30 days. Results Based on a cluster analysis of the clinical findings and the results of diagnostic tests obtained on admission, the patients were divided into 2 clusters: cluster 1 including patients with a more severe disease (n = 34) and cluster 2 including patients with a less severe disease (n = 71). Cluster 1 patients had higher levels of CRP (20.1 vs. 2.2 mg/mL, p < 0.001), AST (32.9 vs. 26.2 U/L, p = 0.003), lower SpO2 (94% vs. 96%, p < 0,001) and more extensive lung involvement on chest CT scan (35% vs. 12%, p < 0,001). There was a statistically significant direct correlation between blood monocyte AA and SpO2 (p = 0.04), an inverse correlation between monocyte AA and CRP (p = 0.003) and the extent of lung involvement on CT scan (p = 0.05). In less severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 2), no statistically significant correlation was observed. In more severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 1), there was a rise in monocyte AA on day 30 of hospitalization both in the control group (from 86.6 to 92.2, p = 0.03) and the main group, who received Immunovac VP4 add-on therapy (from 87.3 to 98.3, p = 0.05). However, the patients who received the immunostimulating agent, had higher monocyte PI than the controls, without the immunostimulant (p = 0.05). Patients from cluster 1 who were given Immunovac VP4 had higher SpO2 levels (98% vs. 97%, p = 0.01) than those who had received only the standard treatment. Discussion Blood monocyte AA correlates with COVID-19 severity: patients with less severe disease have higher AA and those with more severe illness have lower AA. The standard treatment, combined with Immunovac VP4 enhances phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes, which is associated with a more marked increase in SpO2, especially in more severe patients.">

        <tr id="During the early stages of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, concerns arose regarding the susceptibility of asthmatic children, one of the most common chronic conditions in childhood and a major cause of hospitalization in pediatric settings. Unexpectedly, evidences showed milder clinical courses and fewer asthma exacerbations in these patients, even if cases of critical and fatal infection, often related to specific clinical features of the patient, are not negligible. In this regard, obesity is considered not only an important comorbidity in patients with difficult-to-treat asthma but also a risk factor for more severe forms of COVID-19. These observations are of even greater concern in the context of an increase in childhood obesity that began even before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and has continued also as a consequence of it. Given asthma’s heterogeneity, especially in children, an endotype-based approach is crucial. This is possible through a detailed analysis of the complex metabolic pathways that correlate asthma, COVID-19 infection and obesity thanks to new high-through-put technologies, especially metabolomics, which with minimally invasive sampling, including on exhaled breath condensate (EBC), can provide precise and unbiased evidence in support of existing endotypes, making it possible to identify not only the most vulnerable individuals and thus risk stratification through specific biomarkers, but also new molecular and therapeutic targets. This review explores asthma endotypes by highlighting their shared immunometabolic pathways with COVID-19. Findings suggest that metabolomics could enable more accurate risk stratification and guide personalized interventions during viral pandemics, especially in the presence of relevant comorbidities such as obesity.">

        <tr id="Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is characterized by complex interactions within its tumor microenvironment. Understanding the immune landscape and gene expression patterns is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Methods We employed multiple analytical approaches including Mendelian randomization analysis, single-cell sequencing, gene expression profiling, and spatiotemporal analysis. The study investigated associations between NPC and comorbidities, characterized immune cell populations, and analyzed gene expression patterns. Cytokine profiles and their effects on disease risk were also examined. Results The analysis revealed potential associations between NPC and both allergic rhinitis and high myopia. Single-cell sequencing identified distinct cellular populations, including three unique B cell subpopulations (M1, M2, M3) with specific molecular signatures and spatial distributions. Temporal analysis showed dynamic changes in immune cell composition: endothelial and epithelial cells dominated the early phase, B cells peaked in the middle phase, and dendritic and T cells increased in the late phase. Gene expression clustered into four main patterns, with significant roles for immune-related genes, particularly the TNFRSF family and HLA-related genes. Cytokine analysis identified IL-6 as a significant risk factor (31.4% increased risk) while IL-10 showed protective effects (8% risk reduction). Conclusions This comprehensive analysis provides detailed insights into the complex immune microenvironment and molecular mechanisms of NPC. The identification of distinct cellular populations, temporal patterns, and key molecular players offers valuable information for understanding disease progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.">

Early detection is challenging due to heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Understanding cellular and molecular changes from preclinical (pre-SLE) to clinical stages is essential for early intervention. Polygenic risk score (PRS) has been widely used to identify subjects at risk. However, the immune dysregulation of subjects with high SLE-PRS has never been demonstrated. This study aims to delineate the cellular transcriptomic landscapes of healthy controls, pre-SLE, and SLE patients using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular signatures associated with disease progression.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 10 healthy controls, 23 pre-SLE patients with top 5% SLE-PRS without previous diagnosis of SLE, and 12 SLE patients. scRNA-seq was performed using the BD Rhapsody. Data was processed and analyzed with Seurat and other bioinformatics tools to identify differentially expressed genes and pathway enrichments across cell types and patient groups.The analysis revealed distinct transcriptional profiles among the 3 groups. PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were clustered and annotated into 5 major cell types: B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, and NK cells, as shown by UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). Additionally, the cells were further categorized into myeloid and lymphoid lineages. The myeloid-to-lymphoid (M/L) ratio progressively increased in the healthy controls to pre-SLE and SLE patients, indicating an elevated myeloid cell presence as the disease progresses (Figure 1). To identify key immune cell types within the lymphoid subsets, further clustering and analysis of immune cell were performed to resolve immune subpopulations (Figure 2). Differential gene expression between pre-SLE patients and healthy controls was visualized using volcano plots across key immune cell populations (Figure 3). Notably, pre-SLE patients exhibited significant upregulation of genes associated with early immune activation and dysregulation, such as IFI44L and IGKC, suggesting that these genes may act as potential molecular drivers in the pathogenesis of SLE.Figure 1.UMAP clustering of immune cells from healthy controls, pre-SLE, and SLE patients with distinct color-coded cell types. The accompanying table and scatter plot demonstrate an elevated myeloid-to-lymphoid ratio in pre-SLE and SLE, highlighting immune composition shifts.Figure 2.UMAP with subcluster analysis of immune cell types, displaying specific populations such as memory B cells and T cell subsets.Figure 3.Volcano plots show differentially expressed genes in various immune cell populations between pre-SLE and healthy controls.Our findings demonstrate progressive immune dysregulation at the single-cell level from pre-SLE to SLE patients. The identified molecular signatures, altered cell subsets, and immune composition shifts provide insights into SLE pathogenesis and suggest potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="The mechanism by which chronic systemic inflammation contributes to cerebral endothelial dysfunction and neurological disorders is unclear, although endothelial inflammatory signalling is considered a cornerstone of this process. Here, we have performed transcriptomic analysis of published RNASeq datasets and identified consistent upregulation of the Tumour Necrosis Factor—C‐X‐C Motif Chemokine Ligand 10 (TNF‐CXCL10) signalling pathway in mouse cerebral endothelial cells following a single inflammatory challenge. We subsequently investigated the effects of repeated low‐level inflammation on the modulation of this pathway in a mouse cerebral endothelial cell line, analysing the effect on markers of endothelial cell activation and changes in cellular function, as a potential mechanism underlying the cerebrovascular response to low‐level systemic inflammation. Mouse cerebral endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were exposed to hour‐long treatments with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), a single low concentration of TNF (0.5 ng/mL), repeated low‐concentration TNF (0.5 ng/mL, 1 h × 4 days) or a single cumulative concentration of TNF (2.0 ng/mL). RNA and protein were extracted 4 and 24 h after the final treatment for analysis of gene/protein expression using qRT‐PCR and western blotting. Repeated inflammatory challenge significantly upregulated both Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1) and CXCL10 at the mRNA and protein levels. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and phosphorylated‐STAT1 (pSTAT1) protein levels were also increased at 4 and 24 h. Differentially, tumor necrosis factor receptor‐associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and Interferon gamma (IFNγ) gene expression were decreased at 4 h, returning to control levels at 24 h. Functional analysis revealed significant increases in endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis in the presence of repeated TNF exposure. CXCL10 knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced mean caspase 3/7 activity induced by the repeated inflammatory paradigm. These data suggest an upregulation of the TNF‐CXCL10 pathway in response to low‐level repetitive inflammation in mouse cerebral endothelial cells. Modulation of this pathway may represent a broad therapeutic target for neurovascular disease.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder of abnormal B-lymphocytes. Due to immune deregulation and therapy-related factors, CLL individuals face increased infection risks, making vaccination a priority. Although COVID-19 is no longer a global emergency, understanding vaccine responses in this vulnerable population, especially those undergoing active cancer treatments, remains critical for broader infectious disease prevention strategies. We have characterized the humoral and cellular immune response of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination elicited by CLL individuals under standard-of-care treatment and watch and wait (W&W) strategy compared with healthy subjects who received a three-dose regimen six months ago. Seroconversion rates varied between 81.8% and 71.4% in individuals under W&W and dropped to 28.6%-22.2% in those under treatment, with antibody titres and neutralizing activity following the same pattern, highlighting the impact of active therapies on vaccine immunogenicity. Analysis of B-cell dynamics revealed that individuals under W&W maintained the highest levels of total B cells (CD19+) throughout the study (up to 3.5-fold higher than healthy donors, p<0.0001). Basal naïve B cells were markedly reduced across CLL groups (up to 4.3-fold lower in treated vs. W&W, p<0.0001), while memory subsets expanded over time, particularly in the W&W cohort after booster vaccination. Additionally, we found that the actively treated CLL group exhibited higher levels of cytotoxic cells (including CD8+ T cells and NK cells) when compared to the W&W or the healthy population groups. However, none of these cell populations demonstrated an increased activation capacity. Moreover, the direct cytotoxic capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CLL persons was also more efficient in the W&W group. Through our comprehensive characterization of both humoral and cellular immune responses in CLL individuals, this study provides insight into the complex immunological landscape following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Our detailed analysis supports the current vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2 for CLL patients, confirming its effectiveness and underscoring the importance of close monitoring and representing a significant advancement in our understanding of immune responses in hematological malignancies.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: COVID-19 has been associated with a wide range of immune responses, including the production of autoantibodies, particularly in severe cases. This study investigates the IgG autoantibody responses in patients with varying severities of COVID-19 infection and compares these responses with vaccinated individuals. Methods: We utilized proteomic profiling to analyze autoantibody reactivity against a broad spectrum of proteins expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets in serum samples from severe and moderate COVID-19 patients, as well as vaccinated individuals who received the inactivated CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccine. Results: Our findings indicate a marked increase in the diversity and number of IgG autoantibodies targeting intracellular and membrane-associated proteins in severe COVID-19 cases, compared to those with moderate cases of the disease. The autoantibody response in severe cases was found to primarily target proteins involved in immune cell activation, signaling, and differentiation, suggesting potential pathways of immune dysregulation and autoimmunity. In contrast, vaccinated individuals did not exhibit similar autoantibody reactivity, pointing to a more controlled immune response post-vaccination. Notably, no significant autoimmune responses were detected in the vaccinated cohort, suggesting that the inactivated vaccine does not induce autoreactive IgG. These findings align with the established safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines, especially in comparison to the heightened immune dysregulation observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The absence of a significant autoantibody response in vaccinated individuals supports the notion that vaccines, while inducing robust immune activation, do not typically trigger autoimmunity in healthy individuals. Conclusions: Our study underscores the importance of distinguishing between the immune responses triggered by infection and vaccination and highlights the need for the continued monitoring of autoimmune responses in severe COVID-19 cases. Future research should focus on the long-term persistence and clinical relevance of these autoantibodies, particularly in individuals with pre-existing autoimmune conditions or genetic predispositions.">

        <tr id="The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has plunged the world into a major crisis of overwhelming morbidity and mortality and emerged various mutant strains. Patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 develop post-acute COVID syndrome, commonly known as long COVID (LC), lasting up to 12 weeks or even longer. The mechanism has yet to be clarified. COVID-19 pseudovirus is a suitable model to understand the infection of the COVID-19 virus to cells, which is suitable to see the acute change in cells owing to its one-time infection and inactivation. The ACE2-293T cell infected by COVID-19 pseudovirus was used in this study. After the infection and removal of the pseudovirus, high amounts of ferrous ions were accumulated in mitochondria and then released into the cytosol. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was formed and caused mitochondrial dysfunction. To evaluate the effect of nutritional strategy on ferrous ion accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, lactoferrin, Q10 and Echinacea purpurea extract (EPE) were used in this study. Results showed that lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE could improve mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing the accumulation of ferrous ions and ROS in the mitochondria. HPLC analysis showed that EPE contained rich caffeic acid, and it also showed perfect improvement in mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, cells infected with pseudovirus could increase the accumulation of ferrous ions and ROS in mitochondria and be released into the cytosol after removing pseudovirus, thereby causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE were an effective nutritional strategy to suppress ferrous ion accumulation, ROS formation and advanced mitochondrial dysfunction.">

Using SARS-CoV-derived ssRNA sequences, we modeled age-dependent immune responses in mice. Aged mice exhibited higher mortality and severe lung inflammation upon viral ssRNA challenge, mirroring clinical observations. We uncovered a pre-existing inflammatory state in aged mice, characterized by elevated baseline levels of specific immune cells and cytokines correlating with poor outcomes. Age-related immune dysfunction stemmed from impaired IRF7 signaling and defective SNARE-mediated cytokine secretion in CD11b+ cells. Notably, the adoptive transfer of young CD11b+ cells to aged mice exposed to SARS-CoV2 ssRNA reduced mortality, alleviated lung inflammation, and normalized cytokine profiles. These findings provide insights into age-related immune dysregulation during viral challenges and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for severe COVID-19 in the elderly.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic infection that affects the central nervous system. However, its high infectivity makes comprehensive research with the active virus challenging. Here, we use virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type mice and in mice that express the human tau protein. VLP exposure elicits changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings in primary somatosensory and motor cortices reveal substantial short-term increases in cortical activity in VLP-injected mice, with increased stimulus-evoked activity in both genotypes and elevated spontaneous activity in the human tau genotype only. Vehicle-injected human tau mice also show increases in cortical activity patterns. Over the following weeks, activity metrics partially subside but do not completely return to baseline levels. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. Middle-aged human tau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background and overexpression of the tau protein, exhibit more severe pathobiology and may be at risk for more adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death, which is characterized by iron overload and accumulation of lipid peroxidation. As a newly identified type of cell death, its involvement in poxvirus infection and pathogenesis remains unclear. Since MPXV shares biological and pathogenic similarities with other poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus (VACV), we used VACV-infected cell and mouse models to demonstrate that VACV infection induces ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of ferroptosis significantly reduce virus replication and alleviates the inflammatory response. Additionally, we observed that VACV infection upregulates prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which contributes to virus-triggered ferroptosis and inflammation. This study identifies a novel form of cell death triggered by poxvirus infection, shedding light on host–pathogen interactions and offering a potential therapeutic target for MPXV and other Orthopoxviruses.">

        <tr id="Post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), i.e., long-lasting pathologies subsequent to infections that do not properly resolve, have both a common core and a broad diversity of manifestations. PAIS include a group of core symptoms (pathological fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disorders and pain) accompanied by a large set of diverse symptoms. Core and diverse additional symptoms, which can persist for years, exhibiting periods of relapses and remissions, usually start suddenly after an apparently common infection. PAIS display highly variable clinical features depending on the nature of the initial pathogen, and to an even larger extent, on the diversity of preexisting individual terrains in which PAIS are rooted. In a first part, I discuss biological issues related to the persistence of microbial antigens, dysregulated immune responses, reactivation of latent viruses, different potential self-sustained inflammatory loops, mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic disorders in the tryptophan- kynurenin pathway (TKP) with impact on serotonin, and consequences of a dysfunctional bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain axis. The second part deals with the nervous system dependence of PAIS. I rely on the concept of interoception, the process by which the brain senses, integrates and interprets signals originating from within the body, and sends feebacks aimed at maintaining homeostasis. Interoception is central for understanding the origin of fatigue, dysautonomia, dysfunctioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and its relation with stress, inflammation or depression. I propose that all individual predispositions leading to self-sustained vicious circles constitute building blocks that can self-assemble in many possible ways, to give rise to both core and diverse features of PAIS. A useful discrimination between different PAIS subtypes should be obtained with a composite profiling including biomarkers, questionnaires and functional tests so as to take into account PAIS multidimensionality.">

        <tr id="Background Lipid metabolic reprogramming is a key feature of sepsis, with increased lipid storage contributing to disease progression. Although lipid metabolism dysregulation has been implicated in sepsis pathogenesis, how lipid biosynthesis, particularly mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), leads to dendritic cell (DC) immunoparalysis remains unclear. Methods Intracellular lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil Red O and BODIPY staining. Gene and protein expression levels were analyzed via qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. SREBF1 activity was modulated using genetic knockout and siRNA silencing. DC phenotype and CD4+ T cell proliferation were evaluated using flow cytometry and co-culture assays. Cytokine secretion was measured using ELISA. Results In a cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis model, we observed increased lipid biosynthesis and significantly elevated SREBF1 expression in spleen DCs. Increased SREBF1 expression suppressed the expression of costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80, and CD86) and MHC II, reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12), impaired CD4+ T cell activation, and promoted apoptosis. Mechanistically, SREBF1 activation enhanced lipid biosynthesis in DCs, which triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as evidenced by increased PERK phosphorylation, eIF2α activation, and subsequent ATF4/CHOP induction. SREBF1 silencing attenuated the lipid-induced ER stress and restored DC function, whereas tunicamycin treatment partially reversed these protective effects. Conclusions Our study identifies SREBF1 as a central regulator of sepsis-induced DC immunoparalysis by coupling lipid metabolic reprogramming to ER stress activation. Targeting this SREBF1-lipid-ER stress axis represents a novel strategy to reverse immunosuppression in septic patients.

The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification is critical in various pathological conditions, yet its role in the ARDS microenvironment, particularly at the single-cell level, remains poorly understood. Methods Single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing datasets were sourced from the GEO databases. Bioinformatics and experimental approaches were employed to investigate the associations between m6A regulators and hub genes in ARDS. Results WTAP, HNRNPA2B1, and HNRNPC exhibited extensive expression within the ARDS microenvironment. Consensus clustering analysis segregated patients with sepsis into distinct subgroups, with WTAP showing significant variation across these groups. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified the brown module as most associated with WTAP, revealing five hub genes. Validation experiments confirmed high expression levels of WTAP and MYC in lung tissues. Functional assays further demonstrated that WTAP enhances ARDS progression. Conclusions In conclusion, bioinformatics analysis and preliminary experimental data suggest that WTAP promotes ARDS onset and progression by regulating m6A methylation and facilitating immune cell infiltration.">

        <tr id="Introduction Long COVID is a multisystemic condition that includes neurocognitive, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular manifestations, independent of the severity or duration of the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dysfunctional Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3) ion channels are associated with the pathophysiology of long COVID due to reduced calcium (Ca2+) influx, negatively impacting cellular processes in diverse systems. Accumulating evidence suggests the potential therapeutic benefits of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) for people suffering from long COVID. Our study aimed to investigate the efficacy of LDN in restoring TRPM3 ion channel function in natural killer (NK) cells from long COVID patients. Methods NK cells were isolated from nine individuals with long COVID, nine healthy controls, and nine individuals with long COVID who were administered LDN (3–4.5 mg/day). Electrophysiological experiments were conducted to assess TRPM3 ion channel functions modulated by pregnenolone sulfate (PregS) and ononetin. Results The findings from this current research are the first to demonstrate that long COVID patients treated with LDN have restored TRPM3 ion channel function and validate previous reports of TRPM3 ion channel dysfunction in NK cells from individuals with long COVID not on treatment. There was no significant difference in TRPM3 currents between long COVID patients treated with LDN and healthy controls (HC), in either PregS-induced current amplitude (p > 0.9999) or resistance to ononetin (p > 0.9999). Discussion Overall, our findings support LDN as a potentially beneficial treatment for long COVID patients by restoring TRPM3 ion channel function and reestablishing adequate Ca2+ influx necessary for homeostatic cellular processes.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been widely recognized as a respiratory illness, yet growing evidence highlights its significant neurological and psychiatric impact. Neuropsychiatric manifestations range from mild symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, to severe conditions including delirium, stroke, and psychosis. These symptoms may occur during the acute phase or persist long after recovery, contributing to what is known as long COVID. The underlying mechanisms are multifactorial, involving direct viral invasion, immune response, and psychosocial stressors. Understanding these effects is essential for comprehensive patient care and for developing long-term strategies in neuropsychiatric evaluation and treatment. This literature review was conducted using scientific publications found in the following databases: Virtual Health Library (BVS), Public Medline (PubMed), CAPES Periodical Portal, and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), with no time restriction. The official websites of the Ministry of Health and gray literature were also consulted. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the extensive neuropsychiatric impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting individuals across all age groups and clinical profiles. Both acute and long-term manifestations—ranging from cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders to severe neurological complications—underscore the virus’s capacity to disrupt central and peripheral nervous system function, as well as mental health. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms, early identification of symptoms, and a multidisciplinary approach to treatment are essential to mitigate these outcomes. Given the ongoing burden of long COVID, continued clinical vigilance, mental health integration into routine care, and investment in longitudinal research are crucial. As we transition from pandemic to endemic phases, addressing the neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 must remain a global public health priority.">

However, the long-term metabolic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially its role in disrupting glucose homeostasis and potentially triggering or worsening DM, remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes current clinical and experimental findings to clarify the bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes. We critically examine literature reporting deterioration of glycemic control, onset of hyperglycemia in previously non-diabetic individuals, and worsening of metabolic parameters in diabetic patients after infection. Furthermore, we explore proposed mechanistic pathways, including pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and immune-mediated damage, that may underpin the development or progression of DM in the post-COVID setting. Collectively, this work underscores the urgent need for continued research and clinical vigilance in managing metabolic health in COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="The complement (C) pathway, a vital part of innate immunity, defends against pathogens and supports tissue surveillance. While local activation in the periphery enhances immune protection, dysregulation can trigger a self-amplifying cascade that spreads beyond the initial site, resulting in tissue injury. In the brain, complement proteins regulate synaptic plasticity and connectivity, raising the possibility that similar mechanisms of maladaptive propagation may disrupt neural circuits under pathological conditions. Although complement dysregulation is linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, the impact of localized upregulation in a small subset of cells on broader cortical networks remains unclear. To examine this, we overexpressed the schizophrenia (SCZ) risk gene C4 (C4-OE) in approximately 2% of prefrontal cortex neurons in mice using in utero electroporation. Bulk RNA sequencing of microdissected tissue revealed widespread transcriptional changes in a network predominantly comprising untransfected cells. C4-OE induced the upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, cytoprotection, and neurogenesis—suggesting a response consistent with compensatory remodeling or aberrant plasticity. Co-expression analysis identified a C4b-containing module enriched for dendritic development and cell cycle regulation, indicating alterations in circuit maturation. In contrast, immune and inflammatory genes were broadly downregulated, suggesting homeostatic suppression in response to sustained complement activity. Comparisons with human SCZ proteomic datasets revealed conserved gene signatures, highlighting the potential of our model to capture disease-relevant mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that sparse C4 overexpression can trigger widespread transcriptional changes across neural circuits, suggesting that local complement dysregulation may spread through cortical networks and drive broader functional disruption. Graphical Abstract Graphical Abstract: Sparse overexpression of complement C4 in prefrontal cortical neurons triggers widespread transcriptional changes across the network. Upregulated genes were associated with cholesterol biosynthesis, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and cytoprotective pathways, while immune and inflammatory genes were broadly downregulated, suggesting a compensatory response in neighboring, untransfected cells. These results indicate that localized complement dysregulation can alter transcriptional signatures across connected cortical circuits, potentially contributing to circuit-wide dysfunction initiated by focal immune activation.">

Methods: This study employed multiparametric immunophenotyping and metabolic profiling to investigate cellular immunity, cytokine dynamics, and serum biomarkers in pregnant women infected with H3N2 across gestational stages. Through integrated flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), multiple cytokine quantification, and LC-MS-based serum metabolomics, we compared immunological parameters, serum cytokines, and metabolites across trimesters in pregnant women infected and not infected with H3N2. Results: The results revealed reduced CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios, a diminished CD27+ memory B cell population in pregnant women infected with H3N2, and elevated NK cells and Th2-skewed cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) in severe influenza cases. Metabolomic profiling identified the dysregulation of the tryptophan–kynurenine (Trp–Kyn) pathway, with a 15-fold increase in the Kyn/Trp ratio in severe influenza compared to a normal pregnancy as a potential biomarker. Conclusions: These results elucidate synergistic pathophysiological axes-immune dysregulation and tryptophan metabolism alteration that potentially drive adverse outcomes.

This review elucidates the multifaceted impact of SARS-CoV-2 on diabetes mellitus, emphasizing the increased complexity of glycemic management in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection following viral infection in the postpandemic era. In this study, we examined the diverse effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on individuals with diabetes. These effects included an elevated risk of morbidity, erratic fluctuations in blood glucose levels, the emergence of complications associated with diabetes, and the emergence of challenges related to self-management of the disease. From a mechanistic perspective, we investigated the following factors: SARS-CoV-2-mediated direct damage to islet beta cells, dysregulation of the RAAS system, impairment of islet function by oxidative stress, and the effects of the integrated stress response, stress response, and reduced adiponectin levels on insulin utilization efficiency and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, viral effects extend to diabetic complications and cardiovascular risk factors, such as coagulation abnormalities, hypertension, and lipid metabolism. This results in an exacerbation of the development of diabetic complications.

        <tr id="The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes serious respiratory illness and related disorders. Vulnerable populations, including those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and the elderly, face an increased risk of severe complications. As the pandemic evolves, various diagnostic techniques are available to detect severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), including clinical presentation, rapid antigen/antibody testing, molecular testing, supplemental laboratory analysis, and imaging. Based on peer-reviewed data, treatment options include convalescent plasma transfusion, corticosteroids, antivirals, and immunomodulatory medications. Convalescent plasma therapy, historically used in outbreaks like Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and SARS, is suggested by the World Health Organization for critically ill COVID-19 patients when vaccines or antiviral drugs are unavailable. Neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma help control viral load and improve patient outcomes, especially when administered early, though effectiveness varies. The United States Food and Drug Administration has authorized its emergency use for severe COVID-19 cases, but potential risks such as transfusion reactions and transfusion-related acute lung injury require further investigation to establish definitive efficacy. Antiviral agents like Remdesivir, an adenosine nucleotide analog, inhibit viral RNA polymerase and have shown efficacy in reducing COVID-19 severity, leading to its emergency use authorization for hospitalized patients. Other antivirals like ritonavir, lopinavir, and umifenovir disrupt viral replication and entry, but their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has been used in critically ill COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation and prevent respiratory failure, as shown in the RECOVERY trial. Other immunosuppressants like ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and colchicine help modulate the immune response, reducing cytokine storms and inflammation-related complications. However, corticosteroids carry risks such as hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, and delayed viral clearance, requiring careful administration. Systematic reviews of clinical studies revealed that hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin did not decrease viral load nor reduce the severity of symptoms, but increased mortality among acutely hospitalized patients. There was no improvement in patients’ clinical conditions after 15 days compared to standard treatment. The United States Food and Drug Administration has revoked the authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients due to the null benefit-risk balance. Monoclonal antibodies like itolizumab, gimsilumab, sarilumab, and tocilizumab are being studied for their ability to reduce the severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, particularly cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These antibodies target specific immune pathways to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, with some showing promising results in clinical trials, though their use remains under investigation. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas13 family of enzymes, sequenced from many COVID-19-positive patients, can potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, cleave the RNA genome, and aid in the amplification of the genome assay. Cas13 can also target emerging pathogens via an adeno-associated virus vector when delivered to the infected lungs. In addition to pharmacological agents, vaccines effectively prevent symptomatic infection, reduce hospitalizations, minimize mortality rates, and ultimately reduce the severity of the disease. This paper aims to explore the management of patients with underlying conditions who present with COVID-19 to lessen the burden on healthcare systems.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease damaging the central nervous system. Diminished inflammatory disease activity (DA) as people with MS (pwMS) age motivated randomized clinical trials assessing disease-modifying therapy (DMT) discontinuation in older pwMS given the concern for risks outweighing benefits. This study aims to examine whether peripheral production of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)-driven cytokine responses mediate the aging-associated decline in MS inflammatory DA. Methods We included the clinical data of 669 adult pwMS between 2017 and 2022 who enrolled in a clinic-based prospective cohort. From a subset of 80 participants, we isolated fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cultured with 50 µg/ml of MBP (or heat-killed Candida) for 24 h. We assayed cell culture supernatants for interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and a subset of the supernatant samples using a commercial human cytokine/chemokine array. We examined the associations between age and annualized relapse rate (ARR) as well as between age and MBP-stimulated cytokine production (by cultured PBMC) using covariate-adjusted linear regressions. We performed mediation analyses to determine the extent to which MBP-driven cytokine response drives the association between age and ARR. Results Among 669 pwMS (mean age 51.7 ± 12.7 years, 80.7% women, 89.4% non-Hispanic White), ARR declined with age (β=-0.003, p < 0.001). Among the subgroup of 80 pwMS whose cultured PBMCs underwent ex vivo MBP stimulation, IL-17 production declined with age in women (β=-0.27, p = 0.04) but not men (β=-0.1, p = 0.73). MBP-driven IL-17 response partially mediated the association between older age and lower ARR (24.6% in women, 15.3% in men). In exploratory analyses, older pwMS (≥ 50 years) had marginally lower (IL-4, MCP-2, MCP-3, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB) and higher (Fractalkine, MDC) concentrations of several cytokines than younger pwMS (< 50 years), while certain cytokines (MCP-2, MDC) mediated whereas others negated the effect of age on ARR. Conclusion Diminished peripheral IL-17 response as a potential biological mechanism underlying the aging-dependent decline in MS inflammatory DA warrants further investigation.

        <tr id="We recently developed an original HCV-permissive cell culture model based on both partial differentiation and physiological oxygen pressure (Hypo-Diff cells) that produces highly infectious lipid-rich and native-like HCV-lipoviroparticles (LVPs). Here, we explored the precise role of physiological hypoxia and related specific transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and 2α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) to better understand the mechanism governing viral morphogenesis. Knocking-down HIF-2α specifically reduced both the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets in Huh7.5 Hypo-Diff cells, suggesting a central role for HIF-2 in controlling lipid metabolism under physiological hypoxia. In HCV-infected siHIF-2α Hypo-Diff cells, both HCV replication and the specific infectious viral efficacy of progeny viruses were significantly impaired. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of a mutated form of the HIF-2α protein, stabilized in normoxia, both increased the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets and restored the production of highly infectious HCV viruses in the absence of cell differentiation. Finally, by iodixanol fractionation of supernatants to determine the mean buoyant density of infectious HCV LVPs, we established that HIF-2α is exclusively responsible for producing highly lipidated and broadly infectious HCV-LVPs by Hypo-Diff cells. These findings thus clearly establish the central role of physiological hypoxia, and notably HIF-2, in the production of highly infectious lipid-rich native-like HCV particles. Since physiological hypoxia is a shared characteristic in mammalian tissues, we propose to reconsider the role of natural oxygen tension and especially the role of HIF-2 in the life cycle of other lipid-associated viruses, whether hepatotropic or not.

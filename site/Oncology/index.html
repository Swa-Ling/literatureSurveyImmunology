        <tr id="The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory immune response. Monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been observed in monocytes of patients with COVID-19, but the mechanism and consequences of inflammasome activation require further investigation. In this study, we inoculated a macrophage-like THP-1 cell line, primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, and primary monocytes with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages does not rely on viral replication, receptor-mediated entry, or actin-dependent entry. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hNEC cultures without triggering the production of inflammasome cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. Importantly, these cytokines did not inhibit viral replication in hNEC cultures. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of primary monocytes led to inflammasome activation and induced a macrophage phenotype in these cells. Monocytic cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not from peripheral blood, of patients with COVID-19, showed evidence of inflammasome activation, expressed the proinflammatory marker CD11b, and displayed oxidative burst. These findings highlight the central role of activated macrophages, as a result of direct viral sensing, in COVID-19 and support the inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 as potential therapeutic strategies to reduce immunopathology without increasing viral replication.


IMPORTANCE
Inflammasome activation is associated with severe COVID-19. The impact of inflammasome activation on viral replication and mechanistic details of this activation are not clarified. This study advances our understanding of the role of inflammasome activation in macrophages by identifying TLR2, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 as dependent factors in this activation. Further, it highlights that SARS-CoV-2 inflammasome activation is not a feature of nasal epithelial cells but rather activation of bystander macrophages in the airway. Finally, we demonstrate that two pro inflammatory cytokines produced by inflammasome activation, IL-18 and IL-1β, do not restrict viral replication and are potential targets to ameliorate pathological inflammation in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Emerging evidence shows increased humoral response post-omicron surge, but research on T cell responses is limited. This study investigated the durability, magnitude, and breadth of SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific T cell responses in 216 two-dose vaccinated individuals pre- and post-omicron surge. Post-surge samples showed enhanced T cell responses, indicating widespread asymptomatic exposure to omicron. Further analysis of 105 individuals with multiple exposures to SARS-CoV-2 through boosters or infections showed that post-omicron, two-dose vaccinated individuals had T cell responses comparable to those of COVID-19 convalescents or boosted individuals. Additionally, we report cross-reactive T cell responses against omicron sub-variants, including BA2.86, remained strong, with preserved frequencies of spike-specific stem-cell-like memory T cells. In silico prediction indicates that mutated epitopes of JN.1 and KP.2 retain over 95.6% of their HLA binding capability. Overall, our data suggests that T cell responses are sustained, enhanced, and cross-reactive against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants following symptomatic or asymptomatic omicron infection.">

        <tr id="The severity of COVID-19 is linked to excessive inflammation. Neutrophils represent a critical arm of the innate immune response and are major mediators of inflammation, but their role in COVID-19 pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We conducted transcriptomic profiling of neutrophils obtained from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, as well as from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, in comparison to non-infected healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the inflammasome formation potential in neutrophils from patients and mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), consisting mainly of mature neutrophils, revealed a striking type I interferon (IFN-I) gene signature in severe COVID-19 patients, contrasting with mild COVID-19 and healthy controls. Notably, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) from severe COVID-19 patients exhibited an immature neutrophil phenotype and lacked this IFN-I signature. Moreover, PMNs from severe COVID-19 patients showed heightened nigericin-induced caspase1 activation, but reduced responsiveness to exogenous inflammasome priming. Furthermore, IFN-I emerged as a priming stimulus for neutrophil inflammasomes. These findings suggest a potential role for neutrophil inflammasomes in driving inflammation during severe COVID-19.

        <tr id="Cardiovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include myocardial injury, heart failure, and myocarditis and are associated with long-term disability and mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and antigens are found in the myocardium of COVID-19 patients, and human cardiomyocytes are susceptible to infection in cell or organoid cultures. While these observations raise the possibility that cardiomyocyte infection may contribute to the cardiac sequelae of COVID-19, a causal relationship between cardiomyocyte infection and myocardial dysfunction and pathology has not been established. Here, we generated a mouse model of cardiomyocyte-restricted infection by selectively expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in cardiomyocytes. Inoculation of Myh6-Cre Rosa26loxP-STOP-loxP-hACE2 mice with an ancestral, non-mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in viral replication within the heart, accumulation of macrophages, and moderate left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Cardiac pathology in this model was transient and resolved with viral clearance. Blockade of monocyte trafficking reduced macrophage accumulation, suppressed the development of LV systolic dysfunction, and promoted viral clearance in the heart. These findings establish a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 cardiomyocyte infection that recapitulates features of cardiac dysfunctions of COVID-19 and suggests that both viral replication and resultant innate immune responses contribute to cardiac pathology.IMPORTANCEHeart involvement after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurs in multiple ways and is associated with worse outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. It remains unclear if cardiac disease is driven by primary infection of the heart or immune response to the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is capable of entering contractile cells of the heart in a culture dish. However, it remains unclear how such infection affects the function of the heart in the body. Here, we designed a mouse in which only heart muscle cells can be infected with a SARS-CoV-2 strain to study cardiac infection in isolation from other organ systems. In our model, infected mice show viral infection, worse function, and accumulation of immune cells in the heart. A subset of immune cells facilitates such worsening heart function. As this model shows features similar to those observed in patients, it may be useful for understanding the heart disease that occurs as a part of COVID-19.">

 The immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are still under investigation. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild in the pediatric population, some children develop severe clinical manifestations or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after infection. MIS-C, typically emerging 2-6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, is characterized by a hyperinflammatory response affecting multiple organs. This review aims to explore the complex landscape of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, focusing on innate, T cell-, and B cell-mediated immunity, and discusses the role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a superantigen in MIS-C pathophysiology. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving the management and outcomes for affected children.">

This infection model recapitulates breathing-like stretch and culture of epithelial cells at the air–liquid interface and resulted in clinically relevant cytopathic effects including cell rounding of alveolar type 2 cells and disruption of the tight junction protein occludin. Viral replication was confirmed by immunocytochemical nucleocapsid staining in the epithelium and increased shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus within 2 days post-infection, associated with changes in innate host immune responses. Together, these data demonstrate that, under the experimental conditions used in this work, this human alveolus MPS chip can successfully model SARS-CoV-2 infection of human alveolar lung cells.">

        <tr id="One possible determinant of COVID-19 severity is immune imprinting (IP) by Common Cold Coronavirus (CCCV). As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns. Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.">

        <tr id="Immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet the demands associated with immune responses. The effects of aging on these pathways and on the metabolic phenotype of the immune cells participating in antibody responses to vaccines are still largely unknown. Here we used a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 that utilizes the cellular heat shock chaperone glycoprotein 96 (gp96), engineered to co-express SARS-CoV-2 Spike (spike) protein (gp96-Ig-S). Results show that this vaccine induces comparable B cell primary responses in young and old mice at later time points, but a significantly lesser secondary response in old as compared to young mice, with the antibodies generated in the secondary response being also of lower avidity. This occurs because aging changes the B cell metabolic phenotype and induces hyper-metabolic B cells that are associated with higher intrinsic inflammation and decreased protective antibody responses. However, the gp96-Ig-S vaccine was found to be effective in significantly reducing the metabolic/inflammatory status of B cells from old mice, suggesting the possibility that targeting metabolic pathways may improve immune function in old mice that do not respond adequately to the vaccine.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is characterized by its high transmissibility, which has caused a worldwide epidemiological event. Yet, it turns ominous once the disease progression degenerates into severe pneumonia and sepsis, presenting a horrendous lethality. To elucidate the alveolar immune or inflammatory landscapes of Omicron critical-ill patients, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with critical pneumonia caused by Omicron infection, and analyzed the correlation between the clinical severity scores and different immune cell subpopulations. In the BALF of Omicron critical patients, the alveolar violent myeloid inflammatory environment was determined. ISG15+ neutrophils and CXCL10+ macrophages, both expressed the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), were negatively correlated with clinical pulmonary infection score, while septic CST7+ neutrophils and inflammatory VCAN+ macrophages were positively correlated with sequential organ failure assessment. The percentages of ISG15+ neutrophils were associated with more protective alveolar epithelial cells, and may reshape CD4+ T cells to the exhaustive phenotype, thus preventing immune injuries. The CXCL10+ macrophages may promote plasmablast/plasma cell survival and activation as well as the production of specific antibodies. As compared to the previous BALF scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 wild-type/Alpha critical patients, the subsets of neutrophils and macrophages with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features presented obvious distinctions, suggesting an immune disparity in Omicron variants. Overall, this study provides a BALF single-cell atlas of Omicron critical patients, and suggests that alveolar interferon-responsive neutrophils and macrophages may extricate SARS-CoV-2 Omicron critical patients from the nasty fate of sepsis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) preferentially infects the respiratory tract; however, several studies have implicated a multi-organ involvement. Hepatic dysfunctions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been increasingly recognized and described to correlate with disease severity. To elucidate molecular factors that could contribute towards hepatic infection, we concentrated on microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that modulate various cellular processes and which are reported to be differentially regulated during liver injury. We aimed to study the infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) with SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the potential of miRNAs for modulating viral infection.


METHODS
We analysed liver autopsies from a coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-positive cohort for the presence of viral RNA using Nanopore sequencing. PHH were used for the infection with SARS-CoV-2. The candidate miRNAs targeting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were identified using in silico approaches. To discover the potential regulatory mechanism, transfection experiments, qRT-PCRs, western blots and luciferase reporter assays were performed.


RESULTS
We could detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19-positive liver autopsies. We show that PHH express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and can be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulting in robust replication. Transfection of selected miRNA mimics reduced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression and SARS-CoV-2 burden in PHH. In silico and biochemical analyses supported a potential direct binding of miR-141-3p to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.


CONCLUSION
We confirm that PHH are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate selected miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and/or the viral genome reduce viral loads. These data provide novel insights into hepatic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and associated dysfunctions in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has confirmed that the ability to rapidly mutate may be extremely beneficial for a virus. Not long after the first wave, new variants emerged with altered infectivity, disease severity, and mortality. These new strains most notably had numerous mutations of the spike (S) protein, a surface protein responsible for binding to and entering the host cell. The Delta and Omicron strains demonstrated increased immune evasion and improved binding affinity to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This study examines the ability of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 IgG to bind Delta and Omicron antigens, as well as their functional binding capabilities to two different S-ACE2 complexes. Twenty SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from patients who had recovered from infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in the first wave of COVID-19 and 10 pre-pandemic control samples were studied. SARS-CoV-2 exposed patients showed significantly higher levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD (p < 0.001), N protein (p < 0.001), and Omicron spike variant (p = 0.01), but not to Delta spike variant (p = 0.966) when compared with controls. Furthermore, patient samples showed significantly greater inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 binding (p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Conversely, there was no correlation between the binding inhibition of S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 receptor. This study shows there is considerable cross-reactivity of IgG generated by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Delta and Omicron variants.">

        <tr id="Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) is a common human neurotropic virus with the majority of adults harboring latent-recurrent infections. In rare cases, HSV-1 infection can access the central nervous system through the neuronal route and develop into life-threatening encephalitis. Here, we used a mouse model for HSV-1 infection to describe the transcriptomic profile of the infected brain stem at the single-cell level and with temporal resolution. Among resident brain cells, microglia increased in proportion during the course of infection, while astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cell levels decrease. At the levels of peripheral immune cells, we found notably monocytes to strongly influx the infected brain. Large dynamic changes were found in the abundance of subpopulations of the different cell types following virus infection. For instance, we identify one subpopulation of microglia exhibiting very high type I interferon and chemokine expression early during infection. This population was also enriched for viral transcripts, suggesting localization at foci of infection, and orchestrating recruitment of other immune cells. In contrast, for the infiltrating monocytes, we identified a larger panel of unique subpopulations with antiviral and inflammatory phenotypes, and found not all of these being highly positive for viral transcripts, thus indicating monocyte activities beyond the infected brain areas. Finally, investigation of endothelial cell cross-talk with other cell types revealed that cytokines derived from microglia and monocyte, but also T cells, contribute to disturbance of the blood brain barrier. Our work thus reveals for the first time the complex nature of the cellular response in the virus-infected brain, which seeks to eliminate infection but can also prime for pathological changes.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infects via the respiratory tract, but COVID-19 includes an array of non-respiratory symptoms, among them gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as vomiting and diarrhea. Here we investigated the GI pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in rhesus macaques and humans. Macaques experienced mild infection with USA-WA1/2020 and shed viral RNA in the respiratory tract and stool, including subgenomic RNA indicative of replication in the GI tract. Intestinal immune cell populations were disturbed, with significantly fewer proliferating (Ki67+) jejunal B cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques than uninfected ones. Modest translocation of bacteria/bacterial antigen was observed across the colonic epithelium, with a corresponding significant increase in plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) that may be induced by LPS. Human plasma demonstrated significant decreases in interleukin (IL)-6 and sCD14 upon recovery from COVID-19, suggesting resolution of inflammation and response to translocated bacteria. sCD14 significantly positively correlated with zonulin, an indicator of gut barrier integrity, and IL-6. These results demonstrate that GI perturbations such as microbial translocation can occur in even mild SARS-CoV-2 infections and may contribute to the COVID-19 inflammatory state.IMPORTANCEThis study investigates gastrointestinal (GI) barrier disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infections and how it may contribute to disease. We observed bacteria or bacterial products crossing from the colon interior (the lumen) to the lamina propria during SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. Bacteria/bacterial products are tolerated in the lumen but may induce immune responses if they translocate to the lamina propria. We also observed a significant increase in soluble CD14, which is associated with an immune response to bacterial products. In addition, we observed that humans recovering from COVID-19 experienced a significant decrease in soluble CD14, as well as the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 and sCD14 correlated significantly across macaque and human samples. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in GI barrier disruption that permits microbial translocation and a corresponding immune response. These findings could aid in developing interventions to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

These immune changes in T lymphocytes are closely associated with disease progression, but the specific mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further investigation. This paper reviewed the changes in the number and function of T cells in respiratory viral infections, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2, and summarized related therapeutic explorations.

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever, is an emerging respiratory disease caused by soil dwelling fungi of the Coccidioides genus that is expected to spread from the southwest into the central U.S. by 2050. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the other 40% of patients experience a range of symptoms, from self-limiting pneumonia to life-threatening disseminated disease. The immunological events that underlie the progression to severe disease remain under defined. Here, we probed the early immune response to Coccidioides using a high dose of an attenuated strain of C. posadasii in a mouse model of infection coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing. At 24 hours post-infection, robust immune infiltration is detected in the lung, marked by high levels of inflammatory PD-L1+ neutrophils and fungal-contact dependent pro-fibrotic Spp1+ macrophages. These findings elucidate the early dynamics of the host response to Coccidioides and provide a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the lung. Importance By examining early immune dynamics in the lungs, we uncover critical insights into how myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, are recruited and differentiated during Coccidioides infection. The discovery of specific immune cell subsets, such as PD-L1+ neutrophils and Spp1+ macrophages, which are associated with inflammation and fibrosis, highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interactions that occur during Coccidioides infection, offering valuable directions for developing more effective treatments and preventive strategies against this increasingly prevalent disease.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the subsequent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised questions about its impact on pediatric asthma. This review analyzes the latest research to offer a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between COVID-19 and pediatric asthma.


AREAS COVERED
This narrative review examines the effects of COVID-19 on pediatric asthma, exploring clinical outcomes, immune responses, recommended treatments, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and COVID-19 vaccination. Data were sourced from databases (PubMed, Embase, and BioRxiv/MedRxiv) from January 2020 to November 2023.


EXPERT OPINION
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the international scientific community rapidly developed extensive knowledge, demonstrating unprecedented cooperation. Despite these advances, questions remain about SARS-CoV-2 infection and pediatric asthma. Most research consists of epidemiological studies with varying methods, sometimes yielding contradictory results. While asthma generally did not increase the risk of severe COVID-19 in children, uncontrolled asthma was a risk factor, highlighting the importance of maintaining asthma management. Telemedicine has proven effective for asthma control and will continue to grow, despite its limitations. Notably, allergic asthma may have a protective role against severe COVID-19. We recommend COVID-19 vaccination in the pediatric age group, including those with asthma.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against β-coronaviruses (β-CoVs), a family of viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2. Viral sensing via pattern recognition receptors triggers inflammation and cell death, which are essential components of the innate immune response that facilitate viral clearance. However, excessive activation of the innate immune system and inflammatory cell death can result in uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in cytokine storm and pathology. PANoptosis, innate immune, inflammatory cell death initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes, has been implicated in the pathology of viral infections. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PANoptosis in response to β-CoV infection is critical for identifying new therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease severity. In the current study, we analyzed findings from a cell death-based CRISPR screen with archetypal β-CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as the trigger to characterize host molecules required for inflammatory cell death. As a result, we identified SMARCA4, a chromatin regulator, as a putative host factor required for PANoptosis in response to MHV. Furthermore, we observed that gRNA-mediated deletion of Smarca4 inhibited MHV-induced PANoptotic cell death in macrophages. These findings have potential translational and clinical implications for the advancement of treatment strategies for β-CoVs and other infections.">

        <tr id="The unprecedented research effort associated with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) included several extensive proteomic studies that identified host proteins that interact with individual viral gene products. However, in most cases, the consequences of those virus–host interactions for virus replication were not experimentally pursued, which is a necessary step in determining whether the interactions represent pro- or anti-viral events. One putative interaction commonly identified in multiple studies was between the host adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) subunit B1 (AP3B1) and the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E). AP3B1 is one subunit of AP-3 required for the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles (LROs), and its function impacts important disease processes including inflammation and vascular health. Thus, interactions between AP3B1 and SARS-CoV-2 might influence the clinical outcomes of infection. To determine if AP3B1 has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, we first confirmed the interaction in virus-infected cells using immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). AP3B1 is required by multiple viruses to aid in the replication cycle and therefore may be a therapeutic target. However, we found that the overexpression of AP3B1 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas the siRNA-mediated depletion of AP3B1 increased the release of infectious virus, suggesting an antiviral role for AP3B1. Together, our findings suggest that AP3B1 is an intrinsic barrier to SARS-CoV-2 replication through interactions with the viral E protein. Our work justifies further investigations of LRO trafficking in SARS-CoV-2 target cells and their role in viral pathogenesis.">

Although studies have shown olfactory and hematogenous invasion into the CNS, coinciding with neuroinflammation, little attention has been paid to susceptibility of the PNS to infection or to its contribution to CNS invasion. Here we show that sensory and autonomic neurons in the PNS are susceptible to productive infection with SARS-CoV-2 and outline physiological and molecular mechanisms mediating neuroinvasion. Our infection of K18-hACE2 mice, wild-type mice, and golden Syrian hamsters, as well as primary peripheral sensory and autonomic neuronal cultures, show viral RNA, proteins, and infectious virus in PNS neurons, satellite glial cells, and functionally connected CNS tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate, in vitro, that neuropilin-1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 neuronal entry. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly invades the PNS prior to viremia, establishes a productive infection in peripheral neurons, and results in sensory symptoms often reported by COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a crucial role in regulation of immune response. It is believed that excessive activity of Treg cells in the early stages of infectious diseases reduces the pro-inflammatory activity of cells in the innate and adaptive immune response, thereby contributing to the development of chronic inflammation or excessive inflammation. Additionally, it is known that aging leads to changes in the quantity of Treg cells and disrupts their activity. It is established that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to fatal and severe cases of the disease, primarily among the elderly population. However, the underlying cause of the development of severe forms in elderly individuals remains incompletely understood. Thus, we hypothesized that the dysregulation of the Treg cell activity in elderly individuals may contribute to the development of severe forms and lethality from SARS-CoV-2, leading to the emergence of hyper inflammation in this population. 
To investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the immunosuppressive properties of Treg cells, venous blood samples were obtained from young healthy volunteers and elderly individuals. Dendritic cells were obtained by PBMC adhesion on plastic. Adherent monocytes were cultured in cytokine medium with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-SCF), with addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after 48 hours and incubated for an additional 24 hours with S1 or N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The obtained dendritic cells presenting SARS-CoV-2 antigens were then co-cultured with autologous CD4+-T lymphocytes ex vivo. The expression level of immunosuppressive membrane-associated and soluble molecules expressed by Treg cells was assessed using flow cytometry. 
Our results indicate that the immunosuppressive activity of Treg cells exhibits contrasting patterns in the two donor groups studied in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The proportion of Treg cells, as well as the expression levels of the immunosuppressive molecules, including tumor growth factor beta (TGF-b), CD39, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related (GITR) protein, and the levels of the intracellular immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-35, in Treg cells obtained from peripheral blood of elderly donors, significantly increased in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo, when compared to the group of young donors. Conversely, in the group of young donors were observed a decrease in the expression of these markers and an increase in the concentration of extracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ ex vivo, which activate the effector immune cells and contribute to virus elimination. 
In summary, the presented results suggest that Treg cells derived from elderly individuals exhibit elevated immunosuppressive activity in response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo. Obtained results may indicate that in elderly individuals on the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection Treg cells may also possess enhanced immunosuppressive activity, which may contribute to the overall suppression of anti-viral immune responses, thereby potentially leading to the delayed SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance and development of severe forms of the disease.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are critical human pathogens that continually expand to naïve populations and for which there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain. Author Summary Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes brain inflammation in both animals and humans when transmitted by mosquito bite or infectious aerosols. The mechanisms underlying disease caused by VEEV, including the role of the immune response in brain pathology, are not well understood. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the immune response to VEEV in the brain over time using two advanced sequencing techniques. Following infection, immune cells infiltrate the brain in a sequential fashion and display different activation profiles. Different types of immune cells also display strikingly different spatial patterns throughout the brain. This study provides the most comprehensive description of the immune response to VEEV in the brain performed to date and advances our understanding of immune-driven neuropathology and identification of therapeutic targets.">

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and changes to the host cellular landscape leading to neurological disease has been understudied. Through quantitative proteomic analysis of HPeV-3 infected neural organoids, we identified unique metabolic changes following HPeV-3 infection that indicate immunometabolic dysregulation. Protein and pathway analyses showed significant alterations in neurotransmission and potentially, neuronal excitotoxicity. Elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and neurofilament light (NfL) confirmed glutamate excitotoxicity to be a key mechanism contributing to neuronal toxicity in HPeV-3 infection and can lead to apoptosis induced by caspase signaling. These insights are pivotal in delineating the metabolic landscape following severe HPeV-3 CNS infection and may identify potential host targets for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to life-threatening clinical manifestations. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at higher risk for severe courses of COVID-19. So far, however, there are hardly any strategies for predicting the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CVD patients at hospital admission. Thus, we investigated whether this prediction is achievable by prospectively analysing the blood immunophenotype of 94 nonvaccinated participants, including uninfected and acutely SARS-CoV-2-infected CVD patients and healthy donors, using a 36-colour spectral flow cytometry panel. Unsupervised data analysis revealed little differences between healthy donors and CVD patients, whereas the distribution of the cell populations changed dramatically in SARS-CoV-2-infected CVD patients. The latter had more mature NK cells, activated monocyte subsets, central memory CD4+ T cells, and plasmablasts but fewer dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, innate lymphoid cells, and CD8+ T-cell subsets. Moreover, we identified an immune signature characterised by CD161+ T cells, intermediate effector CD8+ T cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells that is predictive for CVD patients with a severe course of COVID-19. Thus, intensified immunophenotype analyses can help identify patients at risk of severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, improving clinical outcomes through specific treatment.">

        <tr id="Understanding the pathophysiology of long COVID is one of the most intriguing challenges confronting contemporary medicine. Despite observations recently made in the relevant molecular, cellular, and physiological domains, it is still difficult to say whether the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 directly correspond to the consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This work hypothesizes that neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) production are at the interconnection of three positive feedback loops which are initiated in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and which involve inflammation, immunothrombosis, and autoimmunity. This phenomenon could be favored by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 may directly bind and penetrate neutrophils. The ensuing strong neutrophil stimulation leads to a progressive amplification of an exacerbated and uncontrolled NETs production, potentially persisting for months beyond the acute phase of infection. This continuous self-stimulation of neutrophils leads, in turn, to systemic inflammation, micro-thromboses, and the production of autoantibodies, whose significant consequences include the persistence of endothelial and multiorgan damage, and vascular complications.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) remain a significant global cause of mortality and disability. Viruses constitute a substantial proportion of LRTI cases, with their pandemic potential posing a latent threat. After the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the resurgence of other respiratory viruses, including Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus responsible for LRTI has been observed especially in susceptible populations.


AREAS COVERED
This review details the inflammatory mechanisms associated with three primary respiratory viruses: SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The focus will be on elucidating the activation of inflammatory pathways, understanding cellular contributions to inflammation, exploring the role of interferon and induced cell death in the response to these pathogens and detailing viral evasion mechanisms. Furthermore, the distinctive characteristics of each virus will be explained.


EXPERT OPINION
The study of viral pneumonia, notably concerning SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and RSV, offers critical insights into infectious and inflammatory mechanisms with wide-ranging implications. Addressing current limitations, such as diagnostic accuracy and understanding host-virus interactions, requires collaborative efforts and investment in technology. Future research holds promise for uncovering novel therapeutic targets, exploring host microbiome roles, and addressing long-term sequelae. Integrating advances in molecular biology and technology will shape the evolving landscape of viral pneumonia research, potentially enhancing global public health outcomes.">

Since its emergence in the early 2000s, SARS has posed significant public health challenges and continues to be a concern. This review provides an overview of current treatment strategies for SARS-CoV and explores the potential utility of herbal molecules in combating this viral infection. The primary treatment approach for SARS-CoV has historically centered on supportive care, which includes oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and antipyretic medications to manage symptoms. However, with the ongoing advancement of medical research and our evolving understanding of the virus, several antiviral drugs have been developed and repurposed to target SARS-CoV. Recent developments in the field of herbal medicine have drawn attention to the potential efficacy of natural compounds in the management of viral infections, including SARS. Herbal molecules, characterized by their diverse bioactive constituents, exhibit antiviral properties that could be harnessed to mitigate SARS symptoms and inhibit viral replication. Ocimum sanctum, Tinospora cordifolia, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Panax ginseng, and Aloe vera have been identified for their immunomodulatory effects. This review highlights promising herbal molecules such as quercetin, and curcumin, which have demonstrated antiviral effects in–vitro and in some preclinical studies. While current treatment strategies for SARS primarily rely on supportive care and antiviral medications, the exploration of herbal molecules presents an exciting avenue for potential adjunctive therapies. Further research is required to validate their efficacy, safety profiles, and mechanisms of action. A holistic approach that combines conventional medicine with herbal remedies may offer new insights into the treatment of SARS and other viral respiratory illnesses.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) persist in many patients for weeks and months after recovery from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent evidence suggests that pathological changes in skeletal muscle may contribute significantly to ongoing pain and fatigue, particularly post-exertional malaise. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PASC-related fatigue by examining skeletal muscle function and circulating factors in affected individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of patients with fatigue-associated PASC who had experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and content in PASC participants compared to healthy controls. This lower respiratory capacity was accompanied by markedly elevated circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (sIL2R), a T cell-specific receptor. In vitro experiments demonstrated that sIL2R directly impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces mitochondrial complex III subunit protein levels in cultured muscle cells. These findings suggest a mechanism linking systemic immune dysregulation to muscle-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC. This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of PASC identifying sIL2R as a promising therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial deficits in PASC-related fatigue and opening avenues for developing targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Virus-infected cells secrete exosomes and other extracellular vesicles which could deliver viral components, including structural proteins and viral derived-ribonucleic acids to other cells. Released extracellular vesicles carry virus-specific receptors that increase the sensitivity of the target cells to viral infection. Exosomes may contribute to the systemic spreading of SARS-CoV-2 virus by transferring essential receptors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and CD9 that promote the ability of the virus to dock into the target cells. Subsequently, the SARS-CoV-2 virus might also enter into the exosomal pathway to use this system for packaging their components into exosomes for secretion. This study suggests that one of the potential explanations for the relapse and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection could be an endocytic transport pathway related to the secretion of COVID-19-loaded extracellular vesicles.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. Many expect future coronavirus introductions into the human population. Hence, it is essential to understand the basic biology of these viruses. In natural infection, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein is co-expressed with all other viral proteins, which modify cellular compartments to maximize virion assembly. By comparison, most of S is degraded when the protein is expressed in isolation, as in current molecular vaccines. To probe the maturation pathway of S, we redirected its maturation by fusing S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. CD81 is a defining constituent of extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes. EVs are generated in large numbers by all cells, extruded into blood and lymph, and transfer cargo between cells and systemically (estimated 1012 EVs per mL plasma). EVs, like platelets, can be transfused between unrelated donors. When fusing the proline-stabilized form of strain Delta S into the flexible, large extracellular loop of CD81 rather than being degraded in the lysosome, S was extruded into EVs. CD81-S fusion containing EVs were produced in large numbers and could be isolated to high purity. Purified CD81::S EVs bound ACE2, and S displayed on individual EV was observed by cryogenic electron microscopy (EM). The CD81::S-fusion EVs were non-toxic and elicited an anti-S trimer and anti-RBD antibody response in mice. This report shows a design path to maximize viral glycoprotein assembly and release without relying on the co-expression of potentially pathogenic nonstructural viral proteins. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. To understand the maturation pathway of S, we fused S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. The resulting molecule is secreted in extracellular vesicles and induces antibodies in mice. This may be a general design path for viral glycoprotein vaccines.">

        <tr id="Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes widespread changes in epigenetic modifications and chromatin architecture in the host cell. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) plays an important role in driving these changes. Previously thought to be primarily involved in host translation shutoff and cellular mRNA degradation, nsp1 has now been shown to be a truly multifunctional protein that affects host gene expression at multiple levels. The functions of nsp1 are surprisingly diverse and include not only the downregulation of cellular mRNA translation and stability, but also the inhibition of mRNA export from the nucleus, the suppression of host immune signaling, and, most recently, the epigenetic regulation of host gene expression. In this review, we first summarize the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-induced changes in epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure. We then focus on the role of nsp1 in epigenetic reprogramming, with a particular emphasis on the silencing of immune-related genes. Finally, we discuss potential molecular mechanisms underlying the epigenetic functions of nsp1 based on evidence from SARS-CoV-2 interactome studies.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a significant public health threat, particularly in children and older adults, with high mortality rates. Some of these pathogens are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza viruses (IV), human parvovirus B19 (B19V), and human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1). These viruses cause various respiratory symptoms, including cough, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Notably, these viruses can also impact the central nervous system (CNS), leading to acute manifestations such as seizures, encephalopathies, encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and long-term complications. The precise mechanisms by which these viruses affect the CNS are not fully understood. Glial cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes within the CNS, play pivotal roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and regulating immune responses. Exploring how these cells interact with viral pathogens, such as hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IVs, B19V, and HBoV1, offers crucial insights into the significant impact of respiratory viruses on the CNS. This review article examines hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IV, B19V, and HBoV1 interactions with microglia and astrocytes, shedding light on potential neurological consequences.">

However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

In this study, we prospectively investigate the dynamic changes of virus-specific antibody and T cell responses among 77 adolescents following Omicron BA.2.3 BTI with or without subsequent Omicron BA.5 RI. Notably, the neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) titers against various detected SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially the emerging Omicron CH.1.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, EG.5.1, and JN.1 subvariants, exhibited a significant decrease along the time. A lower level of IgG and NAbs titers post-BTI was found to be closely associated with subsequent RI. Elevated NAbs levels and shortened antigenic distances were observed following Omicron BA.5 RI. Robust T cell responses against both Omicron BA.2- and CH.1.1-spike peptides were observed at each point visited. The exposure to Omicron BA.5 promoted phenotypic differentiation of virus-specific memory T cells, even among the non-seroconversion adolescents. Therefore, updated vaccines are needed to provide effective protection against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants among adolescents.">

        <tr id="Microglia play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and display remarkable plasticity in their response to inflammatory stimuli. However, the specific signaling profiles that microglia adopt during such challenges remain incompletely understood. Traditional transcriptomic approaches provide valuable insights, but fail to capture dynamic post-translational changes. In this study, we utilized time-resolved single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to measure distinct signaling pathways activated in microglia upon exposure to bacterial and viral mimetics—lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the immunomodulatory role of astrocytes on microglial signaling in mixed cultures. Microglia or mixed cultures derived from neonatal mice were treated with LPS or Poly(I:C) for 48 hrs. Cultures were stained with a panel of 33 metal-conjugated antibodies targeting signaling and identity markers. High-dimensional clustering analysis was used to identify emergent signaling modules. We found that LPS treatment led to more robust early activation of pp38, pERK, pRSK, and pCREB compared to Poly(I:C). Despite these differences, both LPS and Poly(I:C) upregulated the classical activation markers CD40 and CD86 at later time-points. Strikingly, the presence of astrocytes significantly blunted microglial responses to both stimuli, particularly dampening CD40 upregulation. Our studies demonstrate that single-cell mass cytometry effectively captures the dynamic signaling landscape of microglia under pro-inflammatory conditions. This approach may pave the way for targeted therapeutic investigations of various neuroinflammatory disorders. Moreover, our findings underscore the necessity of considering cellular context, such as astrocyte presence, in interpreting microglial behavior during inflammation. Main Points Time-resolved single cell mass cytometry delineates microglial signaling pathways following LPS or Poly(I:C) treatment. Astrocyte presence led to selective reduction of key microglial signaling nodes along with terminal inflammatory profiles.">

        <tr id="The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and enduring impact, resulting in substantial loss of life. The scientific community has responded unprecedentedly by investigating various aspects of the crisis, particularly focusing on the acute phase of COVID-19. The roles of the viral load, cytokines, and chemokines during the acute phase and in the context of patients who experienced enduring symptoms upon infection, so called Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 or PASC, have been studied extensively. Here, in this review, we offer a virologist’s perspective on PASC, highlighting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, cytokines, and chemokines in different organs of patients across the full clinical spectrum of acute-phase disease. We underline that the probability of severe or critical disease progression correlates with increased viral load levels detected in the upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT), and plasma. Acute-phase viremia is a clear, although not unambiguous, predictor of PASC development. Moreover, both the quantity and diversity of functions of cytokines and chemokines increase with acute-phase disease severity. Specific cytokines remain or become elevated in the PASC phase, although the driving factor of ongoing inflammation found in patients with PASC remains to be investigated. The key findings highlighted in this review contribute to a further understanding of PASC and their differences and overlap with acute disease.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. 350,000 cases are reported annually in the U.S., although that number is expected to increase as climate change expands fungal geographic range. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the symptomatic 40% are often misdiagnosed due to similarities with bronchitis or pneumonia. A small subset of infection progress to severe illness, necessitating a better understanding of immune responses during lethal infection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we characterized lung responses during Coccidioides infection. We identified monocyte-derived Spp1-expressing macrophages as potential mediators of tissue remodeling and fibrosis, marked by high expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory transcripts. These macrophages showed elevated TGF-β and IL-6 signaling, pathways involved in fibrosis pathogenesis. Additionally, we observed significant neutrophil infiltration and defective lymphocyte responses, indicating severe adaptive immunity dysregulation in lethal, acute infection. These findings enhance our understanding of Coccidioides infection and suggest new therapeutic targets. Importance: Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, which is prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. With climate change potentially expanding the geographic range of this fungus, understanding the immune responses during severe infections is crucial. Our study used advanced techniques to analyze lung responses during Coccidioides infection, identifying specific immune cells that may contribute to tissue damage and fibrosis. These findings provide new insights into the disease mechanisms and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention, which could improve outcomes for patients suffering from severe Valley Fever.">

        <tr id="Waning immunity and the emergence of immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants jeopardize vaccine efficacy leading to breakthrough infections. We have previously shown that innate immune cells play a critical role in controlling SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the innate immune response during breakthrough infections, we modeled breakthrough infections by challenging low-dose vaccinated mice with a vaccine-mismatched SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. We found that low-dose vaccinated infected mice had a 2-log reduction in lung viral burden, but increased immune cell infiltration in the lung parenchyma, characterized by monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and eosinophils. Single cell RNA-seq revealed viral RNA was highly associated with eosinophils that corresponded to a unique IFN-γ biased signature. Antibody-mediated depletion of eosinophils in vaccinated mice resulted in increased virus replication and dissemination in the lungs, demonstrating that eosinophils in the lungs are protective during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. These results highlight the critical role for the innate immune response in vaccine mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Novel coronavirus disease 2019, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, initiate humoral and cellular immune responses against diverse virus antigens. The assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific is mainly carried out in routine practice by determining specific immunoglobulins. However, high variability in S-protein structure in new genovariants of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the lack of correlation between specific antibodies and CD8+ T-lymphocytes underlie false negative responses, and mass assessment of cellular immunity is complicated due to the complexity of applying ELISPOT and cytofluorometry techniques. To solve this issue, a diagnostic method was developed for assessing SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immune response, which is based on a skin test followed by evaluating a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction involving antigen-specific memory T-lymphocytes. A diagnostic preparation CoronaDerm-PS is based on Cord_PS, which is a hybrid recombinant protein consisting of parts of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, M, N, E. The specific activity of this chimeric antigen was analyzed in cultured T-lymphocyte activation test by assessing interferon-γ production using cytofluorometry. To investigate the chimeric antigen specific activity, a preclinical safety study with CoronaDerm-PS preparation in experimental animals was conducted. A dose-dependent developing skin reaction was observed in 90–100% of guinea pigs vaccinated by EpiVacCorona, CoviVac, Gam-COVID-Vac, which confirms a potential for assessing post-vaccination cellular immunity using CoronaDerm-PS preparation. Upon this, the presence of functionally active T-cell-antigenic epitopes in the recombinant polypeptide allows to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific response illustrated by detected response after Gam-COVID-Vac (S-protein) and EpiVacCorona (N-protein) vaccination. Thus, a skin test based on CoronaDerm-PS preparation may be a promising diagnostic tool for rapid mass screening requiring no specialized laboratory equipment for assessing populational SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Such a test is distinguished by advantages such as ease of analysis, high specificity and sensitivity. The final decision-making on using this test in a real-world practice may achieved after conducting further clinical safety and effectiveness trials.">

        <tr id="Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of S1 and receptor binding domain protein-specific B cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations. This study aimed to evaluate the role and developmental pathway of atypical memory B cells (MBCs) in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The results revealed a proinflammatory signature across B cell subsets associated with disease severity, as evidenced by the upregulation of genes such as GADD45B, MAP3K8, and NFKBIA in critical and severe individuals. Furthermore, the analysis of atypical MBCs suggested a developmental pathway similar to that of conventional MBCs through germinal centers, as indicated by the expression of several genes involved in germinal center processes, including CXCR4, CXCR5, BCL2, and MYC. Additionally, the upregulation of genes characteristic of the immune response in COVID-19, such as ZFP36 and DUSP1, suggested that the differentiation and activation of atypical MBCs may be influenced by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and that these genes may contribute to the immune response for COVID-19 recovery. Our study contributes to a better understanding of atypical MBCs in COVID-19 and the role of other B cell subsets across different clinical manifestations.">

        <tr id="While several viral infections have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the mechanism(s) through which they promote disease has remained almost entirely elusive. This study investigated the impact of common, acute viral infections prior to disease onset on ALS progression in the SOD1G93A mouse model. A single sublethal infection prior to onset of ALS clinical signs was associated with markedly accelerated ALS disease progression characterized by rapid loss of hindlimb function. Prior infection resulted in gliosis in the lumbar spine and upregulation of transcriptional pathways involved in inflammatory responses, metabolic dysregulation, and muscular dysfunction. Therapeutic suppression of gliosis with an anti-inflammatory small molecule, or administration of a direct-acting antiviral, was associated with significantly improved ALS clinical signs, akin to what was observed in uninfected animals. This study provides causal and mechanistic evidence that the immune response elicited by acute viral infections may be an important etiological factor that alters ALS disease trajectory, and provides insight into novel therapeutic and preventative strategies for ALS.

        <tr id="Microglia, the resident phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), continuously monitor the parenchyma and surrounding borders and are the primary responders to brain damage. CD300f is a lipid-sensing immunoreceptor present in the microglial cell membrane, which binds to phosphatidylserine and other lipid mediators. Defining the functional microglial sensome is critical to understand their function and cell state determination. Using intravital two-photon microscopy we show that microglia lacking the CD300f receptor fail to detect environmental damage cues after a laser ablation injury. After a mild traumatic brain injury or after the intracortical injection of apoptotic cells, CD300f-/- microglia showed reduced capacity for detecting and phagocytosing dyeing cells, leading to the accumulation of dead cells in the neural parenchyma. Moreover, at later timepoints, increased accumulation of dyeing cells was found inside CD300f-/- microglia in vivo and in bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro, suggesting that these cells display a reduced capacity for metabolizing phagocytosed cells. Finally, CD300f deficiency increased functional compromise after a contusive traumatic brain injury, associated to increased conservation of brain tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that CD300f function as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptor that coordinates microglial process reaction towards tissue debris and highlights its central role in microglial sensome machinery and in the modulation of in vivo microglial efferocytosis.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can increase the risk of neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegenerative diseases. Certain IAV strains, such as avian H7N7 subtype, possess neurotropic properties, enabling them to directly invade the brain parenchyma and infect neurons and glia cells. Host sex significantly influences the severity of IAV infections. Studies indicate that females of the reproductive age exhibit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses to IAVs compared to males. This heightened immune response correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, and potential neuronal damage in females. Understanding the sex-specific neurotropism of IAV and associated mechanisms leading to adverse neurological outcomes is essential. Our study reveals that primary hippocampal cultures from female mice show heightened interferon-β and pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion following neurotropic IAV infection. We observed sex-specific differences in microglia activation: both sexes showed a transition into a hyper-ramified state, but only male-derived microglia exhibited an increase in amoeboid-shaped cells. These disparities extended to alterations in neuronal morphology. Neurons derived from female mice displayed increased spine density within 24 h post-infection, while no significant change was observed in male cultures. This aligns with sex-specific differences in microglial synaptic pruning. Data suggest that amoeboid-shaped microglia preferentially target postsynaptic terminals, potentially reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Conversely, hyper-ramified microglia may focus on presynaptic terminals, potentially limiting viral spread. In conclusion, our findings underscore the utility of primary hippocampal cultures, incorporating microglia, as an effective model to study sex-specific, virus-induced effects on brain-resident cells.">

The production of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are physiologically involved in cell communication, is also altered during COVID-19, along with the dysfunction of cytoplasmic organelles. Since circulating EVs reflect the state of their cells of origin, they represent valuable tools for monitoring pathological conditions. Despite challenges in detecting EVs due to their size and specific cellular compartment origin using different methodologies, flow cytometry has proven to be an effective method for assessing the role of EVs in COVID-19. This review summarizes the involvement of plasmatic EVs in COVID-19 patients and individuals with Long COVID (LC) affected by post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), highlighting their dual role in exerting both pro- and antiviral effects. We also emphasize how flow cytometry, with its multiparametric approach, can be employed to characterize circulating EVs, particularly in infectious diseases such as COVID-19, and suggest their potential role in chronic impairments during post-infection.">

The accelerated advancements in antiviral drug discovery, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, have shed new light on the imperative to develop treatments effective against a broad spectrum of CoVs. This perspective discusses strategies and lessons learnt in targeting viral non-structural proteins, structural proteins, drug repurposing, and combinational approaches for the development of antivirals against CoVs.


EXPERT OPINION
Drawing lessons from the pandemic, it becomes evident that the absence of efficient broad-spectrum antiviral drugs increases the vulnerability of public health systems to the potential onslaught by highly pathogenic CoVs. The rapid and sustained spread of novel CoVs can have devastating consequences without effective and specifically targeted treatments. Prioritizing the effective development of broad-spectrum antivirals is imperative for bolstering the resilience of public health systems and mitigating the potential impact of future highly pathogenic CoVs.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus infected more than 775,686,716 humans and was responsible for the death of more than 7,054,093 individuals. COVID-19 has taught us that the development of vaccines, repurposing of drugs, and understanding the mechanism of a disease can be done within a short time. The COVID-19 proteomics and metabolomics has contributed to its diagnosis, understanding of its progression, host-virus interaction, disease mechanism, and also in the search of suitable anti-COVID therapeutics. Mass spectrometry based proteomics was used to find the potential biomarkers of different stages of COVID-19 including severe and nonsevere cases in the blood serum. Notably, protein-protein interaction techniques to understand host-virus interactions were also significantly useful. The single-cell proteomics studies were carried out to ascertain the changes in immune cell composition and its activation in mild COVID-19 patients versus severe COVID-19 patients using whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Modern technologies were helpful to deal with the pandemic; however, there is still scope for further development. Further, attempts were made to understand the protein-protein, metabolite-metabolite, and protein-metabolite interactomes, derived from proteins and metabolite fingerprints of COVID-19 patients by reanalysis of COVID-19 public mass spectrometry based proteomics and metabolomics studies. Further, some of these interactions were supported by the literature as validations in the COVID-19 studies.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant exhibits high transmissibility with a strong immune escape ability and causes frequent large-scale global infections by producing predominant subvariants. Here, using human upper/lower airway and intestinal cells, we examined the previously dominant BA.1-BA.5 and BA.2.75 subvariants, together with the recently emerged XBB/BQ lineages, in comparison to the former Delta variant. We observed a tendency for each virus to demonstrate higher growth capability than the previously dominant subvariants. Unlike human bronchial and intestinal cells, nasal epithelial cells accommodated the efficient entry of certain Omicron subvariants, similar to the Delta variant. In contrast to the Delta's reliance on cell-surface transmembrane protease serine 2, all tested Omicron variants depended on endosomal cathepsin L. Moreover, S1/S2 cleavage of early Omicron spikes was less efficient, whereas recent viruses exhibit improved cleavage efficacy. Our results show that the Omicron variant progressively adapts to human cells through continuous endosome-mediated host cell entry.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, has evolved into a number of variants/subvariants, which have generated multiple global waves of infection. In order to monitor/predict virological features of emerging variants and determine appropriate strategies for anti-viral development, understanding conserved or altered features of evolving SARS-CoV-2 is important. In this study, we addressed previously or recently predominant Omicron subvariants and demonstrated the gradual adaptation to human cells. The host cell entry route, which was altered from the former Delta variant, was conserved among all tested Omicron subvariants. Collectively, this study revealed both changing and maintained features of SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron variant evolution.">

        <tr id="The global Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has indeed seen the emergence of multiple variants. There are several direct-acting antiviral drugs that have been approved or are in process of advancing through clinical development for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The oral antiviral medications offer several advantages over intravenous(IV) antivirals, including enhanced safety and the ability to administer during the early stages of the disease to potentially prevent hospitalization. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) for an oral antiviral medications Molnupiravir, Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir and VV116 specially intended for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients at risk of progressing to severe disease. These three mentioned drugs serve different purposes - Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, Nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor and Ritonavir is used as a protease inhibitor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1. VV116 is a promising oral nucleoside drug candidate with the potential to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, reduce viral RNA levels and limit the presence of infectious virus. The findings are consistent with the observation that the target proteins of the mentioned antiviral drugs, specifically the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the viral main protease are highly conserved. This suggests that these antivirals may be effective against a broad range of viral strains due to the conservation of their target proteins.">

        <tr id="MPOX virus (MPXV), formerly known as monkeypox virus, led to a rapidly evolving pandemic starting May 2022, with over 90,000 cases reported beyond the African continent. This pandemic outbreak was driven by the MPXV variant Clade IIb. In addition, Clade I viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are drawing increased attention as cases constantly rise and Clade Ib, first identified in 2023, is now co-circulating with Clade Ia and seems to exhibit enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. While most infected individuals display a self-limiting disease with singular pox-like lesions, some endure systemic viral spread leading to whole-body rash with risks for necrosis, organ loss, and death. Intra-host dissemination and cellular tropism of MPXV are largely unexplored in humans. To establish a potential susceptibility of circulating immune cells to MPXV, we exposed human PBMCs from healthy donors ex vivo to a currently circulating MPXV clade IIb virus isolate in absence and presence of IFN-α2a. qPCR of DNA extracted from cell lysates, but less from supernatants, revealed increasing MPXV DNA quantities that peaked at five to six days post-exposure, suggesting susceptibility of PBMCs to infection. IFN-α2a pretreatment markedly reduced the quantity of MPXV DNA, suggesting that infection is sensitive to type I IFNs. Plaque assays from supernatants showed that infection gave rise to de novo production of infectious MPXV. In virus-inclusive scRNA-sequencing, monocytes, cycling NK cells and regulatory CD4+ T-cells scored positive for viral RNA, suggesting that these are the MPXV-susceptible cell types within the human PBMC population. Analysis of differentially expressed genes displayed a pronounced downregulation of expression pathways driving innate immunity in MPXV-infected cells, a well-established feature of poxviral infection. Pretreatment of PBMCs with current antivirals Cidofovir and Tecovirimat resulted in reduced amounts of viral antigen production and of released infectivity, suggesting suitability of the human PBMC infection model as a platform for evaluation of current and future antivirals and justifying trials to investigate Cidofovir and Tecovirimat as drugs reducing intra-patient viral spread. Together, our data suggest that human PBMCs are productively infected by MPXV which is accompanied by significant modulation of the cellular milieu. Our results have the potential to illuminate aspects of intra-host propagation of MPXV that may involve a lymphohematogenous route for replication and/or intra-host dissemination.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and establish a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12 days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the homeostatic and preactivated microglia population decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.">

        <tr id="Risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 include several comorbidities, but age was the most striking one since elderly people were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the reasons for this markedly unfavorable response in the elderly, immunosenescence and inflammaging appear as major drivers of this outcome. A finding that was also notable was that hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 have an accumulation of senescent T cells, suggesting that immunosenescence may be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present work was designed to examine whether these immunosenescence changes are characteristic of COVID-19 and whether it is dependent on disease severity using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our cross-sectional data show that COVID-19, but not other respiratory infections, rapidly increased cellular senescence and exhaustion in CD4 and CD8 T cells during early infection. In addition, longitudinal analyses with patients from Brazil and Portugal provided evidence of increased frequencies of senescent and exhausted T cells over a 7-d period in patients with mild/moderate and severe COVID-19. Altogether, the study suggests that accelerated immunosenescence in CD4 and especially CD8 T-cell compartments may represent a common and unique outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection.">

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: In this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n=204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Results: Plasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants harboring mutations in the structural protein, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, have raised concern about potential immune escape. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in infection and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies. The mutations that occur in the structural proteins, especially in the spike protein, lead to changes in the virus attributes of transmissibility, an increase in disease severity, a notable reduction in neutralizing antibodies generated and thus a decreased response to vaccines and therapy. The observed multiple mutations in the RBD of the spike protein showed immune escape because it increases the affinity of spike protein binding with the ACE-2 receptor of host cells and increases resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections from the infected tissues and clearing them from circulation. Cytotoxic T cells efficiently recognized the infected cells and killed them by releasing soluble mediator's perforin and granzymes. However, the overwhelming response of T cells and, subsequently, the overproduction of inflammatory mediators during severe infections with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to poor outcomes. This review article summarizes the impact of mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations of RBD, on immunogenicity, immune escape and vaccine-induced immunity, which could contribute to future studies focusing on vaccine design and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019, a diversity of viral genomic variants has emerged and spread globally due to increased transmissibility, pathogenicity, and immune evasion. By the first trimester of 2023 in Chile, as in most countries, BQ and XBB were the predominant circulating sub-lineages of Omicron. The molecular and antigenic characteristics of these variants have been mainly determined using non-authentic spike pseudoviruses, which is often described as a limitation. Additionally, few comparative studies using isolates from recent Omicron sub-lineages have been conducted. In this study, we isolated SARS-CoV-2 variants from clinical samples, including the ancestral B.1.1, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and sub-lineages of BA.2 and BA.5. We assessed their infectivity through cell culture infections and their antibody evasion using neutralization assays. We observed variations in viral plaque size, cell morphology, and cytotoxicity upon infection in Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells for each variant compared to the ancestral B.1.1 virus. BA.2-derived sub-variants, such as XBB.1.5, showed attenuated viral replication, while BA.5-derived variants, such as BQ.1.1, exhibited replication rates similar to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus. Similar trends were observed in intestinal Caco-2 cells, except for Delta. Antibody neutralization experiments using sera from individuals infected during the first COVID-19 wave (FWI) showed a consistent but moderate reduction in neutralization against Omicron sub-lineages. Interestingly, despite being less prevalent, BQ.1.1 showed a 6.1-fold greater escape from neutralization than XBB.1.5. Neutralization patterns were similar when tested against sera from individuals vaccinated with 3xBNT162b2 (PPP) or Coronavac-Coronavac-BNT162b2 (CCP) schedules. However, CCP sera showed 2.3-fold higher neutralization against XBB.1.5 than FWI and PPP sera. This study provides new insights into the differences between BA.2 and BA.5-derived variants, leading to their eventual outcompetition. Our analysis offers important evidence regarding the balance between infectivity and antigenic escape that drives the evolution of second-generation SARS-CoV-2 variants in the population.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the critical need to integrate immunomics within the One Health framework to effectively address zoonotic diseases across humans, animals, and environments. Employing advanced high-throughput technologies, this interdisciplinary approach reveals the complex immunological interactions among these systems, enhancing our understanding of immune responses and yielding vital insights into the mechanisms that influence viral spread and host susceptibility. Significant advancements in immunomics have accelerated vaccine development, improved viral mutation tracking, and broadened our comprehension of immune pathways in zoonotic transmissions. This review highlights the role of animals, not merely as carriers or reservoirs, but as essential elements of ecological networks that profoundly influence viral epidemiology. Furthermore, we explore how environmental factors shape immune response patterns across species, influencing viral persistence and spillover risks. Moreover, case studies demonstrating the integration of immunogenomic data within the One Health framework for COVID-19 are discussed, outlining its implications for future research. However, linking humans, animals, and the environment through immunogenomics remains challenging, including the complex management of vast amounts of data and issues of scalability. Despite challenges, integrating immunomics data within the One Health framework significantly enhances our strategies and responses to zoonotic diseases and pandemic threats, marking a crucial direction for future public health breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Background Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in virus control. However, it has remained largely unclear whether NK cell mobilization in SARS-CoV-2 infections is beneficial or pathologic. To address this deficit, we employed a validated experimental NK cell depletion non-human primate (NHP) model with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant B.1.617.2 challenge. Viral loads (VL), NK cell numbers, activation, proliferation, and functional measures were evaluated in blood and tissues. In non-depleted (control) animals, infection rapidly induced NK cell expansion, activation, and increased tissue trafficking associated with VL. Strikingly, we report that experimental NK cell depletion leads to higher VL, longer duration of viral shedding, significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and overt lung damage. Overall, we find the first significant and conclusive evidence for NK cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and disease pathology. These data indicate that adjunct therapies for infection could largely benefit from NK cell-targeted approaches.">

        <tr id="Public health systems reported low mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in East Asia, in low-income countries, and for children during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These reports led commentators to suggest that cross-reactive immunity from prior exposure to other pathogens reduced fatality risk. Resolution of initial infection waves also contributed to speculation that herd immunity prevented further waves prior to vaccination. Serology instead implied that immunity was too limited to achieve herd immunity and that there was little impact from cross-reactive protection. Paediatric deaths exceeded those from influenza, with higher age-specific fatality risk in lower-income nations and similar fatality risk in East Asia compared with demographically similar regions. Neither pre-outbreak exposure to related pathogens nor immunity induced by initial infection waves are necessarily a reliable response to future pathogen outbreaks. Preparedness for future pathogen outbreaks should instead focus on strategies such as voluntary behavioural changes, nonpharmaceutical interventions, and vaccination.">

        <tr id="We previously demonstrated that the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients were filled with a clear hydrogel consisting of hyaluronan (HA). In this translational study, we investigated the role of HA at all stages of COVID-19 disease to map the consequences of elevated HA on morbidity and identify the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced HA production. A reduced alveolar surface area was observed in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, as visualized by a 3D rendering of lung morphology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. We confirmed the presence of HA in lung biopsies and found large quantities of proinflammatory fragmented HA. The association of systemic HA in blood plasma and disease severity was assessed in patients with mild (WHO Clinical Progression Scale, WHO-CPS, 1-5) and severe COVID-19 (WHO-CPS, 6-9) during the acute and convalescent phases and related to lung function. We found that systemic levels of HA were high during acute COVID-19 disease, remained elevated during convalescence, and were associated with a reduced diffusion capacity. In vitro 3D-lung models, differentiated from primary human bronchial epithelial cells, were used to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HA metabolism, and transcriptomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of HA synthases and hyaluronidases, both contributing to increased HA in apical secretions. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment reduced the inflammation and downregulated HA synthases. Our findings demonstrate that HA plays a role in COVID-19 morbidity and that sustained elevated HA concentrations may contribute to long-term respiratory impairment.IMPORTANCEThis study provides insights into the role of hyaluronan (HA) in the severity and long-term impact of COVID-19 on lung function. Through extensive morphological examination of lung tissues and a multicenter study, we identified that HA levels are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, correlating with a reduced lung diffusion capacity during convalescence. Using a 3D-lung model, we further uncovered how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a dysregulated HA metabolism, leading to increased HA production. Our findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting HA metabolism could offer new therapeutic avenues for managing COVID-19, particularly to prevent long-term lung impairment. Additionally, HA holds potential as a biomarker for predicting disease severity, which could guide personalized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Massive infections of people with the previously unidentified SARS-CoV-2 virus have been a shock to the global healthcare system. While many studies have focused on the clinical manifestations of the disease and its treatment methods, understanding the molecular and genetic aspects of infection has proved critical to understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction. The scientists focused on issues of gene expression and their regulation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, we conducted a study of gene expression within the framework of the project «COVID-19: Scientific and technological justification of the response system to the spread of new respiratory infections, including coronavirus infection», the results of which are presented in the article [1].Hence, variations in the gene expression profiles of TLR 3 (Toll-Like receptor), TLR 7, TLR 4, ACE 2 (Angiotensing converting enzyme), TMPRSS 13 (Transmembrane serine protease), INF-Ɣ (Interferon gamma), and IL 4 (Interleukin) were discerned across all investigated cohorts, including those assessed six months post-recovery. There is a complex of pathways of immune system to defense with the infection including the involvement of toll-like receptor signaling pathways which contact of viral particles. Moreover, the surge in ACE2 expression demonstrates the multifunctional role as gates for Sars-Cov-2 to enter cells and activation of innate immunity responses. Although, the upregulation of INF-Ɣ and IL-4 as proinflammatory cytokines were contributed to the initiation and the progression of the cytokine storm.">

        <tr id="Plasmablasts are a population of short-lived B cells that appear in the circulation shortly after vaccination and during acute infection. Plasmablasts are formed from resting B lymphocytes, from which they differ in their ability to secrete antibodies, making them similar to plasma cells. Plasmablasts are terminally differentiated cells that can form at various nodes and branches of the B cell response. The plasmablast response is an indicator of the success of vaccination and also helps in predicting antibody levels after recovery or vaccination. However, the definition and classification of plasmablasts faces great experimental and theoretical difficulties. The aim of the work was to determine the characteristics of the plasmablast response during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study included patients (n = 28) with a severe form of COVID-19. Blood sampling was carried out once on the 10–18th day from the moment of hospitalization. B cells were isolated by immunomagnetic separation. Cells were phenotyped using flow cytometry. Secretion of IgM and IgG was determined by ELISpot method. B cell subsets were isolated using a cell sorter. Patients with COVID-19 had an approximately fourfold increase in total plasmablast levels compared to healthy donors. An even more pronounced excess over the negative control was observed for RBD-specific plasmablasts. In terms of their composition, plasmablasts were one third IgM⁺ cells. This distribution between B-cell BCR receptor isotypes was consistent with the primary nature of the immune response in COVID-19. Approximately a third of plasmablasts carried the CD138 antigen. CD138 marker is characteristic of the late stage of plasmablast maturation and is also found on plasma cells. The CD27+CD38⁺ population was divided according to the expression of the CD138 antigen. Using the ELISpot method, we have shown that a significant portion of circulating plasmablasts are antibody-secreting cells. Among circulating plasmablasts, both early and late plasmablasts can be distinguished, which are characterized by the absence of a surface BCR, but which carry the CD138 antigen. Determining how plasmablasts relate to other B cell populations is of paramount importance for the development of new treatments for COVID-19 and for the creation of promising vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Respiratory fungal infections pose a significant threat to human health. Animal models do not fully recapitulate human disease, necessitating advanced models to study human-fungal pathogen interactions. In this study, we utilized primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) to recapitulate the lung environment in vitro and investigate cellular responses to two diverse, clinically significant fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. To understand the mechanisms of early pathogenesis for both fungi, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of infected hAECs. Analysis revealed that both fungi induced cellular stress and cytokine production. However, the cell subtypes affected and specific pathways differed between fungi, with A. fumigatus and C. posadasii triggering protein-folding-related stress in ciliated cells and hypoxia responses in secretory cells, respectively. This study represents one of the first reports of single-cell transcriptional analysis of hAECs infected with either A. fumigatus or C. posadasii, providing a vital dataset to dissect the mechanism of disease and potentially identify targetable pathways. Importance Fungal infections in the lungs are dreaded complications for those with compromised immune systems and have limited treatment strategies available. These options are restricted further by the increased prevalence of treatment-resistant fungi. Many studies focus on how our immune systems respond to these pathogens, yet airway epithelial cells remain an understudied component of fungal infections in the lungs. Here, the authors provide a transcriptional analysis of primary human airway epithelial cells stimulated by two distinct fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. These data will enable further mechanistic studies of the contribution of the airway epithelium to initial host responses and represent a powerful new resource for investigators.">

        <tr id="Neutrophilia occurs in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and is predictive of poor outcomes. Here, we link heterogenous neutrophil populations to disease severity in COVID-19. We identified neutrophils with features of cellular aging and immunosuppressive capacity in mild COVID-19 and features of neutrophil immaturity and activation in severe disease. The low-density neutrophil (LDN) number in circulating blood correlated with COVID-19 severity. Many of the divergent neutrophil phenotypes in COVID-19 were overrepresented in the LDN fraction and were less detectable in normal-density neutrophils. Functionally, neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 displayed defects in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species production. Soluble factors secreted by neutrophils from these patients inhibited T cell proliferation. Neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 had increased expression of arginase-1 protein, a feature that was retained in convalescent patients. Despite this increase in intracellular expression, there was a reduction in arginase-1 release by neutrophils into serum and culture supernatants. Furthermore, neutrophil-mediated T cell suppression was independent of arginase-1. Our results indicate the presence of dysfunctional, activated, and immature neutrophils in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Among respiratory viruses, the most serious complications are caused by influenza A and B viruses, as well as coronaviruses. Most studies determined the absolute content of interferons (IFNs) of different types in blood serum. However, serum IFN protein concentrations do not always reflect the level of antiviral protection. The purpose of this study was a comparative assessment of interferon status in patients with ARVI: influenza and the acute stage of COVID-19. Materials and methods. We used biomaterial in the form of whole blood samples from 113 patients with influenza and 110 patients in the acute phase of moderate COVID-19. The body’s antiviral defense during ARVI was assessed by determining the activity of type I and II interferons produced by blood leukocytes using the “Interferon status” method in a cell-virus system simulated in vitro. Results. This work reveals a statistically significant decrease in the biological activity of interferons produced by blood leukocytes in influenza and a deficiency of IFN activity in COVID-19, compared with reference values, and also shows possible prospects for the treatment of these nosologies with such immunoactive drugs as IFN inducers (cycloferon, Kagocel) and immunomodulators (ingavirin, multicomponent vaccine Immunovac-VP-4). Conclusion. The results of IFN activity are necessary to assess the antiviral potential of the body, especially with COVID-19, given the “novelty” of the infection, the severity and variety of its clinical manifestations. Today it is known that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is capable of penetrating not only into the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, epithelial cells of the stomach and intestines, but also into the cells of the esophagus, heart, adrenal glands, bladder, brain, as well as into the vascular endothelium and macrophages. Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 inhibits the expression of cellular genes, including innate immune genes, and has a negative effect on the IFN system. The use of IFN inducers and immunomodulators for influenza and COVID-19 has shown immunological feasibility and clinical promise.">

        <tr id="Abstract Patients with long COVID can develop humoral autoimmunity after severe acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, whether similar increases in autoantibody responses occur after mild infection and whether vaccination prior to SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection can limit autoantibody responses is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that mild SARS-CoV-2 infection increases autoantibodies associated with rheumatic autoimmune diseases and diabetes in most individuals, regardless of vaccination status prior to infection. However, patients with long COVID and persistent neurologic and fatigue symptoms (neuro-PASC) have substantially higher autoantibody responses than convalescent control subjects at an average of 8 mo postinfection. Furthermore, high titers of systemic lupus erythematosus– and CNS-associated autoantibodies in patients with neuro-PASC are associated with impaired cognitive performance and greater symptom severity. In summary, we found that mild SARS-CoV-2 primary and breakthrough infections can induce persistent humoral autoimmunity in both patients with neuro-PASC and healthy COVID convalescents, suggesting that a reappraisal of mitigation strategies against SARS-CoV-2 is warranted to prevent transmission and potential development of autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="Introduction The immunological characteristics that could protect children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from severe or fatal illnesses have not been fully understood yet. Methods Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on peripheral blood samples of 15 children (8 with COVID-19) and compared them to 18 adults (13 with COVID-19). Results The child-adult integrated single cell data indicated that children with the disease presented a restrained response to type I interferon in most of the major immune cell types, along with suppression of upstream interferon regulatory factor and toll-like receptor expression in monocytes, which was confirmed by in vitro interferon stimulation assays. Unlike adult patients, children with COVID-19 showed lower frequencies of activated proinflammatory CD14+ monocytes, possibly explaining the rareness of cytokine storm in them. Notably, natural killer (NK) cells in pediatric patients displayed potent cytotoxicity with a rich expression of cytotoxic molecules and upregulated cytotoxic pathways, whereas the cellular senescence, along with the Notch signaling pathway, was significantly downregulated in NK cells, all suggesting more robust cytotoxicity in NK cells of children than adult patients that was further confirmed by CD107a degranulation assays. Lastly, a modest adaptive immune response was evident with more naïve T cells but less activated and proliferated T cells while less naïve B cells but more activated B cells in children over adult patients. Conclusion Conclusively, this preliminary study revealed distinct cell frequency and activation status of major immune cell types, particularly more robust NK cell cytotoxicity in PBMC that might help protect children from severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a neurotropic member of the genus Orthoflavivirus (former Flavivirus) and is of significant health concern in Europe and Asia. TBEV pathogenesis may occur directly via virus-induced damage to neurons or through immunopathology due to excessive inflammation. While primary cells isolated from the host can be used to study the immune response to TBEV, it is still unclear how well these reflect the immune response elicited in vivo. Here, we compared the transcriptional response to TBEV and the less pathogenic tick-borne flavivirus, Langat virus (LGTV), in primary monocultures of neurons, astrocytes and microglia in vitro, with the transcriptional response in vivo captured by single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of a whole mouse cortex. We detected similar transcriptional changes induced by both LGTV and TBEV infection in vitro, with the lower response to LGTV likely resulting from slower viral kinetics. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a stronger transcriptional response in vivo than in vitro for astrocytes and microglia, with a limited overlap mainly dominated by interferon signaling. Together, this adds to our understanding of neurotropic flavivirus pathogenesis and the strengths and limitations of available model systems.">

        <tr id="Mucosal immunity plays a crucial role in defending against coronaviruses, particularly at respiratory sites, serving as the first line of defense against viral invasion and replication. Coronaviruses have developed various immune evasion strategies at the mucosal immune system, hindering the recognition of infected cells and evading antibody responses. Understanding the immune mechanisms and responses is crucial for developing effective vaccines and therapeutics against coronaviruses. The role of mucosal immunity in COVID-19 is significant, influencing both local and systemic immune responses to the virus. Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Mucosally delivered vaccines and those under clinical trials are being compared and contrasted to understand their effectiveness in inducing mucosal immunity against coronaviruses. A greater understanding of lung tissue-based immunity may lead to improved diagnostic and prognostic procedures and novel treatment strategies aimed at reducing the disease burden of community-acquired pneumonia, avoiding the systemic manifestations of infection and excess morbidity and mortality. This comprehensive review article outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. It also proposes that there is a significant role for mucosal immunity and for secretory as well as circulating IgA antibodies in COVID-19, and that it is important to elucidate this in order to comprehend especially the asymptomatic and mild states of the infection, which appear to account for the majority of cases. Moreover, it is possible that mucosal immunity can be exploited for beneficial diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes. The findings from recent studies on mucosal immunity in COVID-19 can be used to develop effective vaccines and treatments that can effectively target both mucosal and systemic immune responses.">

        <tr id="A series of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory disease was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Many patients have had direct or indirect links with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Wuhan. This is the prologue to the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has affected more than 150 countries and over 250,000 people worldwide, killing thousands of people. The pandemic has once again drawn public attention to the coronaviruses that developed epidemics in China (2002) and Saudi Arabia (2012). Given the structural and phylogenetic similarity of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the results of recent studies have been combined with new findings to complete one of the strangest pneumonia puzzles in the human history. Coronaviruses establish extremely complex interactions with the immune system, especially in order to evade immune responses. Undoubtedly, increasing our knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of diseases caused by these viruses will eventually lead to more effective treatment and diagnosis. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are among the leading immune response regulators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the expression and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses and in many immune disorders from autoimmunity to cancer and allergies. Our understanding of the functions of human and viral miRNAs in the pathogenesis of many viruses has increased in recent years. Accordingly, the present review article aims to review studies evaluating the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of other Betacoronaviruses. The results of these studies, given the similarity of viruses within the family Coronaviridae, could be helpful for future research on SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="A severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifests as systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement is called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). This review examines the possible relationship between gut barrier integrity, the microbiome, dysregulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling, and MIS-C. Clinical and biochemical features of MIS-C are comparable to those of other hyper-inflammatory syndromes, suggesting a dysregulated immune response. One possible explanation for the systemic inflammation seen in MIS-C patients is the SARS-CoV-2-induced dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathway. In addition, new data suggest a reciprocal link between gut barrier integrity and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits bacteriophage-like behavior, highlighting the role of bacteria as a reservoir for the virus and emphasizing the importance of understanding the bacteriophagic mechanism of the virus in fecal–oral transmission. The increased translocation of viral products and bacterial toxins may result from disrupting the intestinal barrier and cause systemic inflammation. On the other hand, systemic inflammation can weaken the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which feeds back into the loop of immunological dysregulation. In the context of MIS-C, understanding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection, IL-6, and gut barrier integrity may shed light on the etiology of the disease and guide treatment options. Since children with gut dysbiosis may be more susceptible to MIS-C, it is critical to reinforce their microbiome through probiotics supplementation, and plant-fiber-rich diets (prebiotics). Early antibiotic treatment and the use of zonulin antagonists should also be considered.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has been a global health concern since 2007. It primarily causes fetal microcephaly and neuronal defects through maternal transmission and induces neurological complications in adults. Recent studies report elevated proinflammatory cytokines and persistent neurological alterations post recovery, but the in vivo mechanisms remain unclear. In our study, viral RNA loads in the brains of mice infected with ZIKV peaked at 7 days post infection and returned to baseline by day 21, indicating recovery. RNA sequencing of the cerebral cortex at 7 and 21 days revealed upregulated genes related to neuroinflammation and microglial activation. Histological analyses indicated neuronal cell death and altered neurite morphology owing to severe neuroinflammation. Additionally, sustained microglial activation was associated with increased phospho-Tau levels, constituting a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings highlight how persistent microglial activation leads to neuronal dysfunction post ZIKV recovery, providing insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced brain abnormalities.">

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

        <tr id="The lung is constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and particles that can cause alveolar damage. Hence, appropriate repair responses are essential for gas exchange and life. Here, we deciphered the spatiotemporal trajectory and function of an atypical population of macrophages after lung injury. Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry.We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients.The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an unparalleled health risk, needing fast antiviral medication development. One of the most effective strategies for developing therapies against novel and emerging viruses is drug repurposing. Recently, systems biology approaches toward the discovery of repurposing medications are gaining prominence.


AIM
This study aimed to implement a systems biology approach to identify crucial drug targets as well as potential drug candidates against COVID infection.


METHODS
Our approach utilizes differential gene expression in COVID conditions that enable the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Core clusters were extracted from this network, followed by molecular enrichment analysis. This process identified critical drug targets and potential drug candidates targeting various stages of COVID-19 infection.


RESULTS
The network was built using the top 200 differently expressed genes in mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 infections. Top 3 clusters for each disease condition were identified, representing the core mechanism of the network. Molecular enrichment revealed the majority of the pathways in the mild state were associated with transcription regulation, protein folding, angiogenesis, and cytokine-signaling pathways. Whereas, the enriched pathways in moderate and severe disease states were predominately linked with the immune system and apoptotic processes, which include NF-kappaB signaling, cytokine signaling, TNF-mediated signaling, and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Further analysis identifies 28 potential drugs that can be repurposed to treat moderate and severe COVID-19, most of which are currently used in cancer treatment.


CONCLUSION
Interestingly, some of the proposed drugs have demonstrated inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2, as supported by literature evidence. Overall, the drug repurposing method described here will help develop potential antiviral medications to treat emerging COVID strains.">

 Premature vascular aging and endothelial cell senescence are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and atherothrombotic disturbances, which are main complications of both acute and long COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which forms the crown of the coronavirus, can induce endothelial cells inflammation and has been found as an isolated element in both the circulation and human tissues reservoirs months after infection. The aim of this study was to investigate whether S protein is able to directly induce endothelial cell senescence and endothelial dysfunction and to decipher some of the mechanisms involved in such deleterious effect.



 Using primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), cellular senescence was assessed by senescence-associated-β galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining and the quantification of DNA damage response markers (γH2AX) and growth-arrest effectors (p53, p21, p16) by Western blot. Cytoprotective proteins were equally determined by Western blot. In isolated murine mesenteric microvessel, myography was used to assess defective vascular relaxation, as a key marker of endothelial dysfunction.



 In primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), SARS-CoV-2 S protein enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner from a threshold of 35 nmol/L the cellular content of senescence and DNA damage response markers, as well as growth-arrest effectors. In parallel, the S protein reduced the availability of cytoprotective proteins, such as the anti-aging protein klotho, Nrf2 or heme oxygenase-1, and caused functional harm by impairing ex vivo endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in murine microvessels. These effects were prevented by the pharmacological inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950. Furthermore, the supplementation with either recombinant klotho or angiotensin-(1-7), equally protected against the pro-senescence, pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant action of the S protein.



 Globally, this study proposes novel mechanisms of disease in the context of COVID-19 and its vascular sequelae and provides pharmacological clues in order to prevent such complications.

        <tr id="In central nervous system (CNS) diseases characterized by late-onset neurodegeneration, the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in extensive health challenges globally. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, clinical studies have revealed that it could also affect multiple organs, including the heart, kidneys, liver, and brain, leading to severe complications. To unravel the intricate molecular interactions between the virus and host tissues, we performed an integrated transcriptomic analysis to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on various organs, with a particular focus on the relationship between renal failure and COVID-19. A comparative analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 triggers a systemic immune response in the brain, heart, and kidney tissues, characterized by significant upregulation of cytokine and chemokine secretion, along with enhanced migration of lymphocytes and leukocytes. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 could also induce tissue-specific transcriptional profiling. More importantly, single-cell sequencing revealed that COVID-19 patients with renal failure exhibited lower metabolic activity in lung epithelial and B cells, with reduced ligand–receptor interactions, especially CD226 and ICAM, suggesting a compromised immune response. A trajectory analysis revealed that COVID-19 patients with renal failure exhibited less mature alveolar type 1 cells. Furthermore, these patients showed potential fibrosis in the hearts, liver, and lung increased extracellular matrix remodeling activities. However, there was no significant metabolic dysregulation in the liver of COVID-19 patients with renal failure. Candidate drugs prediction by Drug Signatures database and LINCS L1000 Antibody Perturbations Database underscored the importance of considering multi-organ effects in COVID-19 management and highlight potential therapeutic strategies, including targeting viral entry and replication, controlling tissue fibrosis, and alleviating inflammation.">

Many pneumonia outbreaks have occurred in local areas and even in the world. Since the end of 2019, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has once again attracted the world's attention to viral pneumonia. At present, a large number of basic research, drug development and clinical trials are being carried out for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. However, patients are generally given symptomatic and supportive treatment, antiviral therapy, immunotherapy, glucocorticoid therapy and respiratory support. Therefore, finding new and effective treatment methods based on the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still the current practical demand and research focus. This review focuses on the occurrence and development of CS and the immunopathological damage caused by CS in viral pneumonia, especially in severe pneumonia, and summarizes the potential means of treating CS through IL-related pathways. Research found that different viruses cause CS, cytokines involved in the type and severity of differences, therefore, should also be targeted in the treatment strategy. In addition, in addition to focusing on the treatment of CS, in order to better study the pathophysiological mechanism of virus-induced CS and screen intervention drugs efficiently, how to safely and effectively establish cell and animal models of CS and improve the scientific evaluation system are also key issues worthy of attention.">

Here, we incorporated peripheral human monocyte-derived macrophages within a microfluidic human Lung Alveolus Chip that recreates the human alveolar-capillary interface under an air-liquid interface along with vascular flow to study how residential AMs contribute to the human pulmonary response to viral infection. When Lung Alveolus Chips that were cultured with macrophages were infected with influenza H3N2, there was a major reduction in viral titers compared to chips without macrophages; however, there was significantly greater inflammation and tissue injury. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, recruitment of immune cells circulating through the vascular channel, and expression of genes involved in myelocyte activation were all increased, and this was accompanied by reduced epithelial and endothelial cell viability and compromise of the alveolar tissue barrier. These effects were partially mediated through activation of pyroptosis in macrophages and release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, and blocking pyroptosis via caspase-1 inhibition suppressed lung inflammation and injury on-chip. These findings demonstrate how integrating tissue resident immune cells within human Lung Alveolus Chip can identify potential new therapeutic targets and uncover cell and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).">

        <tr id="Aging is physiologically associated with a decline in the function of the immune system and subsequent susceptibility to infections. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key element in the activation of cellular immunity, plays an important role in defense against virus infections. Decreased levels of IFN-γ in the elderly may explain their increased risk for viral infectious diseases such as COVID-19. There is accumulating evidence that ascorbic acid (vitamin C [VitC]) and α-tocopherol together help improve the function of the immune system in the elderly, control infections, and decrease the treatment duration. A SARS-CoV-2 strain was isolated from a patient and then cultured in the Vero cell line. The isolated and propagated virus was then inactivated using formalin and purified by the column chromatography. The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was formulated in the Alum adjuvant combined with VitC or α-tocopherol and/or both of them. The vaccines were injected twice to young and aged C57BL/6 mice. Two weeks later, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-2 cytokines were assessed using ELISA Kits. Specific IgG and IgG1/IgG2a were assessed by an in-house ELISA. In addition, the expression of PD1 and TERT genes in the spleen tissue of the mice was measured using real-time PCR. IL-4 and IFN-γ cytokines showed a significant increase in both aged and young mice compared with the Alum-based vaccine. In addition, our results exhibited a significant decrease and increase in specific total IgG and the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, respectively. Furthermore, the vaccine formulated in α-tocopherol + VitC led to decreased PD1 and increased TERT gene expression levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that α-tocopherol + VitC formulated in the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine led to a shift toward Th1, which may be due to their effect on the physiology of cells, especially aged ones and changing their phenotype toward young cells.">

        <tr id="Rhinovirus C (RV-C) infects airway epithelial cells and is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in humans. To interrogate the mechanisms of RV-C-mediated disease, animal models are essential. Towards this, RV-C infection was recently reported in wild-type (WT) mice, yet, titers were not sustained. Therefore, the requirements for RV-C infection in mice remain unclear. Notably, prior work has implicated human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as essential host factors for virus uptake and replication, respectively. Here, we report that even though human (h) and murine (m) CDHR3 orthologs have similar tissue distribution, amino acid sequence homology is limited. Further, while RV-C can replicate in mouse lung epithelial type 1 (LET1) cells and produce infectious virus, we observed a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of dsRNA-positive cells following hSTING expression. Based on these findings, we sought to assess the impact of hCDHR3 and hSTING on RV-C infection in mice in vivo. Thus, we developed hCDHR3 transgenic mice, and utilized adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver hSTING to the murine airways. Subsequent challenge of these mice with RV-C15 revealed significantly higher titers 24 h post-infection in mice expressing both hCDHR3 and hSTING—compared to either WT mice, or mice with hCDHR3 or hSTING alone, indicating more efficient infection. Ultimately, this mouse model can be further engineered to establish a robust in vivo model, recapitulating viral dynamics and disease.">

        <tr id="The identification of specific markers for microglia has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, markers such as P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls have been proposed as microglia-specific and widely used to explore microglial functions within various central nervous system (CNS) contexts. The specificity of these markers was based on the assumption that circulating monocytes retain their distinct signatures even after infiltrating the CNS. However, recent findings reveal that infiltrating monocytes can adopt microglia-like characteristics while maintaining a pro-inflammatory profile upon permanent engraftment in the CNS.In this study, we utilize bone marrow chimeras, single-cell RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that engrafted monocytes acquire expression of established microglia markers—P2ry12, TMEM119, Fcrls—and the pan-myeloid marker Iba1, which has been commonly mischaracterized as microglia-specific. These changes are accompanied by alterations in chromatin accessibility and shifts in chromatin binding motifs that are indicative of microglial identity. Moreover, we show that engrafted monocytes dynamically regulate the expression of CX3CR1, CCR2, Ly6C, and transcription factors PU.1, CTCF, RUNX, AP-1, CEBP, and IRF2, all of which are crucial for shaping microglial identity. This study is the first to illustrate that engrafted monocytes in the retina undergo both epigenetic and transcriptional changes, enabling them to express microglia-like signatures. These findings highlight the need for future research to account for these changes when assessing the roles of monocytes and microglia in CNS pathology. Significance Statement Monocytes can express putative microglia markers P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls upon engraftment into the retina. Given their involvement in neuroinflammation, it is crucial to consider this overlap when utilizing these markers for experimental analysis.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by chronic inflammation and damage to the central nervous system, and substantial characterization of molecular signatures of glial and immune cells in the disease has been conducted. However, comparatively less well characterized is the molecular signature of pathologically inflamed neurons. Here, we accessed multi-omic high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic data to investigate the molecular signature of neurons from progressive MS patients and from mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results indicate a shared and consistent neuronal gene expression signature in MS and EAE samples including a notable upregulation of immune system related genes and processes. Analysis of immune-enriched pathways in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and motor neurons from mice subjected to EAE revealed enrichment for the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway and interferon response genes in both types of neurons, and ATAC-seq analysis confirmed the accessibility of these genes. Parallel analyses of neurons from MS patients identified a signature of 48 commonly upregulated immune genes in neurons. Prediction of transcriptional regulators of these genes identified key upstream regulators including signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon response factor 5 (IRF5), highly involved in immune-related processes, with significant gene expression changes in both RGCs and motor neurons. Protein-protein interaction analyses among the transcriptional regulators unveiled intricate interactions among transcription factors, especially from the IRF and STAT families, suggesting their importance in regulating immune gene expression in inflamed neurons. Small molecule inhibition of IRF5 in inflamed neurons in vitro promoted cell survival and reduced the expression of the immune gene signature, supporting the biological relevance of IRF5 in mediating the neuronal inflammatory response. Together, this study identifies regulated immune processes in neurons from EAE mice and from MS patient samples suggesting potential roles for neuronal immune molecules in disease progression, as revealed by transcriptomic, epigenomic, and experimental approaches. Further, the results strongly implicate active interferon signaling in neurons driving immune related changes in gene expression through IRF5 and STAT1 transcription factor activity, potentially impacting downstream neuronal survival through IRF5 activity.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Increasing evidence suggests that Fc‐mediated antibody effector functions have an important role in protection against respiratory viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. However, limited data are available on the potential differences in the development, heterogeneity and durability of these responses in children compared to adults. Methods Here, we assessed the development of spike S1‐specific serum antibody‐dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement deposition (ADCD) and natural killer cell activation (ADNKA), alongside specific antibody binding concentrations (IgG, IgA and IgM) and IgG avidity in healthy adults (n = 38, 18–56 years) and children (n = 21, 5–16 years) following primary SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, with a 10‐month longitudinal follow‐up. Differences between groups were assessed using a nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons test. Results We found similar (functional) antibody responses in children compared to adults, with a tendency for increased durability in children, which was statistically significant for ADCD (P < 0.05). While ADNKA was strongly reduced in both adults (P < 0.001) and children (P < 0.05) at the latest time point, ADCP remained relatively stable over time, possibly relating to an increase in avidity of the spike‐specific antibodies (P < 0.001). Finally, the ADNKA capacity relative to antibody concentration appeared to decrease over time in both children and adults. Conclusion In conclusion, our data provide novel insights into the development of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibody Fc‐mediated effector functions in children and adults. An increased understanding of these characteristics in specific age populations is valuable for the future design of novel and improved vaccination strategies for respiratory viruses such as SARS‐CoV‐2.">

        <tr id="With circulation of SARS-CoV-2, fears about coinfection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV were significant, but the opposite was observed. Distancing/barriers played a major role in reducing other viral co-infections, however, some infrequent co-infections still occurred. We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RSV during coinfection to understand how they might compete or synergize. We found only RSV’s replication was significantly reduced when coinfected with SARS-CoV-2. Investigation of the mechanism revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp1 disrupts the RSV M2-2 protein but not the upstream M2-1 protein on the same biscistronic mRNA transcript. The impact of Nsp1 on M2-2 was not dependent on M2-2 being the second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA transcript, but likely from prevention of ribosomal termination-reinitiation necessary for M2-2 production. Additional viral ORFs from influenza A, influenza B, or Sendai virus dependent on the same or other ribosomal initiation mechanisms were tested and we found only influenza B M/M2 which likely uses a similar method as M2-2 was disrupted. Various M2-2 constructs, with/without the proposed site of ribosomal termination-reinitiating, co-transfected with Nsp1 and were in agreement that disruption to M2-2 expression occurs if the site of re-initiation was present upstream. These data not only suggest Sars-CoV-2 can outcompete RSV through suppression of M2, but may also point to potential ways to interfere with RSV by targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, particularly causes severe inflammatory disease in elderly, obese, and male patients. Since both aging and obesity are associated with decreased testosterone and estradiol expression, we hypothesized that decreased hormone levels contribute to excessive inflammation in the context of COVID-19. Previously, we and others have shown that hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 patients is induced by the production of pathogenic anti-spike IgG antibodies that activate alveolar macrophages. Therefore, we developed an in vitro assay in which we stimulated human macrophages with viral stimuli, anti-spike IgG immune complexes, and different sex hormones. Treatment with levels of testosterone reflecting young adults led to a significant reduction in TNF and IFN-γ production by human macrophages. In addition, estradiol significantly attenuated the production of a very broad panel of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ. Both testosterone and estradiol reduced the expression of Fc gamma receptors IIa and III, the two main receptors responsible for anti-spike IgG-induced inflammation. Combined, these findings indicate that sex hormones reduce the inflammatory response of human alveolar macrophages to specific COVID-19-associated stimuli, thereby providing a potential immunological mechanism for the development of severe COVID-19 in both older male and female patients.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Microbiome perturbations can have long-term effects on health. The dynamics of the gut microbiome and virome in women living with HIV (WLHIV) and their newborn infants is poorly understood. Here, we performed metagenomic sequencing analyses on longitudinal stool samples including 23 mothers (13 WLHIV, 10 HIV-negative) and 12 infants that experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild disease, as well as 40 mothers (18 WLHIV, 22 HIV-negative) and 60 infants that remained SARS-CoV-2 seronegative throughout the study follow-up. Regardless of HIV or SARS-CoV-2 status, maternal bacterial and viral profiles were distinct from infants. Using linear mixed effects models, we showed that the microbiome alpha diversity trajectory was not significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and seronegative women. However, seropositive women’s positive trajectory while uninfected was abruptly reversed after SARS-CoV-2 infection (p = 0.015). Gut virome signatures of women were not associated with SARS-CoV-2. Alterations in infant microbiome and virome diversities were generally not impacted by SARS-CoV-2 but were rather driven by development. We did not find statistically significant interactions between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 on the gut microbiome and virome. Overall, our study provides insights into the complex interplay between maternal and infant bacterial microbiome, virome, and the influence of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV status.">

How Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the influence of HIV-1 on pathogenesis remains unclear. Using human pericytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia alone; and combined in an in vitro BBB we investigated Mtb +/− HIV-1 co-infection on central nervous system cell entry and function. Mtb infected and multiplied in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. The permeability of the BBB increased resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects included increased markers of cellular stress, ROS release, the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes, and increased secretion of neuroexcitotoxic glutamate. Distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators were observed. These data indicate Mtb can translocate the BBB directly to initiate meningitis.">

        <tr id="The infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with neurotropic viruses induces neuroinflammation and an immune response, which is associated with the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, involving microglia, macrophages, and T and B cells, while required for efficient viral control within the CNS, is also associated with neuropathology. Under pathological events, such as CNS viral infection, microglia/macrophage undergo a reactive response, leading to the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery into the brain, disrupting CNS homeostasis and contributing to the pathogenesis of disease. The Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelination disease (TMEV-IDD), which serves as a mouse model of MS. This murine model made significant contributions to our understanding of the pathophysiology of MS following subsequent to infection. Microglia/macrophages could be activated into two different states, classic activated state (M1 state) and alternative activated state (M2 state) during TMEV infection. M1 possesses the capacity to initiate inflammatory response and secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M2-liked microglia/macrophages are anti-inflammatory characterized by the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This review aims to discuss the roles of microglia/macrophages M1/M2-liked polarization during TMEV infection, and explore the potential therapeutic effect of balancing M1/M2-liked polarization of microglia/macrophages on MS.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Microglia, essential immune cells in the brain, play crucial roles in neuroinflammation by performing various functions such as neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, and pathogen defense. These cells are activated by inflammatory factors like β-amyloid (Aβ) and oxysterols, leading to morphological and functional changes, including the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and the upregulation of MHC class II molecules. This study focused on identifying specific markers for microglial activation, with a particular emphasis on the roles of oxysterols in this process. We used the HMC3 human microglial cell line to investigate the induction of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), a chaperonin protein by oxysterols, specifically in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHChol) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHChol). Our findings obtained by the proteomics approach revealed that these oxysterols significantly increased HSP60 expression on microglial cells. This induction was further confirmed using Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. Additionally, Aβ1–42 also promoted HSP60 expression, indicating its role as a microglial activator. HSP60 involved in protein folding and immune modulation was identified as a potential marker for microglial activation. This study underscores the importance of HSP60 in the inflammatory response of microglia, suggesting its utility as a target for new therapeutic approaches in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD).">

        <tr id="Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is one of the most prevalent respiratory pathogens in horses with a high impact on animal health worldwide. Entry of the virus into epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and rapid local viral replication is followed by infection of local lymphoid tissues leading to cell-associated viremia and disease progression. Pre-existing mucosal immunity has previously been shown to reduce viral shedding and prevent viremia, consequently limiting severe disease manifestations. Here, nasopharyngeal transcriptomic profiling was used to identify differentially expressed genes following EHV-1 challenge in horses with different EHV-1 immune statuses. Immune horses (n = 4) did neither develop clinical disease nor viremia and did not shed virus after experimental infection, while non-immune horses (n = 4) did all the above. RNA sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal samples pre- and 24 hours post-infection (24hpi). At 24hpi, 109 and 44 genes were upregulated in immune horses and non-immune horses, respectively, and three genes were explored in further detail. Antileukoproteinase (SLPI) gene expression increased 2.1-fold within 24 hours in immune horses in concert with protein secretion. Interferon (IFN)-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) and 3 (IFIT3) were upregulated in non-immune horses, corresponding with nasal IFN-α secretion and viral replication. By contrast, neither IFIT expression nor IFN-α secretion was induced by EHV-1 infection of immune horses. Transcriptomic profiling offered a tool to identify, for the first time, the role of SLPI in innate immunity against EHV-1, and further emphasized the central role of the type I IFN response in the anti-viral defense of non-immune horses.


IMPORTANCE
Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) remains a considerable concern in the equine industry, with yearly outbreaks resulting in morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. In addition to its importance in equine health, EHV-1 is a respiratory pathogen and an alphaherpesvirus, and it may serve as a model for other viruses with similar pathogenicity or phylogeny. Large animal models allow the collection of high-volume samples longitudinally, permitting in-depth investigation of immunological processes. This study was performed on bio-banked nasopharyngeal samples from an EHV-1 infection experiment, where clinical outcomes had previously been determined. Matched nucleic acid and protein samples throughout infection permitted longitudinal quantification of the protein or related proteins of selected differentially expressed genes detected during the transcriptomic screen. The results of this manuscript identified novel innate immune pathways of the upper respiratory tract during the first 24 hours of EHV-1 infection, offering a first look at the components of early mucosal immunity that are indicative of protection.">

        <tr id="Objective Single-cell technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the phenotypic and transcriptional diversity of aortic leukocytes in atherosclerotic humans and mice. However, enzymatically dissociated tissues lose the spatial context of plaque cells in situ. Here we utilized imaging mass cytometry (IMC) combining with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the spatial distribution dynamics, phenotypic transitions, metabolic and functional phenotypes, and the intercellular interaction networks of plaque cells during atherosclerotic progression. Additionally, the dynamic immune landscape of circulating leukocytes associated with atherosclerosis was characterized using cytometry of time of flight (CyTOF). Approach and Results A highly multiplexed IMC panel with 33 metal-conjugated antibodies was designed to generate 11 highly multiplexed histology images of aortic root tissues from ApoE-/- mice on high-fat diet at different stage of atherosclerosis. Using histoCAT, we identified 8 principal cell subtypes with distinct phenotypic and geographic dynamics. Furthermore, IMC-defined cell subsets partially corresponded to scRNA-seq-annotated aortic cell subtypes, including 4 macrophage subsets, neutrophils, smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and SMC-derived SEMs (Stem cell, endothelial cell and macrophage-like cell). Activation of inflammatory pathways, increased oxidative phosphorylation and augmented osteoclast differentiation were observed in macrophage populations, SMCs and SEMs from an early stage to advanced stage of atherosclerosis. Notably, cell neighborhood analysis by IMC uncovered multifaceted cell-cell interactions within the plaque, in particular in neutrophil-mediated interactions with smooth muscle cells and macrophages, which were confirmed by ligand-receptor interactions based on scRNA-seq data. Additionally, characterization of the peripheral immune cells by CyTOF revealed an increased ratio of myeloid cells to lymphocytes, and certain neutrophil and monocyte subpopulations also exhibited enhanced lipid metabolism and glycolysis as well as activated inflammatory signaling. Conclusion This study provides a dynamic spatiotemporal landscape of atherosclerotic lesions and peripheral leukocytes. The new information based on IMC may help understand atherosclerotic pathology and develop novel therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains an international health problem caused by the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of May 2024, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths globally. Despite current vaccination programs, infections are still rapidly increasing, mainly due to the appearance and spread of new variants, variations in immunization rates, and limitations of current vaccines in preventing transmission. This underscores the need for pan-variant antivirals and treatments. The interferon (IFN) system is a critical element of the innate immune response and serves as a frontline defense against viruses. It induces a generalized antiviral state by transiently upregulating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To gain a deeper comprehension of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, its connection to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and the potential therapeutic implications, this review provides a detailed overview of fundamental aspects of the diverse ISGs identified for their antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. It emphasizes the importance of these proteins in controlling viral replication and spread. Furthermore, we explore methodological approaches for the identification of ISGs and conduct a comparative analysis with other viruses. Deciphering the roles of ISGs and their interactions with viral pathogens can help identify novel targets for antiviral therapies and enhance our preparedness to confront current and future viral threats.">

        <tr id="        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2). It is characterized by respiratory distress, multiorgan dysfunction and death in some cases. The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestation. However the pathological mechanism underling the disease has not been fully defined. Lung autopsy samples from 3 patients with fatal COVID-19 were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin stain to analyze the histopathological changes. While immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed for detecting CD4 in helper T-cells, CD8 in cytotoxic T-cells, CD56 in NK-cells and CD45RO in memory T-cells. Histopathological examination revealed features of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with exudate in alveolar space and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Immunohistochemistry staining for CD4 showed weak to positive staining, CD8 showed weak positive staining, CD56 showed negative staining, while CD45RO showed a positive staining. It can be concluded that SARS-CoV-2 virus impaired innate immune response through a decrease in NK cells and adaptive immune response through a decrease in CD8 T cells which is one of the explanations of the destructive nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus.">

        <tr id="The enduring impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its disease manifestation, COVID-19, on public health remains significant. Postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) affect a considerable number of patients, impairing their quality of life. While the role of the cytokine storm in acute COVID-19 is well established, its contribution to the pathophysiology of PASC is not fully understood. This study aimed to analyze the cytokine profile of patients with PASC following in vitro stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, comparing them with a healthy control group. From October 2020 till March 2021, Brugmann University Hospital's clinical research unit included patients with PASC in the study. Whole blood samples were collected from 50 patients and 25 healthy volunteers. After in vitro stimulation under five different conditions, cytokine levels were measured using a multiplex method. Significantly decreased cytokine levels were observed in patients with PASC compared with healthy volunteers, particularly after TLR4 (interleukin [IL]-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-10, interferon (IFN)α, IFNγ, IFNω, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α) and TLR7/8 (IL-1α, IL-1β, IFNα, IFNω, IFNγ, and TNFα) pathway stimulation. Principal component analysis identified two distinct clusters, suggesting a likely dysregulation of immunity involving TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways in patients with PASC. Our study suggests that TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways play a role in the pathophysiology of PASC. Continuous basal activation of immunity could explain the high basal concentrations of cytokines described in these patients and the decreased amplitude of response of these signaling pathways following specific stimulation.">

AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of trained immunity by reprogramming hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow generating trained innate cells with enhanced responsiveness. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung via neutrophils and IFNγ signalling, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (LPS) or viral (polyI:C) challenges.

        <tr id="Introduction Influenza virus infections are a major global health problem. Influenza can result in mild/moderate disease or progress to more severe disease, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Severity is thought to be primarily driven by immunopathology, but predicting which individuals are at a higher risk of being hospitalized warrants investigation into host genetics and the molecular signatures of the host response during influenza infections. Methods Here, we performed transcriptome and genotype analysis in healthy controls and patients exhibiting mild/moderate or severe influenza (ICU patients). A unique aspect of our study was the genotyping of all participants, which allowed us to assign ethnicities based on genetic variation and assess whether the variation was correlated with expression levels. Results We identified 169 differentially expressed genes and related molecular pathways between patients in the ICU and those who were not in the ICU. The transcriptome/genotype association analysis identified 871 genes associated to a genetic variant and 39 genes distinct between African-Americans and Caucasians. We also investigated the effects of age and sex and found only a few discernible gene effects in our cohort. Discussion Together, our results highlight select risk factors that may contribute to an increased risk of ICU admission for influenza-infected patients. This should help to develop better diagnostic tools based on molecular signatures, in addition to a better understanding of the biological processes in the host response to influenza.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a key role in exacerbating dopaminergic neuron (DAN) loss in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, it remains unresolved how to effectively normalize this immune response given the complex interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses occurring within a scarcely accessible organ like the brain. In this study, we uncovered a consistent correlation between neuroinflammation, brain parenchymal lymphocytes, and DAN loss among several commonly used mouse models of PD generated by a variety of pathological triggers. We validated a viral therapeutic approach for the microglia-specific expression of interleukin 10 (IL-10) to selectively mitigate the excessive inflammatory response. We found that this approach induced a local nigral IL-10 release that alleviated DAN loss in mice overexpressing the human SNCA gene in the substantia nigra. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that IL-10 induced the emergence of a molecularly distinct microglial cell state, enriched in markers of cell activation with enhanced expression of prophagocytic pathways. IL-10 promoted microglial phagocytotic and clearance activities in vitro and reduced αSYN aggregate burden in the nigral area in mice overexpressing SNCA. Furthermore, IL-10 stimulated the differentiation of CD4+ T lymphocytes into active T regulatory cells and promoted inhibitory characteristics in CD8+ T cells. In summary, our results show that local and microglia-specific IL-10 transduction elicited strong immunomodulation in the nigral tissue with enhanced suppression of lymphocyte toxicity that was associated with DAN survival. These results offer insights into the therapeutic benefits of IL-10 and showcase a promising gene delivery approach that could minimize undesired side effects. Microglia-specific IL-10 gene delivery protects from neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease mice by reshaping immune response and microglial state. Editor’s summary Reactive microglia contribute to Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis. Certain cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) can restore microglia homeostasis, but targeting maladaptive immune responses without inducing systemic side effects remains a challenge. Bido et al. adopted a microRNA-detargeting system that inhibits the expression of a transgene in all but the cell type of choice. Using this system for lentiviral-mediated, local, and microglia-specific expression of IL-10 in PD mice led to reduced neuropathology and the emergence of microglial subtypes with enhanced clearance signatures. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of cell type–specific gene delivery for PD. —Daniela Neuhofer">

        <tr id="Mosquito borne flaviviruses, including dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, have caused global epidemics in areas with high HIV prevalence due to the expanded geographic range of arthropod vectors. Despite the occurrence of large flavivirus outbreaks in countries with high HIV prevalence, there is little knowledge regarding the effects of flavivirus infection in people living with HIV (PLWH). Here, we use a pigtail macaque model of HIV/AIDS to investigate the impact of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-induced immunosuppression on ZIKV replication and pathogenesis. Early acute SIV infection induced expansion of peripheral ZIKV cellular targets and increased innate immune activation and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SIV infected macaques were less permissive to ZIKV infection in vitro. In SIV-ZIKV co-infected animals, we found increased persistence of ZIKV in the periphery and tissues corresponding to alterations in innate cellular (monocytes, neutrophils) recruitment to the blood and tissues, decreased anti-ZIKV immunity, and chronic peripheral inflammatory and innate immune gene expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that untreated SIV infection may impair cellular innate responses and create an environment of chronic immune activation that promotes prolonged ZIKV viremia and persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. These results suggest that PLWH or other immunocompromised individuals could be at a higher risk for chronic ZIKV replication, which in turn could increase the timeframe of ZIKV transmission. Thus, PLWH are important populations to target during the deployment of vaccine and treatment strategies against ZIKV. Author Summary Flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), cause global epidemics in areas with high HIV prevalence. Yet questions remain as to whether ZIKV disease is altered during an immunocompromised state and the potential immune mechanisms contributing to enhanced disease. This is essential to our understanding of ZIKV disease in people living with HIV (PLWH). Here, we use a non-human primate (NHP) model of HIV/AIDS to investigate the impact of immune suppression on ZIKV replication and pathogenesis. The use of the NHP model was critical for the assessment of longitudinal specimens across tissues that are active sites of flavivirus replication and host immune responses. This study broadly demonstrates that ZIKV pathogenesis is altered and more persistent in states of immunosuppression. Collectively, this study suggests that in PLWH and immunocompromised individuals, other arboviruses, including dengue and West Nile viruses, could similarly alter pathogenesis and/or viral peristance in tissues. Furthermore, this study highlights the need to prioritize immunocompromised individuals in the design and rollout of vaccines against arboviral diseases.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as one of the worst viral pandemics during the past few years. As reported by the World Health Organization, around 77,56 49 520 cases and 70 51 720 deaths were reported from all over the world, which includes approximately 3500 patients reported during the recent past only. Currently, circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 are KP.3, JN.1, BA.2.86 and KP.2. Mass vaccinations have been provided since the end of December 2020, which led to 5.47 billion people vaccinated till date. However, the disease continues in small foci all over the world. Development of an effective drug target and mutation independent vaccine thus becomes essential research priorities. Owing to the unavailability of a specific drug molecule, the present study has focused on the development of an effective drug target to treat COVID-19. In-house primers were designed for four essential structural genes viz., Spike protein, ORF1ab, Nucleocapsid gene, and Envelope gene. Samples of different waves were amplified using these primers employing the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. A total number of 86 SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR positive samples were studied, and results showed the most frequent appearance (80.2%) of Envelope (E) protein in all the samples. This suggests that during transmission across numbers of human hosts, it is the Envelope protein that was the most stable one. The most severe Delta variant showed the presence of E proteins in all the samples assayed. Blocking E protein as a new drug target to intervene intracellular replication of virus could be an effective drug development strategy.">

        <tr id="Secondary injury following spinal cord injury is primarily characterized by a complex inflammatory response, with resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages playing pivotal roles. While previous studies have grouped these two cell types together based on similarities in structure and function, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that microglia and macrophages exhibit differences in structure and function and have different effects on disease processes. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to identify the distinct evolutionary paths of microglia and macrophages following spinal cord injury. Our results showed that microglia were activated to a pro-inflammatory phenotype immediately after spinal cord injury, gradually transforming to an anti-inflammatory steady state phenotype as the disease progressed. Regarding macrophages, our findings highlighted abundant communication with other cells, including fibroblasts and neurons. Both pro-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of macrophages were also identified; the pro-inflammatory effect may be related to integrin β2 (Itgb2) and the neuroprotective effect may be related to the oncostatin M pathway. These findings were validated by in vivo experiments. This research underscores differences in the cellular dynamics of microglia and macrophages following spinal cord injury, and may offer new perspectives on inflammatory mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Long COVID (post-acute sequelae of COVID-19—PASC) is a consequence of infection by SARS-CoV-2 that continues to disrupt the well-being of millions of affected individuals for many months beyond their first infection. While the exact mechanisms underlying PASC remain to be defined, hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of long COVID are varied and include (but are not limited to) dysregulated local or systemic inflammatory responses, autoimmune mechanisms, viral-induced hormonal imbalances, skeletal muscle abnormalities, complement dysregulation, novel abzymes, and long-term persistence of virus and/or fragments of viral RNA or proteins. This review article is based on a comprehensive review of the wide range of symptoms most often observed in long COVID and an attempt to integrate that information into a plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of PASC. In particular, it is proposed that long-term dysregulation of the gut in response to viral persistence could lead to the myriad of symptoms observed in PASC.">

        <tr id="Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is one of the leading causes of mortality in patients with COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. However, the mechanism of CRS induced by SARS-CoV-2 is vague.Using spike protein combined with IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α to stimulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to secrete CRS-related cytokines, the content of cytokines in the supernatant was detected, and the effects of NK, T, and monocytes were analyzed.This study shows that dendritic cells loaded with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 stimulate T cells to release much more interleukin-2 (IL-2,) which subsequently cooperates with spike protein to facilitate PBMCs to release IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. These effects are achieved via IL-2 stimulation of NK cells to release tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), as well as T cells to release IFN-γ Mechanistically, IFN-γ and TNF-α enhance the transcription of CD40, and the interaction of CD40 and its ligand stabilizes the membrane expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that serves as a receptor of spike protein on the surface of monocytes. As a result, there is a constant interaction between spike protein and TLR4, leading to continuous activation of nuclear factor-κ-gene binding (NF-κB). Furthermore, TNF-α also activates NF-κB signaling in monocytes, which further cooperates with IFN-γ and spike protein to modulate NF-κB–dependent transcription of CRS-related inflammatory cytokines.Targeting TNF-α/IFN-γ in combination with TLR4 may represent a promising therapeutic approach for alleviating CRS in individuals with COVID-19.">

In a cohort of 103 COVID-19 patients, we studied the relationship between the NfL and peripheral inflammatory markers. We found that the NfL levels are significantly predicted by a panel of circulating cytokines/chemokines, including CRP, IL-4, IL-8, IL-9, Eotaxin, and MIP-1ß, which are highly up-regulated during COVID-19 and are associated with clinical outcomes. Our findings show that peripheral cytokines influence the plasma levels of the NfL, suggesting a potential role of the NfL as a marker of neuronal damage associated with COVID-19 inflammation.">

        <tr id="Immune profiling of Nipah virus (NiV) infection survivors is essential for advancing our understanding of NiV pathogenesis, improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and guiding public health efforts to prevent future outbreaks. There is currently limited data available on the immune response to NiV infection. We aimed to elucidate the specific immune mechanisms involved in protection against NiV infection by analyzing the immune profiles of survivors of the Nipah outbreak in Kerala, India 2023. Immune cell populations were quantified and compared between survivors (up to 4 months post onset day of illness) and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore associations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes. Immune signatures common to all three cases were: a heretofore undescribed persistent lymphopenia including the CD4+ Treg compartment with the relative expansion of memory Tregs; trends indicative of global leukopenic modulation were observed in monocytes and granulocytes including an expansion of putatively immunosuppressive low-density granulocytes described recently in the context of severe COVID-19; altered mucosal homing with respect to integrin beta-7 (ITGB7) expressing subsets; increased mobilization of activated T-cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and plasmablasts in the early phase of infection. Comparative analysis based on clinical presentation and outcome yielded lower initial viremia, increased activated T-cell responses, expanded plasmablasts, and restoration of ITGB7 expressing CD8+ T-cells as possible protective signatures. This longitudinal study delineates putative protective signatures associated with milder NiV disease. It emphasizes the need for the development of immunotherapeutic interventions such as monoclonal antibodies to blunt early viremia and ameliorate pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Viral infection of cells leads to metabolic changes, but how viral infection changes whole-body and tissue metabolism in vivo has not been comprehensively studied. In particular, it is unknown how metabolism might be differentially affected by an acute infection that the immune system can successfully clear, compared to a chronic and persistent infection. Here we used metabolomics and isotope tracing to identify metabolic changes in mice infected with acute or chronic forms of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) for three or eight days. Both types of infection alter metabolite levels in blood and tissues, including itaconate and thymidine. However, we observed more dramatic metabolite changes in the blood and tissues of mice with chronic LCMV infection compared to those with acute infection. Isotope tracing revealed that the contribution of both glucose and glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle increase in the spleen, liver, and kidneys of mice infected with chronic LCMV, while acute LCMV only increases the contribution of glutamine to the TCA cycle in the spleen. We found that whole-body turnover of both glutamine and thymidine increase during acute and chronic infection, whereas whole-body glucose turnover was surprisingly unchanged. Activated T cells in vitro produce thymidine and mice with T cell leukemia display elevated serum thymidine, nominating T lymphocytes as the source of thymidine in LCMV infection. In sum, we provide comprehensive measurements of whole-body and tissue metabolism in acute and chronic viral infection, and identify altered thymidine metabolism as a marker of viral infection.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is characterized by excessive inflammation leading to the development of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) derived from ω6 and ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are central to the regulation of inflammation, controlling both its initiation and resolution. Still, their role in COVID-19 remains underexplored. By employing a holistic approach involving the analysis of white blood cell transcriptomes, targeted lipidomics, cytokine and immune cell profiling, across the spectrum of disease severity groups, including mild non-hospitalized patients and healthy individuals, we now show that LM networks are profoundly altered in COVID-19, correlate with inflammatory patterns, and stratify patients according to disease severity. Central to this are CYP450-derived LMs such as 20-HETE, lipid peroxidation metabolites such as iPF2a-VI, and lipoxygenase-derived LMs such as 12-HETE, all of which are major vasoactive mediators of inflammation. Among them, 20-HETE appears to be a promising prognostic biomarker for ICU admission and a potential therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 disease. Our study thus underscores the significance of LM networks in COVID-19 pathophysiology and sheds light into the broader mechanisms driving viral pneumonia in humans.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses are a genus of small RNA viruses that are responsible for approximately one billion global infections annually. These infections range in severity from the common cold and flu-like symptoms to more severe diseases, such as viral myocarditis, pancreatitis, and neurological disorders, that continue to pose a global health challenge with limited therapeutic strategies currently available. In the current study, we sought to understand the interaction between coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which is a model enterovirus, and macrophage cells, as there is limited understanding of how this virus interacts with macrophage innate immune cells. Our study demonstrated that CVB3 can robustly activate macrophages without apparent viral replication in these cells. We also showed that myeloid cells lacked the viral entry receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, the expression of exogenous CAR in RAW264.7 macrophages was unable to overcome the viral replication deficit. Interestingly, the CAR expression was associated with altered inflammatory responses during prolonged infection. Additionally, we identified the autophagy protein LC3 as a novel stimulus for macrophage activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CVB3-induced macrophage activation and its implications for viral pathogenesis.">

We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (CVOID-19) has varied clinical manifestations including mild to severe acute respiratory symptoms. Inflammasome complex and mitochondria play an important role in initiating inflammatory responses and could potentially be affected by this infection. To study the inflammasome and mitochondrial fission and fusion gene expression levels in COVID-19 patients, we designed this experiment. 
The inflammasome and mitochondrial gene expression profiles were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the peripheral blood of 70 hospitalized CVOID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms (HOSP) and 30 ICU patients with severe symptoms (ICU) compared to 20 healthy controls (HC). 
The results indicated that the expression of the dynamin-related protein-1 was extremely suppressed in HOSP while it came back to the normal range in the ICU group. However, the expression of fission 1 protein had a non-significant increase in HOSP and a decrease in the ICU group. The mitofusin-1 and dominant optic atrophy genes showed high expression levels (10-fold) and (70-fold), respectively, in the HOSP group. However, mitofusin-2 significantly decreased in both groups. Although leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 (NLRP3) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activating and recruitment domain genes dramatically increased in both groups (10 and 4-fold), other inflammasome genes declined in both groups. Finally, Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activate d B cells (NF-κB) extremely decreased, and Intreleukine-1 showed high expression in ICU patients (3-fold). 
CVOID-19 infection suppresses the fission genes and elevates the fusion gene expression in mitochondria, and it can cause activation of the inflammasome via the NLRP3 pathway.">

        <tr id="Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the severity of COVID-19, since the respiratory, thrombotic and myocardial complications of the disease are closely linked to vascular endothelial damage. To address this issue, we evaluate here the effect of conditioned media from spike S1-activated macrophages (CM_S1) on the proliferation of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), focusing on the specific role of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Results obtained demonstrate that the incubation with CM_S1 for 72 h hinders endothelial cell proliferation and induces signs of cytotoxicity. Comparable results are obtained upon exposure to IFN-γ + TNF-α, which are thus postulated to play a pivotal role in the effects observed. These events are associated with an increase in p21 protein and a decrease in Rb phosphorylation, as well as with the activation of IRF-1 and NF-kB transcription factors. Overall, these findings further sustain the pivotal role of a hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines as a trigger for endothelial activation and injury in the immune-mediated effects of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Epithelial injury calls for a regenerative response from a coordinated network of epithelial stem cells and immune cells. Defining this network is key to preserving the repair process for acute resolution, but also for preventing a remodeling process with chronic dysfunction. We recently identified an immune niche for basal-epithelial stem cells using mouse models of injury after respiratory viral infection. Niche function depended on an early sentinel population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) that provided ligand GPNMB to basal-ESC receptor CD44 for reprogramming towards chronic lung disease. These same cell and molecular control points worked directly in mouse and human basal-ESC organoids, but the findings were not yet validated in vivo in human disease. Further, persistence of GPNMB expression in moDCs and M2-macrophages in mouse models suggested utility as a long-term disease biomarker in humans. Here we show increased expression of GPNMB localized to moDC-macrophage populations in lung tissue samples from long-term Covid, asthma, and COPD. The findings thereby provide initial evidence of a persistent and correctable pathway from acute injury to chronic disease with implications for cellular reprogramming and inflammatory memory.">

        <tr id="Diabetes significantly impacts the immune system; however, its role in worsening sepsis prognosis remains poorly understood. This study investigated the effect of hyperferritinemia on immune modulation in septic diabetic patients. A cohort study at Kyungpook National University Hospital stratified sepsis patients by diabetes status and followed them for 28 days. Additionally, CD4+ T cells from mice were analyzed for proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolic changes under ferritin treatment. Results from the clinical study showed higher ferritin levels in diabetic patients, and those with lower lymphocyte counts had increased mortality. In the mice study, ferritin inhibited T cell activation and proliferation by shifting metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation without increasing cell death. These findings suggest that the suppression of T cell proliferation due to elevated ferritin levels contributes to an immunosuppressive environment, leading to worse outcomes. In conclusion, hyperferritinemia is a biomarker for sepsis severity, particularly in diabetic patients, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies targeting ferritin levels or glycolytic pathways.">

        <tr id="Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are also associated with blood neutrophilia. The mechanistic relevance of this to symptoms or behavior is unclear. We used cytometry, immunohistochemistry, whole tissue clearing, and single-cell sequencing to characterize the meningeal immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice. We find that chronic, but not acute, stress causes meningeal neutrophil accumulation, and CSD increases neutrophil trafficking in vascular channels emanating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggested CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils. Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protected against the anhedonic and anxiogenic effects of CSD stress, potentially through reduced infiltration of IFNAR+ neutrophils into the meninges from skull BM. Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders. One sentence summary Type I interferon sensing neutrophils accumulate in meninges of psychosocially stressed mice via skull bone marrow channels and are associated with the negative behavioral sequelae of stress; blockade of this pathway inhibits neutrophil trafficking and improves behavioral outcomes.">

        <tr id="The increased incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, occurring in patients infected with severe influenza or SARS-CoV-2, suggests that antiviral immune responses create an environment permissive to fungal infection. Our recent evidence suggests that absence of the type I IFN receptor 2 subunit (IFNAR2) of the heterodimeric IFNAR1/2 receptor is allowing for this permissive immune environment of the lung through regulation of damage responses. Because damage is associated with poor outcome to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, this suggested that IFNAR2 may be involved in A. fumigatus susceptibility. In this study, we determined that absence of IFNAR2 resulted in increased inflammation, morbidity, and damage in the lungs in response to A. fumigatus challenge, whereas absence of IFNAR1 did not. Although the Ifnar2-/- mice had increased morbidity, we found that the Ifnar2-/- mice cleared more conidia compared with both wild-type and Ifnar1-/- mice. However, this early clearance did not prevent invasive disease from developing in the Ifnar2-/- mice as infection progressed. Importantly, by altering the inflamed environment of the Ifnar2-/- mice early during A. fumigatus infection, by neutralizing TNF-α, we were able to reduce the morbidity and fungal clearance in these mice back to wild-type levels. Together, our results establish a distinct role for IFNAR2 in regulating host damage responses to A. fumigatus and contributing to an A. fumigatus-permissive environment through regulation of inflammation. Specifically, our data reveal a role for IFNAR2 in regulating TNF-α-mediated damage and morbidity during A. fumigatus infection.">

        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The dynamics of the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) breakthrough infections remain unclear, particularly when compared to responses in naive individuals. In this longitudinal prospective cohort study, 13 participants were recruited. Peripheral blood samples were collected every other day until day 7 after symptom onset. Transcriptome sequencing, single-cell sequencing, T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing, Olink proteomics, and antigen-antibody binding experiments were then performed. During the incubation periods of breakthrough infections, peripheral blood exhibited type 2 cytokine response, which shifted to type 1 cytokine response upon symptom onset. Plasma cytokine levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 show larger changes in breakthrough infections than naïve infections. The inflammatory response in breakthrough infections rapidly subsided, returning to homeostasis by day 5 after symptom onset. Notably, the levels of monocyte-derived S100A8/A9, previously considered a marker of severe disease, physiologically significantly increased in the early stages of mild cases and persisted until day 7, suggesting a specific biological function. Longitudinal tracking also revealed that antibodies anti-Receptor Binding Domain (anti-RBD) in breakthrough infections significantly increased by day 7 after symptom onset, whereas cytotoxic T lymphocytes appeared by day 5. This study presents a reference for interpreting the immunological response to breakthrough infectious disease in humans.">

        <tr id="Bats can host viruses of pandemic concern without developing disease. The mechanisms underlying their exceptional resilience to viral infections are largely unresolved, necessitating the development of physiologically relevant and genetically tractable research models. Here, we developed respiratory and intestinal organoids that recapitulated the cellular diversity of the in vivo epithelium present in Rousettus aegyptiacus, the natural reservoir for the highly pathogenic Marburg virus (MARV). In contrast to human counterparts, bat organoids and mucosal tissue exhibited elevated constitutive expression of innate immune effectors, including type I interferon-ε (IFNε) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Upon infection with diverse zoonotic viruses, including MARV, bat organoids strongly induced type I and III IFN responses, which conferred robust antiviral protection. Type III IFNλ3 additionally displayed virus-independent self-amplification, acting as an ISG to enhance antiviral immunity. Our organoid platform reveals key features of bat epithelial antiviral immunity that may inform therapeutic strategies for viral disease resilience.">

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is a heterogeneous clinical condition of uncertain etiology triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we used ultrasensitive approaches to profile the immune system and the plasma proteome in healthy convalescent individuals and individuals with long COVID, spanning geographically independent cohorts from Sweden and the United Kingdom. Symptomatic disease was not consistently associated with quantitative differences in immune cell lineage composition or antiviral T cell immunity. Healthy convalescent individuals nonetheless exhibited higher titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 than individuals with long COVID, and extensive phenotypic analyses revealed a subtle increase in the expression of some co-inhibitory receptors, most notably PD-1 and TIM-3, among SARS-CoV-2 nonspike-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with long COVID. We further identified a shared plasma biomarker signature of disease linking breathlessness with apoptotic inflammatory networks centered on various proteins, including CCL3, CD40, IKBKG, IL-18 and IRAK1, and dysregulated pathways associated with cell cycle progression, lung injury and platelet activation, which could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of long COVID.">

        <tr id="Background CNS infection by HIV-1 contributes to neuroinflammation, cognitive impairments, and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Although HIV-1 is known to enter the brain early in infection via “Trojan horse” leukocytes, including infected monocytes and CD4+T cells, the specific cellular phenotypes facilitating this process during acute infection remain incompletely characterized. Objective This study aims to characterize the roles of brain lymphocytes during acute infection and primary CD4+ T cell phenotypes seeding the SIV to the CNS. Methods scRNA-seq was performed on brain and blood cells of three acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The transcriptomic data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches and validated through in vitro co-culture assays and re-analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset. Results We found a distinct cell cluster in the brain co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, suggesting brain myeloid cells may engulf CD4+ T cells entering from the blood. This finding was confirmed in by coculture studies of macrophages and T cells, and identified specific chemokines could distinguish such cells. Acute infection induced an increase in proliferating CD4+ cytotoxic-like T cells, which had high expression of viral entry receptors and adhesion molecules, indicating their role in CNS infection. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of cytotoxic genes, MHC class II molecules, ISG15, and USP18 in brain lymphocytes, indicating a robust immune response to acute infection. Conclusion Our findings suggest that CD4+cytotoxic-like T cells represent a key lymphocyte subset responsible for initiating SIV entry into the brain and triggering neuroinflammatory processes. Furthermore, interactions between infiltrating lymphocytes and brain-resident myeloid cells may facilitate viral propagation within the CNS.">

A deep-immunophenotyping of monocytes, T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) was performed, along with immunostainings of SARS-CoV-2 in the colon. Results Higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurofilaments were found in EVs but not in plasma from COVID-19 survivors. Additionally, COVID-19 participants exhibited altered monocyte activation markers and elevated cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Increased activation markers in CD4+ T-cells and decreased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in DCs were observed in COVID-19 participants. Furthermore, the amount of plasmacytoid DCs expressing β7-integrin were higher in COVID-19, potentially associated with the viral persistence observed in the colon. Conclusions COVID-19 survivors exhibit long-term immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring of PASC. The cargo of EVs can be a promising tool for early detection of virus-induced neurological disorders.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a significant risk to immunocompromised patients, who display weakened immunity and reduced seroconversion following infection and vaccination. In this study, we recruited 19 hospitalized patients with immune disorders (ImCo) and 4 immunocompetent controls (ICC) with COVID-19. We evaluated their serological, humoral, and cellular immune responses at <30 days and >90 days post-symptom onset. ICC patients showed robust B and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, indicated by detectable antibody levels, memory antibody-secreting cells (mASCs) towards the spike protein and spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. ImCo patients showed impaired immune responses, with lower levels of B cell responses. Further subdivision of the ImCo patients demonstrates that solid organ transplant (SOT) patients generated B cell responses similar to ICC patients, whereas the other ImCo patients, including patients with hematological malignancies and anti-CD20 therapy, did not. Absolute T cell numbers and spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were low in the ImCo patients at <30 days but increased at later time points. Our findings suggest that even when B cell responses were reduced, patients could present a T cell response, suggesting a more successful line of passive immunization for immunocompromised individuals focusing on boosting T cell responses.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 was the causing agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and massive economic losses. Although there are already several vaccines licensed, as novel variants develop, understanding the immune response induced by vaccination and natural infection is key for the development of future vaccines. Methods: In this study, we have used flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing to assess the longitudinal CD8+ T-cell response against natural infection and vaccination in convalescent and vaccinated individuals, from early activation to immune memory establishment. Moreover, we have characterized the T-cell receptor clonality and diversity at different stages post-infection and post-vaccination. Results: We have found no significant differences in CD8+ T-cell activation during the first three weeks post-infection compared to the first three weeks after first vaccination. Conversely, natural infection resulted in sustained high levels of T-cell activation at four weeks post-infection, a point in which we observed a decline in T-cell activation post-vaccination despite boosting with a second vaccination shot. Moreover, additional vaccination did not result in enhanced T-cell activation. Of note, we have observed variations in the memory subset structure at every stage of disease and vaccination. Overall, both infection and immunization induced a highly diverse T-cell receptor repertoire, which was observed both between study groups and between patients inside a given group. Conclusions: These data contribute to expand our knowledge about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination and call for additional strategies to enhance T-cell responses by booster immunization.">

        <tr id="Viral encephalitis, resulting from neurotropic viral infections, leads to severe neurological impairment, inflammation, and exhibits high mortality rates with poor prognosis. Currently, there is a lack of effective targeted treatments for this disease, which poses a significant public health concern. SARM1 has been identified as the pivotal mediator of axonal degeneration and inflammation across various neuropathies, activated by an elevation in the NMN/NAD+ ratio. However, comprehensive in vivo investigations into the role of SARM1-mediated pathogenesis in viral encephalitis are still lacking. In this study, we established mouse models of viral encephalitis using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and rabies virus (RABV) as representative pathogens. Our findings demonstrate that neurotropic virus infections elicit robust axonal degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, and profound neuropathological damage in cortical neurons via the activation of SARM1. In mouse models of viral encephalitis, deletion or inhibition of SARM1 effectively preserved axonal morphology and maintained mitochondrial homeostasis, while also attenuating the infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes in the cortex. Consequently, these interventions ameliorated neuropathological damage and enhanced survival outcomes in mice. Our findings suggest that SARM1-mediated axonal degeneration and brain inflammation exacerbate the pathological progression of viral encephalitis. Therapies targeting SARM1 emerge as viable and promising strategies for protecting neuronal function in the context of neurotropic viral infections.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. ZF2001, a protein subunit vaccine targeting the RBD, was utilized to evaluate its impact on the immune system of COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to investigate peripheral cell profiles one year after three doses of ZF2001 vaccine using single cell mass spectrometry flow cytometry (CyTOF), a technique that allows detailed characterization of the immune response against SARS-COV-2 infection and further evaluation of ZF2001 mechanisms as a prophylactic against chronic disease and reducing mortality. Methods This study profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 16 vaccinated COVID-19 patients (Omicron 5.2) and 8 hDs using CyTOF with a 41-antibody panel. PBMCs isolated via Lymphoprep density gradient underwent metal-tagged antibody staining. Data analysis included FlowJo gating, Seurat/Harmony batch correction, PhenoGraph clustering (k=45), and t-SNE visualization. Statistical assessments employed Wilcoxon tests and Spearman correlation. Results Our findings revealed significant differences between infected and healthy individuals one year after three doses of ZF2001. Specifically, infected individuals exhibited: significant elevation of cytotoxic T cells expressing CD8 with a proliferation marker antigen-Kiel 67 (Ki67) and an adhesion molecule (CD138), expansion of B cells and reduction of monocytes expressing CD16, as well as depletion of CD4+ T cells and differentiation of T cells 1 year after the vaccine. These changes suggested that the vaccine was effectively modulating the immune response. Discussion Our results provided a detailed single-cell profile of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated patients, highlighting significant changes in immune cell kinetics indicative of an active innate and adaptive immune cell response.">

        <tr id="Immune responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) following influenza A virus (IAV) infection can influence disease severity, and subsequently inflammation and lung tissue damage in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). This study investigated the role of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a key pattern recognition receptor that senses viral RNA and triggers antiviral and proinflammatory signaling to activate immune responses, in specifically shaping URT and LRT immune responses to IAV infection. Wild type C57Bl/6 and TLR7 knockout (TLR7 KO) mice were infected with the H3N2 IAV strain Hk-X31, and key immune responses in the nasal tissue (URT) and lower airways and lung tissue (LRT) measured after acute infection. We found reduced body weight loss, and increased type II/III interferons and proinflammatory cytokines in the URT of TLR7 KO mice; while LRT inflammation was reduced. TLR7 was essential for activating immune responses in the LRT but played a more selective role in the URT, primarily influencing monocytes, pDCs and B cells. Our data suggest that TLR7 plays a critical role in the transition of inflammation from the URT to the LRT during IAV infection, making it a promising therapeutic target to modulate disease severity.

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections trigger immune and inflammatory responses that can be associated with excessive oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) depletion, and a cytokine storm that drives virus-induced cell/tissue damage and severe disease. Erdosteine is a thiol-based drug with proven mucolytic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties, but less is known about its antiviral effects. We performed in vitro studies to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of erdosteine in A549-hACE2 human lung epithelial cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and in Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells infected with influenza A virus (H1N1). The cells were treated with different concentrations of erdosteine or its active metabolite 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MET-1) before and after viral infection. The viral replication/load in the cell culture supernatants was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay and digital droplet PCR. The gene expression of innate immune response signaling pathways and oxidative stress was analyzed by reverse transcription PCR custom-array. The results showed that erdosteine and its active metabolite, at concentrations consistent with an approved therapeutic human dosage, were not directly cytotoxic and had significant antiviral effects in cells pre-infected with SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and H1N1. The transcriptome analysis showed that erdosteine activated innate immune responses by stimulating overexpression of type I interferon and inflammasome pathways and modulated oxidative stress by inducing the modulation of oxidative stress and GSH pathways. These findings suggest that erdosteine may be a useful treatment for respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids.

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular complications are a hallmark of Post-Acute Sequelae of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC), yet the mechanisms driving persistent cardiac dysfunction remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction in immune cells as a key contributor. This study investigated whether CD14++ monocytes from long COVID patients exhibit bioenergetic impairment, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, and defective oxidative stress adaptation, which may underlie cardiovascular symptoms in PASC. CD14++ monocytes were isolated from 14 long COVID patients with cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, angina) and 10 age-matched controls with similar cardiovascular risk profiles. Mitochondrial function was assessed using a Seahorse Agilent Analyzer under basal conditions and after oxidative stress induction with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured via Tetramethylrhodamine Ethyl Ester (TMRE) assay, mtDNA integrity via qPCR, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dynamics via Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Parallel experiments exposed healthy monocytes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to evaluate direct viral effects. CD14++ monocytes from long COVID patients with cardiovascular symptoms (n = 14) exhibited profound mitochondrial dysfunction compared to age-matched controls (n = 10). Under oxidative stress induced by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), long COVID monocytes failed to upregulate basal respiration (9.5 vs. 30.4 pmol/min in controls, p = 0.0043), showed a 65% reduction in maximal respiration (p = 0.4035, ns) and demonstrated a 70% loss of spare respiratory capacity (p = 0.4143, ns) with significantly impaired adaptation to BSO challenge (long COVID + BSO: 9.9 vs. control + BSO: 54 pmol/min, p = 0.0091). Proton leak, a protective mechanism against ROS overproduction, was blunted in long COVID monocytes (3-fold vs. 13-fold elevation in controls, p = 0.0294). Paradoxically, long COVID monocytes showed reduced ROS accumulation after BSO treatment (6% decrease vs. 1.2-fold increase in controls, p = 0.0015) and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (157 vs. 113.7 TMRE fluorescence, p = 0.0179), which remained stable under oxidative stress. mtDNA analysis revealed severe depletion (80% reduction, p < 0.001) and region-specific damage, with 75% and 70% reductions in amplification efficiency for regions C and D (p < 0.05), respectively. In contrast, exposure of healthy monocytes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein did not recapitulate these defects, with preserved basal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity, though coupling efficiency under oxidative stress was reduced (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID syndrome arises from maladaptive host responses rather than direct viral toxicity, characterized by bioenergetic failure, impaired stress adaptation, and mitochondrial genomic instability. This study identifies persistent mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID monocytes as a critical driver of cardiovascular complications in PASC. Key defects—bioenergetic failure, impaired stress adaptation and mtDNA damage—correlate with clinical symptoms like heart failure and exercise intolerance. The stable elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential and resistance to ROS induction suggest maladaptive remodeling of mitochondrial physiology. These findings position mitochondrial resilience as a therapeutic target, with potential strategies including antioxidants, mtDNA repair agents or metabolic modulators. The dissociation between spike protein exposure and mitochondrial dysfunction highlights the need to explore host-directed mechanisms in PASC pathophysiology. This work advances our understanding of long COVID cardiovascular sequelae and provides a foundation for biomarker development and targeted interventions to mitigate long-term morbidity.">

        <tr id="Individuals with underlying chronic inflammatory conditions are prone to increased morbidity when posed with an additional inflammatory challenge such as an injury or infection, but why this occurs remains unclear. Herein, we address this question in mouse models by demonstrating that chronic inflammation results in a pronounced expansion of circulating immature neutrophils that exhibit dysregulated effector functions as determined by single cell RNA sequencing and ex vivo functional assays. We show that these immature neutrophils are associated with and contribute to increased immunopathology in response to a new inflammatory challenge. Blocking the migration or function of these immature neutrophils through the administration of therapeutic antibodies or small molecules, profoundly lowers the immunopathology caused by the inflammatory challenge. Together, these studies establish a causal link between immature neutrophils and increased immunopathology, while also providing insights into new therapeutic strategies for treating individuals with chronic inflammatory ailments.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is characterized by persistent symptoms lasting beyond 12 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathomechanims remain poorly understood.


METHODS
We conducted detailed immunological analyses in 47 individuals with PCS, assessed >12 weeks post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and compared them to 25 convalescent controls without symptoms. We performed immune phenotyping of T and B cell subsets, assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific responses using activation-induced marker (AIM) flow cytometry for T cells, and tetramer staining of spike-specific B cells. Cytokine levels in peptide-stimulated cell supernatants and plasma were quantified using a Luminex platform.


RESULTS
PCS individuals exhibited reduced frequencies of AIM+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells (OX40+, PDL1+) and CD8 T cells (CD137+, CD69+) following petide stimulation with S- or N-Antigen, accompanied by diminished IFNγ and IL2 as measured in the cell culture supernatants. In contrast, non-virus specific T cell populations, including their memory differentiation, activation and helper cell differentiation status did not differ between the groups. PCS individuals showed a significant increase in total (CD19+) and activated B cells (CD86+, HLA-DR+), but not in SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific B cells (∼0.2% of total B cells). Plasma cytokine analysis revealed elevated markers associated with vascular damage and inflammation in PCS individuals.


CONCLUSION
Persistent immune disturbances in individuals with PCS are characterized by reduced SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, increased B cell activation, and altered inflammatory and vascular biomarkers. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of PCS and may contribute to biomarker discovery and therapeutic development.Trialnumber: DRKS00030974registry's URL: https://www.bfarm.de/EN/BfArM/Tasks/German-Clinical-Trials-Register/_node.html.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astroviruses are a common cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans and have been linked to fatal cases of encephalitis. A major barrier to the study of human-infecting astroviruses is the lack of an in vivo model as previous attempts failed to identify a host that supports viral replication. We describe a novel murine model of infection using astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1), an astrovirus with high seroprevalence in humans. VA1 is cardiotropic, and viral RNA levels peak in the heart tissue 7 days post-inoculation in multiple different murine genetic backgrounds. Infectious VA1 particles could be recovered from heart tissue 3 and 5 days post-inoculation. Viral capsid was detected intracellularly in the heart tissue by immunostaining, and viral RNA was detected in cardiac myocytes, endocardium, and endothelial cells based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. Histologically, we identified inflammatory infiltrates consistent with myocarditis in some mice, with viral RNA colocalizing with the infiltrates. These foci contained CD3 +T cells and CD68 +macrophages. Viral RNA levels increased by >10 fold in the heart tissue or serum samples from Rag1 or Stat1 knockout mice, demonstrating the role of both adaptive and innate immunity in the response to VA1 infection. Based on the in vivo tropisms, we tested cardiac-derived primary cells and determined that VA1 can replicate in primary human cardiac endothelial cells, suggesting a novel cardiovascular tropism in human cells. This novel in vivo model of a human-infecting astrovirus enables further characterization of the host immune response and reveals a new cardiovascular tropism of astroviruses. IMPORTANCE Astroviruses routinely cause infections in humans; however, few methods were available to study these viruses. Here, we describe the first animal system to study human-infecting astroviruses by using mice. We demonstrate that mice are susceptible to astrovirus VA1, a strain that commonly infects humans and has been linked to fatal brain infections. The virus infects the heart tissue and is associated with inflammation. When mice with impaired immune systems were infected with VA1, they were found to have higher amounts of the virus in their hearts and blood. We found that VA1 can infect cells from human blood vessels of the heart, which is associated with human health. This model will enable us to better understand how astroviruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection. Our findings also suggest that astroviruses could be linked to cardiovascular diseases, including in humans.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 can cause a variety of post-acute sequelae including Long COVID19 (LC), a complex, multisystem disease characterized by a broad range of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive impairment, and post-exertional malaise. The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 (~4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.">

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a prevalent condition whose recurrence leads to multiple adverse effects. Previous studies on INS pathogenesis primarily focused on immune dysregulation, particularly T-cell changes and their correlation with cytokine shifts. Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell dysfunction also plays a role. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effective treatment strategies remains incomplete. Methods This study investigates changes in gene expressions and cellular interactions of immune cells at a single-cell level using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). And subsequently validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. Results We identified seven main clusters using unsupervised clustering of 103,213 high-quality single cells. Through unsupervised clustering, patient-specific T cells (IFI44L + CD4 + T cells) that exhibited a pronounced elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is identified. Activation of ISGs and interferon (IFN)-related pathways are also observed in other clusters. Specifically, this study demonstrates that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role by promoting the interaction between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and receptors on B cells. This interaction triggers the release of autoantibodies, thereby initiating INS pathogenesis. Furthermore, telitacicept has shown efficacy in treating pediatric patients with frequent relapse NS(FRNS). Conclusions Overall, our findings underscore the role of interferon and its related pathways in INS pathogenesis, providing novel therapeutic interventions for NS.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has significantly affected global health, with severe inflammatory responses leading to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in the modulation of immune responses, but their involvement in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and senescence remains unclear. Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cell-1 (TREM-1) are myeloid cell receptors that amplify inflammation, described as a biomarker of the severity and mortality of COVID-19. This study investigated the composition and effects of macrophage-derived EVs stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 (MφV-EVs) on the recipient cell response. Our results, for the first time, show that SARS-CoV-2 stimulation modifies the cargo profile of MφV-EVs, enriching them with TREM-1 and miRNA-155 association, along with MMP-9 and IL-8/CXCL8. These EVs carry senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components, promote cellular senescence, and compromise antibacterial defenses upon internalization. Our findings provide evidence that MφV-EVs are key drivers of inflammation and immune dysfunction, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive, human-specific commensal infectious pathogen, poses a significant global health threat, especially in children under five, often resulting in fatalities. The intricacies of the immune response in pneumococcal meningitis (PM) remain elusive, necessitating a meticulous examination of immune cell subsets at the single-cell resolution. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PM patients and healthy individuals. We found significant relative changes in the compositions of immune cell subset, with significant relative increases in platelets, neutrophils, and their precursors, alongside relative decreases in natural killer (NK) cells, T cell subtypes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PM patients. Functional enrichment analyses revealed an up-regulation of neutrophils-related immune genes across multiple immune cell types, including platelets, myeloid cells and B cells, suggesting excessive neutrophil activation. However, a down-regulation of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation in myeloid cells and B cells in the PM group indicated a relative dampening of the adaptive immune response in the PM patients. This was further corroborated by the reduced proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T cells. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxity were down-regulated in both NK cells and T cells, alongside impaired T cell activation. Notably, distinct B cell subtypes, including unique naïve B cell clusters, demonstrated differentially expressed genes associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of immune responses in PM. The identified cellular and molecular signatures offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention and provide a foundation for further investigation into the immunopathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis.">

However, no systematic studies have been reported from infants hospitalized with severe disease. We applied a multidimensional approach to decipher the immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infected infants (n = 26; 10 subacute, 11 moderate and 5 severe disease; median age = 1.6 months) and matched controls (n = 14; median age = 2 months). Single cell (scRNA-seq) profiling of PBMCs revealed substantial alterations in cell composition in SARS-CoV-2 infected infants; with most cell-types switching to an interferon-stimulated gene (ISGhi) state including: (i) CD14+ monocytes co-expressing ISGs and inflammasome-related molecules, (ii) ISGhi naive CD4+ T cells, (iii) ISGhi proliferating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and (iv) ISGhi naive and transitional B cells. We observe increased serum concentrations of both interferons and inflammatory cytokines in infected infants. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are also consistently detected in the absence of anti-IFN autoantibodies. Compared with infected adults, infants display a similar ISG signature in monocytes but a markedly enhanced ISG signature in T and B cells. These findings provide insights into the distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of life and underscore the importance of further defining the unique features of early life immunity.">

        <tr id="The Coronaviridae family has again demonstrated the potential for significant neurological complications in humans during the recent pandemic. In patients, these symptoms persist throughout the infection, often lasting for months. The consequences of most of these post-infection symptoms might be linked with abnormal cytokine production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression, resulting in neuron damage. We investigated the effect of infection with the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) JHM strain and Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) on a primary microglia and astrocyte culture by analysing ROS production, cytokine and chemokine expression, and cell death during one month post infection. For this purpose, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and a high-throughput Luminex ProcartaPlex immunopanel for 48 cytokines and chemokines were utilised. The replication of MHV-JHM and SDAV in microglia and astrocytes has increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The cytokine expression induced by the two viruses differed, as did their detection after infection. SDAV infection resulted in a much broader cytokine response compared to that of MHV-JHM. Both viruses significantly increased ROS levels and induced apoptosis in a small percentage of the cells, but without necrosis.">

This study aims to compare the immune phenotype of patients with LTBI/COVID-19 to those with COVID-19 alone, in order to assess whether latent tuberculosis infection induces significant immune cell alterations. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured and stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (M. bovis BCG) to evaluate cellular distribution and function. Results the LTBI/COVID-19 group exhibited a narrower range of symptoms and required less complex treatment regimens than the COVID-19 group. The cellular evaluation revealed that individuals with COVID-19 displayed a distinct immune profile, characterized by a predominance of monocytes expressing pro-inflammatory and regulatory markers, including TNFR2, HLA-DR+TNFR2, and CD71. While CD4+ T cell subpopulation distribution and function were similar across groups, LTBI/COVID-19 and COVID-19 exhibited similar frequencies of CD8+perforin+ and CD8+Granzime B+ T cells. However, LTBI/COVID-19 displays lower soluble levels of granzyme B and perforin in culture supernatants and perforin, granulysin, and sFas in plasma compared to COVID-19. Notably, CD8+ T cells from LTBI/COVID-19 showed higher antigen-specific degranulation than COVID-19. Moreover, LTBI/COVID-19 individuals predominantly displayed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with highly polarized, compact mitochondria at baseline, which remained unchanged under stimulation. In contrast, COVID-19 had T cells with highly polarized, fragmented mitochondria at baseline, a profile that persisted under stimulation. Conclusion The findings reveal significant alterations in monocytes and T cells of individuals with LTBI/COVID-19, suggesting that co-infection may induce changes in the cellular phenotype and cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes severe intestinal damage and high mortality in neonatal piglets. The continuous emergence of new strains has brought new challenges to prevention and control. In this study, we isolated and characterized a prevalent PEDV virulent strain and analyzed 19,612 jejunal cells from PEDV-infected and control piglets using single-cell sequencing, revealing significant changes in cellular composition, gene expression, and intercellular communication. In response to PEDV infection, epithelial repair was enhanced through increased proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, transit-amplifying (TA) cells, and intestinal progenitor cells into enterocytes. Additionally, PEDV disrupted intercellular communication, compromising epithelial functionality while triggering immune responses, with IFN-γ and IL-10 signaling activation acting as critical regulators of immune balance and tissue homeostasis. Beyond enterocytes, viral genes were detected in various other cell types. Further experiments confirmed that PEDV could initiate replication in B and T lymphocytes but was unable to produce infectious progeny, with T cells additionally undergoing virus-induced apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into PEDV tropism, immune evasion, and epithelial repair, revealing complex host-pathogen interactions that shape disease progression and tissue regeneration, thereby contributing to a better understanding of enteric coronavirus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE The persistent circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) poses a major threat to the swine industry, with emerging strains complicating prevention and control efforts. Currently, no effective measures completely prevent virus transmission, highlighting the need to understand PEDV-host interactions. In this study, we isolated a prevalent virulent strain and used single-cell sequencing to identify new PEDV-infected cell types and explore the complex interplay between the host and PEDV. These findings provide essential insights into viral pathogenesis and facilitate the design of targeted antiviral interventions.

        <tr id="Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is associated with milder COVID-19 symptoms than previous strains. This study analyzed alterations in natural killer (NK) cell-associated immunity dynamics in mild and moderate COVID-19 cases during the Omicron phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients aged ≥16 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalized at Tottori University Hospital between January 2022 and May 2022. A total of 27 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 11 and 16 were diagnosed with mild and moderate COVID-19, respectively, based on the Japanese COVID-19 clinical practice guideline. Peripheral blood NK cell subsets and surface markers, including the activating receptor NKG2D and the inhibitory receptor TIGIT, as well as serum levels of 24 immunoregulatory markers, such as cytokines and cytotoxic mediators, were measured at admission and recovery. In addition, to explore immune patterns associated with disease severity, differences in 24 serum markers and soluble UL16-binding protein 2 (sULBP2) at the clinically most symptomatic time point during hospitalization were visualized using a volcano plot and analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Results Patients with mild COVID-19 exhibited expanded subsets of unconventional CD56dimCD16- NK cells with elevated NKG2D expression and lower levels of cytotoxic mediators (granzyme A, granzyme B, and granulysin). In contrast, patients with moderate disease exhibited NK cell exhaustion, characterized by upregulation of TIGIT, along with increased levels of NK cell-associated cytokines and cytotoxic mediators. The volcano plot identified that the patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited significantly elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed that IL-6, IFN-γ, soluble Fas, and CXCL8 were correlated with increased sULBP2. The PCA identified distinct clusters based on disease severity. Conclusions The results of study highlight the differences in NK cell-associated immune alterations between mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. Elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels, along with their correlations with inflammatory mediators, reflects differences in immune response based on disease severity. These findings provide insight into the immune response to infection caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and improve our understanding of its immunological features.">

        <tr id="Background The symptomatic and immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination of people with Long COVID are poorly characterized. Methods In this prospective study, we evaluated changes in symptoms and immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination in 16 vaccine-naïve individuals with Long COVID. Surveys were administered before vaccination and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose of the primary series. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCR enrichment, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, antibody responses to other viral and self-antigens, and circulating cytokines were quantified before vaccination and at 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination. Results At 12 weeks post-vaccination, self-reported improved health is seen in 10 out of 16 participants, 3 have no change, and 3 have worse health although 2 report transient improvement after vaccination. One participant reporting worse health was hospitalized twice with chest pain (after each dose). Symptom outcomes are most associated with plasma biosignatures. Higher baseline sIL-6R is associated with symptom improvement, and stably elevated levels of IFN-β and CNTF are associated with no improvement. Significant elevation in SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs and spike protein-specific IgG are observed at 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination. No changes in reactivities are observed against herpes viruses and self-antigens. Conclusions In this study of 16 people with Long COVID, vaccination is associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific IgG and T cell expansion in most participants. Specific immune features are associated with symptom change after vaccination and most participants experience improved health or no change following vaccination.">

        <tr id="The Global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 was initiated by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In addition to conventional pulmonary lesions, a range of neurological injury symptoms have been identified in clinical practice, but the aetiology of neurological disorders linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains poorly understood. Syrian hamsters, which are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, exhibit a disease phenotype similar to that observed in human COVID-19 patients. In this study, a hamster model of COVID-19 infection was used to analyze molecular changes in different tissues at various time points post infection with distinct strains using proteomic and phosphoproteomic approaches. Multi-omics analysis showed that SARS-COV-2 infection triggers sustained downregulation of the abundance and phosphorylation levels of neuronal and synapse-associated proteins in the brain, suggesting that neuronal damage persists even during the recovery period. Additionally, infections with SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the onset of long-term symptoms of COVID-19 by impacting energy metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic transmission pathways. This study provides a comprehensive molecular profile of hamsters infected with different SARS-CoV-2 strains in different tissues, offering foundational insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound impact on global health, with nearly 800 million cases reported in the Americas alone. The clinical presentation of the disease is highly variable, with approximately half of all patients experiencing severe symptoms. This variability confounds the complex interplay between immune responses and disease severity. Severe cases are often characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. Over 88% of COVID-19 patients have multiple comorbidities; factors such as age and pre-existing conditions further modulate immune responses and contribute to the severity of the disease. While some studies have reported differences in cytokine profiles between severity groups, larger, well-designed cohorts are needed to clarify these relationships. Natural Killer cells, which are critical for the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2, are often impaired and contribute to immune exhaustion. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 evades innate immune defenses through accessory proteins that inhibit interferon signaling and exacerbate cytokine storms and inflammation. This integrative review aims to synthesize findings from 2020 onward and provide insights into the innate immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and their contributions to disease pathogenesis. Understanding cytokine dynamics, NK cell behaviors, and viral immune evasion strategies is critical for advancing therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Background Pregnant women are considered a high-risk population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as the virus can infect the placenta and embryos. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been widely reported to cause retinal pathological changes and to infect the embryonic retina. The infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is primarily mediated through spike (S) protein, which also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, it remains poorly understood how the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 affects retinal development, and the underlying mechanism has not yet been clarified. Methods We used human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids (hEROs) as a model to study the effect of S protein exposure at different stages of retinal development. hEROs were treated with 2 μg/mL of S protein on days 90 and 280. Immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR were performed to assess the influence of S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages. Results The results showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the receptors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, were expressed in hEROs. Exposure to the S protein induced an inflammatory response in both the early and late stages of retinal development in the hEROs. Additionally, RNA sequencing indicated that early exposure of the S protein to hEROs affected nuclear components and lipid metabolism, while late-stages exposure resulted in changes to cell membrane components and the extracellular matrix. Conclusion This work highlights the differential effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced developmental impairments in the human retina.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological issues, including cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19, is also a risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation in COVID-19 patients, and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD. SARS-CoV-2 also induces cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We hypothesized that eNOS deficiency would worsen neuroinflammation, senescence, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and hypercoagulability in eNOS-deficient mice. Six-month-old eNOS+/− (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and wild-type (WT) male mice were infected with mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2. Mice were evaluated for weight loss, viral load, and markers of inflammation and senescence 3 days post-infection. eNOS+/− mice showed more weight loss (~15%) compared to WT mice (~5%) and increased inflammatory markers (Ccl2, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, IL-1β, and IL-6) and senescence markers (p53 and p21). They also exhibited higher microglial activation (Iba1) and increased plasma coagulation and BBB permeability, despite comparable lung viral loads and absence of virus in the brain. This is the first experimental evidence demonstrating that eNOS deficiency exacerbates SARS-CoV-2-induced morbidity, neuroinflammation, and brain senescence, linking eNOS to COVID-19-related neuropathology.">

Ineffective immune responses enable persistent HBV infection and contribute to progressive liver disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying immunological HBV tolerance and restoring functional adaptive immune responses is essential for successful chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment. This study examined the dysregulated immune responses and immunopathological cell states associated with CHB using single‐cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to investigate immune cell composition and transcriptional differences between patients with CHB and healthy donors. Phenotypic alterations in the lymphoid and myeloid compartments were observed following HBV infection. T cell immune profiling in patients with CHB showed enrichment of exhausted CD8+ T cells, impaired cytotoxicity of effector CD8+ T cells, and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) suppressive activity. Immature neutrophils and a unique CD14+ monocyte subset (myeloid‐derived suppressor cells) exhibited potent immunosuppressive abilities. A novel population of CD14+CD163+VSIG4+ M2‐like macrophages with immunosuppressive and anti‐inflammatory phenotypes was enriched in a patient with severe CHB and liver failure, indicating a potential contribution to dysfunctional immune responses. Our study demonstrated immune exhaustion and evasion in chronic HBV infection, elucidating its immunopathological features and suggesting new therapeutic strategies for immune‐mediated disorders and unresolved chronic HBV infection.">

        <tr id="With the concurrent circulations of SARS-CoV-2 omicron and influenza A viruses in the community, there is evidence showing co-infection with both viruses. However, disease severity may vary due to the complex immunity landscape of the patients and the neutralizing antibody waning status. The intrinsic dynamic relationship and pathological significance for such co-infections remain largely unknown. The replication kinetics and innate immune responses from the co-infections of SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron BA.1 and D614G variant) and influenza A viruses (pandemic H1N1, seasonal H3N2 and highly pathogenic avian H5N1) were characterized in human respiratory tissue explants, human airway, and alveolar epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 reduced the replication of influenza A viruses, but not vice versa, during co-infections in human bronchial tissues and airway epithelial cells. In lung tissues, the co-infections showed minimal effects on each other, but the viral replications of the two viruses were mutually reduced except for H1N1pdm in the alveolar epithelial cells irrespective of the enhancement of the ACE2 receptor. Notably, the co-infections showed a significant upregulation of the innate immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to single infections in both respiratory epithelial cells, suggesting that co-infections of influenza A viruses potentially lead to more severe damage to the host than SARS-CoV-2 single infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite over 13 billion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses administered globally, persistent post-vaccination symptoms, termed post-COVID-19 vaccine syndrome (PCVS), resemble post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Symptoms like cardiac, vascular, and neurological issues often emerge shortly after vaccination and persist for months to years, mirroring PASC. We previously showed the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein persists in CD16+ monocytes after infection, potentially driving PASC. Approved vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, AstraZeneca) deliver synthetic S1 to elicit immunity, suggesting a shared mechanism. We hypothesized that vaccine-derived S1 persistence in CD16+ monocytes sustains inflammation akin to PASC, contributing to PCVS. We studied 50 individuals with PCVS symptoms lasting over 30 days post-vaccination and 26 asymptomatic controls, using (1) machine learning-based immune profiling to compare cytokine signatures with PASC, (2) flow cytometry to detect S1 in CD16+ monocytes, and (3) LC-MS to confirm S1 across vaccine types. We correlated S1 persistence with symptom duration and inflammation. Prior infection was excluded via clinical history, anti-nucleocapsid antibody tests, and T-detect assays, though definitive tests are lacking. Preliminary findings suggest S1 persistence in CD16+ monocytes and an associated inflammatory profile may contribute to PCVS. Further studies are needed to confirm causality and prevalence.">

        <tr id="Objectives To evaluate the immune persistence and cross-immune response of elderly individuals after Omicron BA.5 infections. Method The neutralizing antibodies against WT, BA.5, XBB.1 and EG.5 strains were analyzed. The T/B-cell subsets’ responses were tested through intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Results The neutralizing antibodies titers against WT and BA.5 strain, remaining high level for at least 6 months, were higher than that of both XBB.1 and EG.5 variants. The neutralizing antibodies of WT, BA.5, XBB.1, and EG.5 strains in the elderly were slightly lower than those in middle-age. The memory B cells decreased rapidly in the elderly, and Tfh, Th17 cells of the elderly continued to increase for only 3 months, while Tfh and Th17 cells increased in the middle-aged for over 6 months. For the elderly, after peptide stimulation, unswitched/switched memory B cells decreased, while double negative B cells displayed higher proliferation. The proportions of both naïve and Temra cells in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells declined, whereas those of Tcm and Tem cells elevated. In the meantime, both CD69+ and CD38+ T cells decreased, but the frequencies of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed an increasing trend. The proportions of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ cells also increased in older people with long COVID symptoms at 3m post-infection. Conclusions Omicron BA.5 infection induced lower neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1 and EG.5 variant. The decrease of memory B cells, CD69+ and CD38+T cells, as well as the increase of PD-1+, CTLA-4+ of CD4+/CD8+T cells and double negative B cells, indicate that sustained immune responses against BA.5 infection may wane more rapidly in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="Introduction A hallmark of many lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) is the alteration of immune responses, often starting before the onset of clinical disease. The present study aimed to investigate how GM1 gangliosidosis impacted the course of an acute central nervous system (CNS) virus infection before the clinical onset of LSD. Methods For this purpose, Glb1 -/- and wildtype control mice (both C57BL/6 background) were intracerebrally infected with the BeAn strain of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) at the age of 5 weeks and sacrificed 4, 7, 14 and 98 days post infection, respectively. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry was used to assess viral load and immune cell activation and infiltration. Results Both wildtype and Glb1 -/- mice were able to clear the virus from the CNS and did not develop any clinical symptoms of TMEV-associated disease, thus indicating no overt alteration in susceptibility to TMEV infection. However, in the early phase post infection, Glb1 -/- mice displayed a slightly delayed T cell response as well as an increase in the number and activation of CNS microglia. Discussion These results suggest that already in the early stage of disease (before clinical onset) GM1 gangliosidosis causes an impaired T cell response and microglial hyperreactivity.">

        <tr id="Background: Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) progresses to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and is a major cause of liver cirrhosis. Although liver inflammation is the hallmark feature of MASH versus MASLD, the involvement of the peripheral immune cell compartments in disease progression is poorly understood, and single-cell profiles of peripheral immune cells in MASLD/MASH are not known. Methods: Patients with MASLD/MASH and healthy volunteers have been prospectively enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Patients have been histologically stratified and further characterized by liver bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Peripheral immune cells from patients and control blood samples have been comprehensively profiled using bulk and single RNA-Seq. Results: Twenty-two patients with fibrosis stage less than F3 have been histologically stratified into patients with low, medium, and high disease activity scores (NAFLD activity score [NAS]). In contrast to fibrosis, the NAS group correlated with noninvasive imaging readouts and blood biomarkers of liver damage and inflammation (ALT, AST). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity increased with the NAS stage. Bulk RNA-seq profiling of patient liver biopsies revealed gene signatures that were positively and negatively associated with NAS. Known marker genes for liver fibrosis where upregulated on RNA level. Blood bulk RNA-seq showed only moderate differences in patients versus healthy controls. In contrast, single-cell analysis of white blood cells revealed multiple alterations of immune (sub-)populations, including an increased abundance of immature B cells and myeloid suppressor cells in patients with MASLD/MASH as compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: The study gives new insights into the pathophysiology of MASLD/MASH already manifesting relatively early in peripheral immune cell compartments. This opens new avenues for the development of new biomarker diagnostics and disease therapies.">

Most research into these neurological sequalae focuses on the CNS, disregarding the PNS. Guinea pigs were previously shown to be useful models of disease during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic. However, their suitability for studying SARS-CoV-2 has not been experimentally demonstrated. To assess the suitability of guinea pigs as models for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the PNS, and to determine routes of CNS invasion through the PNS, we intranasally infected wild-type Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020. We assessed PNS sensory neurons (trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia), autonomic neurons (superior cervical ganglia), brain regions (olfactory bulb, brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus), lungs, and blood for viral RNA (RT-qPCR), protein (immunostaining), and infectious virus (plaque assay) at three- and six-days post infection. We show that guinea pigs, which have previously been used as a model of SARS-CoV-1 pulmonary disease, are not susceptible to intranasal infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, and are not useful models in assessing neurological impacts of infection with SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the early pandemic.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction. Pre-existing immunity to human coronaviruses (HCoVs) may shape the immune response in COVID-19 patients. Increasing evidence suggests that immune cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may determine clinical prognosis. Hypothesis. SARS-CoV-2 disease severity is influenced by pre-existing immunity to HCoVs, with distinct antibody profiles and cross-reactivity patterns. Aim. To investigate the antibody response of ICU and non-ICU SARS-CoV-2 patients against different HCoV proteins and assess the potential impact of pre-existing immunity on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcomes. Methodology. This study used a comprehensive HCoVs antigen bead array to measure antibody response to pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and the four seasonal HCoVs in 70 ICU and 63 non-ICU COVID-19 patients. Results. Our analysis demonstrates an overall higher antibody response in ICU than in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the anti-S1 IgG and IgA were significantly higher among ICU than in non-ICU patients. Similarly, the anti-S1 IgG against NL63 showed a lower response among ICU compared to non-ICU. Cross-reactivity was evident between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV antibodies but not with MERS-CoV and seasonal HCoVs. The subclass analysis of antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV-2 revealed that anti-S1 IgG1, IgG3, IgA1 and IgA2 were significantly higher in ICU compared to non-ICU. The predominant IgA subtype among SARS-CoV-2 patients was IgA1. We applied machine learning algorithms to subclass serological responses to build classifiers that could distinguish between ICU patients and patients with milder COVID-19. Out of 90 variables used in two different types of models, the variable of highest influence in determining the ICU status was IgG3 against SARS-CoV-2 S, and the top 8 variables of influence included the presence of IgG3 against S-trimer as well as IgA against SARS-CoV-2 S. Conclusion. Understanding the complexities of humoral immunity in various patients is critical for early medical intervention, disease management, selective vaccination and passive immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite the diminishing global impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus continues to circulate and undergo mutations, posing ongoing challenges for public health. A comprehensive understanding of virus entry mechanisms is crucial for managing new epidemic strains. However, the cellular processes post-endocytosis remain largely unexplored. This study employs proximity labeling to examine proteins near ACE2 post-viral infection and identified syntaxin-6 (STX6) as a factor that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by impeding the endocytic release of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances early endosome recruitment of STX6. STX6 appears to hinder the maturation of viral particles-laden early endosomes into late endosomes, from which the virus could escape. Instead, it promotes the trafficking of the virus toward the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. STX6 exhibits a broad-spectrum effect against various SARS-CoV-2 variants and several other viruses that enter via endocytosis. We report for the first time the function of STX6 as a restrictive factor in viral infection. IMPORTANCE Virus entry is the first step of the virus life cycle, and the exploitation of the endo-lysosome pathway for cellular entry by viruses has been well documented. Meanwhile, the intrinsic defense present within cells interferes with virus entry. We identified STX6 as a host restriction factor for viral entry by facilitating the virus trafficking to the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. Notably, STX6 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants and other viruses employing endocytosis for entry.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The nasopharynx and its microbiota are implicated in respiratory health and disease. The interplay between viral infection and the nasopharyngeal microbiome is an area of increased interest. The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, on the nasopharyngeal microbiome among individuals living with HIV is not fully characterized. Here, we describe the nasopharyngeal microbiome before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a longitudinal cohort of Kenyan women (21 living with HIV and 14 HIV-uninfected) and their children (18 HIV-exposed, uninfected and 7 HIV-unexposed, uninfected) between September 2021 and March 2022. We show using genomic epidemiology that mother and child dyads were infected with the same strain of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant that spread rapidly across Kenya. We used metagenomic sequencing to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiome of 20 women and children infected with SARS-CoV-2, six children negative for SARS-CoV-2 but experiencing respiratory symptoms, and 34 timepoint-matched SARS-CoV-2-negative mothers and children. Since individuals were sampled longitudinally before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we could characterize the short- (within a week of infection) and longer- (average of 38 days post-infection) term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the nasopharyngeal microbiome. We found that mothers and children had significantly different microbiome composition and bacterial load (P-values < 0.0001). In both mothers and children, the nasopharyngeal microbiome did not differ before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of HIV exposure status. Our results indicate that the nasopharyngeal microbiome is resilient to SARS-CoV-2 infection and was not significantly modified by HIV. IMPORTANCE The nasopharyngeal microbiome plays an important role in human health. The degree of impact that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has on the nasopharyngeal microbiome varies among studies and may be influenced by diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants and variations in the microbiome between individuals. Our results show that the nasopharyngeal microbiome was not altered substantially by SARS-CoV-2 infection nor by HIV infection in mothers or HIV exposure in children. Our findings highlight the resilience of the nasopharyngeal microbiome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings advance our understanding of the nasopharyngeal microbiome and its interactions with viral infections. The nasopharyngeal microbiome plays an important role in human health.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease acquired through tick bites. We have previously demonstrated the correlation between SFTSV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation induction, disease progression, and fatal outcome. In the current study, our clinical observation study establishes a strong correlation between elevated levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA and poor prognosis. In vivo studies further reveal endothelial cells as an important source responsible for releasing mtDNA into circulation, which promotes B cell activation, migration, and differentiation via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Notably, TLR9 activation enhances B-cell susceptibility to SFTSV infection. These findings suggest that mtDNA released by injured endothelial cells facilitates B cell differentiation and virus replication, emphasizing the significant role of mitochondrial damage within endothelial cells in contributing to the severity of SFTS outcomes. IMPORTANCE Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a new acute tick-borne infectious disease with a high fatality rate of 10%–50%. There is a strong correlation between SFTSV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation induction, disease progression, and fatal outcome. Our research has revealed the crucial role of mtDNA in predicting the prognosis of SFTS and its impact on vascular endothelial injuries as well as B cell differentiation, two previously unexplored features of SFTSV infection. Moreover, mtDNA could activate the TLR9 signal to induce plasmablast differentiation in B cells and promote SFTSV infection. This study provides valuable mechanistic and clinical insights into the adverse outcomes associated with SFTSV infection.

        <tr id="Mitochondrial diseases (MtD) represent a significant public health challenge due to their heterogenous clinical presentation, often severe and progressive symptoms, and lack of effective therapies. Environmental exposures, such bacterial and viral infection, can further compromise mitochondrial function and exacerbate the progression of MtD. However, the underlying immune alterations that enhance immunopathology in MtD remain unclear. Here we employ in vitro and in vivo approaches to clarify the molecular and cellular basis for innate immune hyperactivity in models of polymerase gamma (Polg)-related MtD. We reveal that type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated upregulation of caspase-11 and guanylate-binding proteins (GBP) increase macrophage sensing of the opportunistic microbe Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in Polg mutant mice. Furthermore, we show that excessive cytokine secretion and activation of pyroptotic cell death pathways contribute to lung inflammation and morbidity after infection with PA. Our work provides a mechanistic framework for understanding innate immune dysregulation in MtD and reveals potential targets for limiting infection- and inflammation-related complications in Polg-related MtD.">

        <tr id="Background We have previously reported on natural humoral immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a Norwegian cohort between 2020 and 2021. In this study, we evaluated long-term humoral (including vaccination-induced) immunity in the same cohort and assessed predictors of high antibody levels against spike protein, as well as the persistence of antibodies against the virus spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Methods Vaccination data and antibody levels against the spike and nucleocapsid proteins were collected at 12 (only in infected participants) and 24 months (in both infected and uninfected participants) after the participants’ first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the virus. Antibody levels against spike protein at 24 months were categorized as high or low based on the 50th percentile. Possible predictors of high antibody levels against spike protein were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results Of 1119 original participants (400 PCR + and 719 PCR −), 574 responded to our questionnaires and were invited to antibody measurements (median age: 51 years; women: 59%). Vaccination data showed that 11% were fully immunized, and 85% were booster-immunized at 24 months. Antibody levels were evaluated in 72% (287/400) of the PCR + participants at 12 months and 58% (233/400) at 24 months. At 12 and 24 months, we observed that 97% (278/287) and 100% (233/233), respectively, still had antibodies against the spike protein, and 86% (248/287) and 95% (221/233), respectively, against the nucleocapsid protein. Antibody levels were also evaluated in 34% (247/719) of those in the PCR − group, which revealed that 99.5% and 69% had detectable antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid proteins, respectively, at 24 months. Irrespective of pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection status, the booster-immunized participants were 3.7 × more likely to have high antibody levels against spike protein vs the non-booster-immunized ones. Those aged > 60 years had the highest median antibody levels against the spike protein and were more likely to be booster-immunized. Conclusions Our findings highlight the benefits of booster vaccinations for humoral immune responses. Long-term antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were higher in booster-immunized participants vs the non-booster-immunized, irrespective of pre-vaccination infection status.

 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe postinfectious complication associated with SARS-CoV-2. Although the crucial pathogenic role of the monocyte compartment is known, information regarding the mechanisms and maintenance of the inflammatory trigger is lacking. Genetic variants in the OAS/RNase L pathway, involved in viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing and the modulation of inflammatory responses, have been identified in patients with MIS-C. We conducted a comprehensive analysis, including the study of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, blood biomarkers, and autoantibodies, as well as transcriptomic and proteomic profiling.



 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, and RNA samples from MIS-C patients were analyzed. PBMCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and inflammatory responses were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC). Apoptosis was assessed via annexin V staining. Type I interferon (IFN) signatures were measured using qPCR. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated using an automated ELISA system (ELLA). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed through bioinformatics pipelines, including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), while proteomics data were processed using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA).



 We found a monocyte exhaustion phenotype, demonstrated by reduced inflammasome activation in response to stimuli and an associated lack of IL-1β secretion (Figure 1A-B). Intriguingly, dsRNA was detected in monocytes from MIS-C patients even during follow-up, suggesting a long-lasting viral presence that could drive sustained immune activation (Figure 1C-D). Blood biomarker profiling, bulk RNA-seq, and proteomic analyses revealed a signature characterized by the activation of genes involved in antiviral response, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and coagulation pathways. Additionally, we observed anti-IL1RA autoantibodies in 40-50% of patients, consistent with previous reports.

(A) In vitro inflammatory cytokine secretion by MIS-C patients’ PBMCs (T1: 0 to 10 days from onset, T2: 10 to 30 days from onset, and T3: over 30 days from onset) of as measured in culture supernatant after 18 hours with or without stimulation with the indicated stimuli. The NLRP3 blocker MCC950 inhibited secretion, indicating that secretion of IL-1β is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome. (B) Percentages of spontaneous and after ASC specks detection in monocytes (left) and after stimulation (LPS+ATP, right) from controls (HD), MIS-C patients in acute stage (T1), and during follow-up (T2-3) by flow cytometry.

Data are expressed as median ± IQR. *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .005, ****P < .001 as assessed by Mann–Whitney t test.



 Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, encompassing monocyte exhaustion, persistence of intramonocytic dsRNA, autoantibody formation, and a distinct transcriptomic and proteomic signature. This study provides insights into the underlying mechanisms driving sustained inflammation in post-COVID syndromes.

        <tr id="Background: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection results in persistent liver inflammation, which ultimately leads to liver fibrosis and increases the risk of cirrhosis. Recruitment of circulating monocytes to the liver is an essential aspect that exacerbates liver fibrosis; however, the mechanism underlying their dysregulation, which contributes to this progression, remains unclear. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to characterize the landscape of circulating monocytes from patients with CHB and liver fibrosis (CHB group) and healthy controls (HC group). Conventional techniques were performed to validate the findings. Results: Monocytes significantly expanded in the CHB group. The proto-oncogene LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) was highly expressed in monocytes from the CHB group, which may be associated with their expansion. In addition, we noticed that a classical monocyte subcluster surged in the CHB group and highly expressed platelet-related genes such as ITGA2B, which was identified as monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPA). The frequency of MPA was significantly higher in the CHB group, positively associated with platelet and white blood cell, and negatively associated with liver fibroscan and age, which indicates that MPA may play an important role in liver inflammation in the early liver fibrosis stage. Moreover, we found that MPA displays the enrichment of chemokine signaling-associated genes, such as C-C chemokine motif ligand 5 (CCL5﻿), and showed an increased adhesion capacity to endothelial cells. After incubation with MPA cell supernatants, pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-8 and IL-1β were upregulated in LX-2 cells, which were reversed by the addition of anti-CCL5 antibodies. Conclusions: Our data suggest that enhanced LMO2﻿﻿﻿ expression in circulating monocytes may be associated with their expansion, and an increased MPA subset may participate in liver fibrosis progression. These results provide valuable insights into the etiology of liver fibrosis in patients with CHB.">

 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly burdened global public health. However, the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 within the human body remains not fully understood. In this review, we overview the literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection across various human organs and tissues. We summarize the relevant specimen types, techniques for examining SARS-CoV-2 tropism, and findings at both organ/tissue and cellular levels. To systematically evaluate the evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism, we establish a hierarchical classification system based on two key criteria: (1) specimen origin and (2) detection methodology. Clinical specimens obtained directly from COVID-19 patients provide the most definitive evidence, whereas organoid-derived specimens and animal models indicate potential infectivity under artificial conditions. In terms of detection methods, we prioritize viral particle identification over viral protein or RNA detection, as the latter requires further confirmation to establish productive infection. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 potentially targets multiple human organ systems, including the respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, pancreas, small intestine, liver, and salivary glands. By contrast, viral tropism for the central nervous system and the reproductive system remains uncertain and requires further validation. At the cellular level, we identify specific target cell types vulnerable to infection, including ciliated epithelial cells, alveolar type II pneumocytes, enterocytes, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, and pancreatic acinar cells. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor distribution patterns and viral tropism, as well as potential variations in tissue specificity among different viral variants. We expect this review to provide a comprehensive landscape of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and enhance our understanding of the life cycle and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the human body.

Here we examine three mid-lactation Holsteins challenged with ~ 150 CFU of Staphylococcus aureus (Newbould) that developed chronic mastitis as assessed by bacteria and somatic cell counts in a single quarter. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of blood and milk cells identified immune cell populations of interest from both tissues, and the proportion of cell types recovered via scRNA-seq were highly similar to those recovered via flow cytometry. Granulocytes were the predominating cell type in both blood and milk samples; however granulocytes identified via scRNA-seq revealed several clusters comprised primarily of milk-derived cells. Milk-enriched granulocyte clusters were further investigated to identify gene signatures indicative of the granulocyte-specific localized immune responses in the mammary gland during chronic mastitis infection. Biological process enrichment analysis of gene signatures further revealed relevant networks such as granulocyte migration, myeloid cell differentiation, and inflammatory responses. In total, the work describes the immune landscape occurring at both peripheral and local sites of cattle with mastitis and identified important granulocyte-specific features of the localized immune response occurring during chronic infection.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Porcine contagious pleuropneumonia caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is a fatal respiratory disease that threatens the worldwide farming industry’s health. The immune responses of extrapulmonary tissues play an important role in developing porcine contagious pleuropneumonia; however, the immune responses of extrapulmonary tissues induced by APP are rarely uncovered. Here, we used high-dimensional mass cytometry to investigate the immune cell response in the spleen and peripheral blood during APP infection in mice. We found that the immune response triggered by APP was highly tissue-specific. Numerous infection time- or tissue-specific immune cell clusters, including previously unrecognized ones, were also identified in the spleen and peripheral blood. Integrative analysis of splenic lymphoid and myeloid cell clusters maps the dynamic immune response cellular network during APP infection. Surprisingly, during the early stages of APP infection, the majority of the top 6 cell clusters contributing to the infection time-specificity in the spleen were adaptive immune cell clusters rather than innate immune cell clusters, among which CD24hiMHCII+CD8+TEM cells exhibited a stronger expression of IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-10 compared to the CD24lo compartment. In peripheral blood, there was unprecedented heterogeneity in the immune cell composition. Also, peripheral immune cell clusters closely related to the severity of APP infection were identified. In summary, our data provide a systemic and comprehensive overview of the immune responses to APP infection in the spleen and peripheral blood. This provides a foundation for understanding the immune pathogenesis of APP and identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. IMPORTANCE This study explored the cross-tissue immune dynamic landscape in the APP-induced pneumonia model by utilizing high-dimensional mass cytometry. We discovered that APP-induced immune responses are tissue-specific. Key infection-specific clusters in the spleen and peripheral blood were identified, some of which were previously unrecognized. Meanwhile, the specific functions of APP infection-related immune subsets were explored. The research systematically outlined an overview of immune responses in these tissues, deepening the understanding of APP pathogenesis and laying the foundation for the search for diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="Marsupial neonates are born with immature immune systems, making them vulnerable to pathogens. While neonates receive maternal protection, they can also independently combat pathogens, although the mechanisms remain unknown. Using the sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) as a model, we investigated immunological defense strategies of marsupial neonates. Cathelicidins—a family of antimicrobial peptides expanded in the genomes of marsupials—are highly expressed in developing neutrophils. Sugar glider cathelicidins reside in two genomic clusters, and their coordinated expression is achieved by enhancer sharing within clusters and long-range physical interactions between clusters. Functionally, cathelicidins modulate immune responses and have potent antibacterial effects, sufficient to provide protection in a mouse model of sepsis. Evolutionarily, cathelicidins have a complex history, with marsupials and monotremes uniquely retaining both clusters among tetrapods. Thus, cathelicidins are critical mediators of marsupial immunity, and their evolution may reflect the life history–specific immunological needs of these animals.">

This includes enrichment of proinflammatory CD11c+ B cells associated with altered IgG Fc glycosylation, adaptive NK cells with reduced responsiveness to accessory cytokines, and CD161+CD4+T cells with enhanced cytokine production in rural settings. Metabolic perturbation studies demonstrated distinct dependencies on glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and fatty acid synthesis for cellular cytokine responses across populations. We validate core rural-urban immune signatures in an independent Indonesian cohort, suggesting shared immunological adaptations to urbanization across ancestries and geographical areas. Our findings provide insights into rural-urban immune function in understudied populations.">

        <tr id="Background Long-COVID immunopathogenesis involves diverse factors. We longitudinally characterize hospitalized COVID-19 patients, examining the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and inflammation in immune dysregulation. Methods Hospitalized patients are evaluated during acute infection (T0), 3 months post-symptom onset (T1), and 3 years if symptoms persisted (T2). Immune profile includes characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-specific T/B cells (flow cytometry) and antibodies (ELISA, neutralization, ADCC). RNAemia and cytokines are quantified (RT-PCR, cytometric beads array) and correlated. Statistics: non-parametric cross-sectional, longitudinal and correlation analyses. Results Here we show 48 hospitalized individuals during acute COVID-19, 38 exhibit early persistent symptoms (EPS+) 3 months post-symptoms onset, 10 do not (EPS−). Groups are comparable for age, sex, co-morbidities. The EPS+ shows fatigue, dyspnoea, anosmia/dysgeusia, diarrhea, chronic pain, mnestic disorders. Over time, they show a reduction of neutralization ability and total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, with increased total CD4 TEMRA, and failure to increase RBD-specific B cells and IgA+ MBCs. EPS+ patients show higher levels of T0-IFN-γ + CD4 TEMRA, T1-IL-2 + CD4 TEM and T1-TNF-α + CD4 cTfh. In EPS+, baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia positively correlates with CD4 TEMRA, follow-up SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with ADCC. Among 38 EPS+ individuals at T1, 33 are evaluated 3 years after infection, 5 are lost at follow-up. 10/33 EPS+ show long-term symptoms (late persistent symptoms, EPS + LPS+), whereas 23/33 fully recover (EPS + LPS−). Antibodies, RNAemia, and cytokines show no differences between/within groups at any time point. Conclusions Early persistent symptoms are associated with multi-layered SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune dysregulation. The shift towards non-Ag-specific TEMRA and ADCC trigger in EPS+ may relate to SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Early immune dysregulation does not associate with long-term persistent symptoms. Further research on SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and early immune dysregulation is needed.">

        <tr id="Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) presents an emerging public threat due to its high mortality rate and ever‐expanding geographic distribution. However, characterization of SFTSV infection pathogenesis and immunological impact at single‐cell level remains underexplored. Here, we employ single‐cell transcriptome‐wide sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hospitalized SFTSV‐infected patients to map the immune landscape across acute and convalescent stages of infection. The results reveal significant alterations in immune cell compositions, along with profound disruption in intercellular crosstalk. B cells and neutrophils appear to be the primary target for SFTSV infection besides monocytes, as evidenced by heightened virus‐related pathways in these two cell types during the acute phase. In addition, SFTSV infection induces a substantial inflammatory response, which were prominently reflected in monocytes and neutrophils. These data illustrate the complex immune remodeling and inflammatory cascades triggered by SFTSV, with a particular focus on its effects on B cells and neutrophils, bringing novel insights into future therapeutic developments.">

        <tr id="Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae (PASC). However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts the brain and leads to persistent behavioral changes remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces neuroinflammation and microglial activation, leading to anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice. Methods: We established a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model using the virulent SARS2-N501YMA30 strain to investigate its impact on the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed neuroinvasion via immunostaining of dsRNA and markers for neuronal, astrocyte, and microglia in brain slices. Behavioral changes were evaluated at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4 months post-infection. Molecular and cellular analyses included bulk RNA-seq, Golgi-Cox staining, field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to assess gene expression, neuronal morphology, and microglial activation in the brain. Results: We demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral assays indicated a marked elevation in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors post-infection. A comparative analysis of RNA expression profiles disclosed alterations in the post-infected brains. Additionally, we observed dendritic spine remodeling on neurons within the amygdala after infection. Infection with SARS2-N501YMA30 was associated with microglial activation and a subsequent increase in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion plays a critical role in the development of lasting behavioral sequelae observed in PASC. These data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.">

        <tr id="Background Immune-related myocarditis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is a rare immune-related adverse event (irAE) but is characterized by a high mortality rate. However, the specific pathological mechanisms underlying immune-related myocarditis remain largely unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the inflammatory microenvironment within cardiac tissues affected by immune-related myocarditis at the single-cell level to identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on an endomyocardial biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma who developed immune-related myocarditis following treatment with ICIs. Additionally, the scRNA-seq data of heart specimens from deceased donors without cardiovascular diseases were collected and applied as normal control. To validate our findings and assess their specificity to ICI-related pathology, we analyzed mouse scRNA-seq data, including controls, ICI-related myocarditis, viral myocarditis, and autoimmune myocarditis. Results We found elevated proportions of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and fibroblasts in the irAE group, suggesting an intensified inflammatory microenvironment in human immune-related myocarditis. Within the lymphocyte compartment, increased proportions of CD8 + T exhausted cells and CD8 + T proliferative cells were observed in the irAE group. The upregulated differentially expressed genes in myeloid cells in the irAE group were enriched in pro-inflammatory pathways, consistent with the observed metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. CXCL9 + fibroblasts, characterized by the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and enriched in the JAK-STAT and TNFα signaling pathways, were predominantly found in the irAE group. Venous endothelial cells specifically expressing atypical chemokine receptor-1 (ACKR1) interacted with myeloid cells and CXCL9 + fibroblasts through the CXCL signaling pathway, facilitating chemokine transcytosis and leukocyte recruitment. Analysis of murine scRNA-seq data further supported these findings, revealing that exhausted CD8 + T cells and pro-inflammatory fibroblasts were uniquely enriched in ICI-related myocarditis, reflecting its distinct inflammatory microenvironment. Conclusions We elucidated the unique inflammatory microenvironment of immune-related myocarditis at the single-cell level. Our work revealed key cell subpopulations that were significantly implicated in inflammation, thus offering potential therapeutic targets.

While previous research on COVID-19 has primarily utilized nasal swabs and blood samples, these do not provide comprehensive insights into all the organ systems affected by the infection. A recent study by Topper et al. addressed this gap by analyzing both nasal samples and autopsy tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Their findings highlight a significant role of mitochondrial damage pathways and RAAS overactivation in contributing to the severity of SARSCoV- 2 infections.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Currently, the Omicron variant of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to circulate globally. In our multiplex respiratory pathogen detection, we identified numerous instances of co-infection with Echovirus (ECHO) among Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, which exacerbated the clinical symptoms of these patients. Such co-infections are likely to impact the subsequent medical treatment. To date, there are no reports on the pathogenic mechanisms related to COVID-19 co-infected with ECHO. Therefore, this study employed the TM Widely-Targeted metabolomics approach to analyze the serum metabolomes of COVID-19 patients with single SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), COVID-19 patients co-infected with ECHO (COVID-19  +  ECHO), and healthy individuals (Control) recruited from routine physical examinations during the same period. Concurrent clinical laboratory tests were performed on the patients to reveal the differences in metabolomic characteristics between the COVID-19 patients and the COVID-19  +  ECHO patients, as well as to explore potential metabolic pathways that may exacerbate disease progression. Our findings indicate that both clinical examination indicators and the pathways enriched by differential metabolites confirm that patients with dual infection exhibit higher inflammatory and immune responses compared to those with single COVID-19 infections. This difference is likely reflected through abnormalities in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway, with the metabolite Sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine playing a crucial role in this process. Finally, we established a diagnostic model based on logistic regression using five differential metabolites, which accurately differentiates between the dual infection population and the single COVID-19 infection population (AUC = 0.828).">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected hundreds of millions of people globally, resulting in millions of deaths. During this pandemic, children have demonstrated greater resistance than adults, exhibiting lower infection rates, reduced mortality, and milder symptoms. Summarizing the differences in resistance between children and adults during COVID-19 can provide insights into protective mechanisms and potential implications for future treatments. In this review, we focused on summarizing and discussing the mechanisms for better protection of children in COVID-19. These protective mechanisms encompass several factors: the baseline expression of cell surface receptor ACE2 and hydrolase TMPRSS2, the impact of complications on COVID-19, and age-related cytokine profiles. Additionally, differences in local and systemic immune responses between children and adults also contribute significantly, particularly interferon responses, heterologous protection from non-COVID-19 vaccinations, and immune status variations influenced by micronutrient levels. The advantageous protection mechanisms of these children may provide insights into the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Importantly, while age-related metabolic profiles and differential COVID-19 vaccine responses may contribute to protection in children, current comparative research remains limited and requires further investigation.">

        <tr id="Post-infection sequela of several viruses have been linked with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we investigated whether mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone or in combination with two putative Parkinsonian toxins, MPTP and paraquat, increased the susceptibility to develop Parkinsonian pathology. We also examined if G2019S LRRK2 mice had any change in sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 as well as if vaccination against this virus altered any neuropathology. Infection with WA-1/2020 or Omicron B1.1.529 strains sensitized both WT and G2019S LRRK2 mice to the neuropathological effects of a subtoxic exposure to MPTP, but not paraquat. These neuropathologies were rescued in WT mice vaccinated with mRNA- or protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice were only protected with the protein-based vaccine. These results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of Parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition (here abbreviated as post-COVID) is an escalating global health issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of post-COVID following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.We analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and anxiety. Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol.We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent.Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.">

We investigated the association between COVID-19-related mortality with the dynamics, magnitude, and relative avidity of nucleoprotein (N), spike (S), and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgM, IgA, and IgG in circulation. We also assessed the relationship between the virus-specific antibody responses and cytokine patterns, as well as systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation markers. This multicenter study included COVID-19 patients hospitalized early in the pandemic, classified as survivors (n=62) and non-survivors (n=17). We developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to evaluate each virus-specific isotype using well-characterized outpatient COVID-19 (n=180) and pre-pandemic cohorts (n=111). The pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, as well as the regulatory IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNFRI) levels were evaluated. The ELISAs performed highly for all virus-specific isotypes, although modest for IgM-N. Non-survivors increased N-specific, but no S-specific, IgM and IgA responses throughout the disease course and, more notably, a delayed class switching to IgG-S and IgG-RBD compared to survivors. No differences were observed in the virus-specific IgG relative avidity. Survivors exhibited an antibody response proportional to the degree of systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation, whereas non-survivors showed those dissociated because of their uncontrolled severe thromboinflammation. Only the survivors showed a dominant regulatory cytokine pattern in the early phase of infection (<10 days after symptoms onset), which strongly correlated with developing IgG-S and IgG-RBD protective antibodies. We developed easy-to-use immune assays that enable patient monitoring and identify at-risk populations in low- to middle-income regions. Non-survivors displayed an ineffective N-mediated antibody response, marked by an inability to control inflammation and a compromised time-dependent class switching toward S and RBD-specific IgG. The regulatory cytokine axis, including TGF-β1, maybe a critical immune correlate of effective antibody-mediated immunity in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), brought about by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly impacted public health and the economy. A fundamental aspect of addressing this virus lies in elucidating the mechanisms through which it induces disease. Our study reveals that Non-structural protein 6 (NSP6) of SARS-CoV-2 promotes the initiation of autophagy by activating Beclin1. In the later stage of autophagy, however, NSP6 causes a blockage in the autophagy–lysosome degradation via the inhibition of Mucolipin 1 (MLN1). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) L37F in NSP6, which is associated with asymptomatic infection, similarly enhances the initiation of autophagy but displays a reduced ability to impede lysosome-dependent degradation. In summary, we demonstrated the dual-regulation mechanism of NSP6 in autophagy, which may be one of the reasons for targeting cellular autophagy to induce viral pathogenesis. This finding may provide promising new directions for future research and clinical interventions.">

        <tr id="Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection associated intestinal manifestations including diarrhea and proctitis have been frequently reported during mpox outbreaks. The clade IIb MPXV strain has caused the 2022-2023 global outbreak, whereas the Ia and Ib strains are causing the concurrent outbreaks in Africa. Here, we found clinical evidence that MPXV can directly infect human intestine to induce lesions. Intriguingly, primary organoids cultured from human ileum and rectum support productive infections of MPXV clade IIb, Ia and Ib strains. Upon differentiation, we found that enterocytes and goblet cells but not enteroendocrine cells are capable of supporting viral replication. Given that primary intestinal organoids can be rapidly expanded in large scale, we were able to screen a broad-spectrum antiviral drug library. We identified 12 leading candidates of safe-in-human agents including clinically used drugs such as clofarabine. We extensively validated the anti-MPXV activity of clofarabine in human intestinal and skin organoids, and consistently demonstrated the potent antiviral activity against clade Ia, Ib and IIb strains. These findings are important for better understanding the clinical manifestations of mpox. Primary intestinal organoids based infection models and the established antiviral drug discovery pipeline bear major implications in responding to the current mpox global health emergency, and sustaining epidemic poxvirus preparedness.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of mathematical modeling for understanding viral infection dynamics and accelerated its application into immunological research. Collaborative efforts among international research groups yielded a wealth of experimental data, which facilitated model development and validation. This study focuses on developing a modular mathematical model of the immune response, capturing the interactions between innate and adaptive immunity, with an application to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The model was validated using experimental data from middle-aged individuals with moderate COVID-19 progression, including measurements of viral load in the upper and lower airways, serum antibodies, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and interleukin-6 levels. Parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis were performed to improve the model accuracy. Additionally, identifiability analysis was conducted to assess whether the data were sufficient for reliable parameter estimation. The verified model simulates the dynamics of moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 progressions using measured data on lung epithelium damage, viral load, and IL-6 levels as key indicators of disease severity. We also performed a series of validation scenarios to assess whether the model correctly reproduces biologically relevant behaviors under various conditions, such as immunity hyperactivation, co-infection with HIV, and interferon administration as a therapeutic strategy. The model was developed as a component of the Digital Twin project and represents a general immune module that integrates both innate and adaptive immunity. It can be utilized for further COVID-19 research or serve as a foundation for studying other infectious diseases, provided sufficient data are available.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused a global public health crisis, with a significant impact on multiple body systems. This virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, shows ~80% genomic similarity to SARS-CoV and ~50% genomic similarity to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The spike (S) protein plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the virus, as it facilitates its entry into host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In addition to the respiratory system damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a variety of gastrointestinal (GI), neurological, cardiovascular (CV), ocular, renal, etc. clinical manifestations. Neurological complications, such as anosmia, ague, headache, encephalitis and cerebrovascular events, were frequently observed, being attributed to both direct viral invasion and a very strong systemic inflammatory response. GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common and may occur independently of respiratory symptoms, and the presence of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) detected in fecal samples suggests possible fecal-oral transmission. The CV system is affected by myocardial damage, inflammation and coagulation disorders, with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. At the ocular level, the virus was identified in ocular secretions, and conjunctivitis, uveitis and episcleritis were observed in about 11% of patients. Renal involvement, manifested by acute kidney injury, was detected in 0.5-7% of cases. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to respiratory tract involvement but also has significant systemic implications.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tamdy virus (TAMV) is one of the zoonotic tick-borne bunyaviruses that have emerged as global public health threats in recent decades. To date, however, TAMV pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have established different mouse infection models to enable investigation of TAMV pathogenesis. Adult BALB/c mice did not exhibit obvious clinical symptoms or signs post-TAMV infection. In contrast, adult type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR−/−) A129 mice were found to be susceptible to high-doses of TAMV (6 × 102 and 6 × 104 FFU) and all developed severe clinical symptoms and signs, including weight loss and immobility, and reached the euthanasia criteria at 4/5-day post-infection (dpi). Viral RNA was detected in peripheral blood and different tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, and brain) of the high-dose infected adult A129 mice, with the highest viral loads in the liver (approximately 108.3 copies/μL). Pathological examination also revealed severe liver damage in the high-dose infected A129 mice. In addition, the titres of TAMV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies increased rapidly 4–5 dpi. Analysis of cytokine and chemokine expression changes demonstrated that type I IFN may play an important role in the host defence against viral infection by enhancing IL-10 production. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses showed that liver injury may be associated with virus-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Together, we have investigated TAMV pathogenesis using immunocompetent and immunocompromised mouse models, which will facilitate the development of TAMV-specific antivirals and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Background Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and multi-organ damage. A central factor in SLE pathogenesis is the excessive production of type I interferon (IFN-I), which drives immune dysregulation. Monocytes, key components of the immune system, significantly contribute to IFN-I production. However, their specific roles in SLE remain incompletely understood. Methods This study utilized bioinformatics and statistical analyses, including robust rank aggregation (RRA), DESeq2, and limma, to analyze transcriptome data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes of SLE patients and healthy controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were processed using the Seurat R package to identify and characterize monocyte subsets with a strong IFN-driven gene signature. Flow cytometry was employed to validate key findings, using markers such as CD14, SIGLEC1, and IRF7 to confirm monocyte subset composition. Results Our research has found that monocytes in SLE undergo IFN-driven transcriptional reprogramming, with the upregulation of key interferon signature genes (ISGs), forming the SLE-Related Monocyte Signature (SLERRAsignature). Moreover, the composition of mononuclear phagocyte subsets in SLE patients changes, with an increase trend in the proportion of the CD14Mono8 subset in the flare group. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 13 mononuclear phagocyte subsets of SLE are mainly ISGs, and the expression of ISGs is higher in severe patients. We identified SIGLEC1+IRF7+ monocytes among these subsets and for the first time discovered this group of cells in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. In SLE, the enrichment score of the gene set representing SIGLEC1+IRF7+ monocytes is positively correlated with the severity of SLE. Finally, flow cytometry confirmed that the frequency of CD14+SIGLEC1+IRF7+ monocytes in PBMCs was higher in SLE compared with healthy controls. Conclusions Our study found that the expansion of IFN-I-producing monocyte subsets, particularly the CD14+SIGLEC1+IRF7+ subset, plays a crucial role in SLE pathogenesis. This subset may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for managing SLE.

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to the emergence of viral variants with distinct characteristics. Understanding the differential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial for effective public health response and treatment development. We investigated the differential effects of the original Wuhan strain and the emergent Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 using a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. We compared the mortality rates, viral loads, and histopathological changes in lung and tracheal tissues, as well as alterations in the lung and intestinal microbiota following infection. Results Our findings revealed significant differences between the variants, with the Wuhan strain causing higher mortality rates, severe lung pathology, and elevated viral loads compared to the Omicron variant. Microbiome analyses uncovered novel and distinct shifts in the lung and intestinal microbiota associated with each variant, providing evidence for variant-specific microbiome alterations. These changes suggest microbiome-related mechanisms that might modulate disease severity and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions This study highlights critical differences between the Wuhan strain and Omicron variant in terms of mortality, lung pathology, and microbiota changes, emphasizing the role of the microbiome in influencing disease outcomes. Novel findings include the identification of variant-specific microbiota shifts, which underscore potential microbiome-related mechanisms underlying differences in disease severity. These insights pave the way for future research exploring microbiome-targeted interventions to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.

        <tr id="Background: Atherosclerosis is a progressive and complex vascular pathology characterized by cellular heterogeneity, metabolic dysregulation, and chronic inflammation. Despite extensive research, the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain incompletely understood. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to conduct a comprehensive mapping of immune cell enrichment and interactions within atherosclerotic plaques, aiming to investigate the cellular and molecular complexities of these structures. This approach facilitated a deeper understanding of the heterogeneities present in smooth muscle cells, which were subsequently analyzed using pseudotime trajectory analysis to monitor the developmental trajectories of smooth muscle cell (SMC) subpopulations. An integrative bioinformatics approach, primarily utilizing Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning techniques, identified Cathepsin C (CTSC), transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFBI), and glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG) as critical biomarkers. A diagnostic risk score model was developed and rigorously tested through Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. To illustrate the functional impact of CTSC on the regulation of plaque formation and SMC viability, both in vitro and in vivo experimental investigations were conducted. Results: An analysis revealed SMCs identified as the most prominent cellular type, exhibiting the highest density of disulfidptosis. Pseudotime trajectory analysis illuminated the dynamic activation pathways in SMCs, highlighting their significant role in plaque development and instability. Further characterization of macrophage subtypes demonstrated intercellular communication with SMCs, which exhibited specific signaling pathways, particularly between the proximal and core areas of plaques. The integrated diagnostic risk score model, which incorporates CTSC, TGFBI, and GMFG, proved to be highly accurate in distinguishing high-risk patients with elevated immune responses and systemic inflammation. Knockdown experiments of CTSC conducted in vitro revealed enhanced SMC survival rates, reduced oxidative stress, and inhibited apoptosis, while in vivo experiments confirmed a decrease in plaque burden and improvement in lipid profiles. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the significance of disulfidptosis in the development of atherosclerosis and identifies CTSC as a potential therapeutic target for stabilizing plaques by inhibiting SMC apoptosis and oxidative damage. Additionally, the risk score model serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying high-risk patients and guiding precision treatment strategies.">

 Respiratory viruses lead to severe mortality and morbidity worldwide. There is a continuous eruption of new and already existing viruses throughout the year. To understand the occurrence of co-infection of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to severity in patients. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was conducted on nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients infected with respiratory-like illness. The primers for two respiratory viruses, HMPV and SARS-CoV-2, were used for amplification. 9.9% of the samples were found to be infected with HMPV, and of these, 88.8% were also infected with SARS-CoV-2. The fluctuations in cytokine levels were also correlated, and it was found that interferon levels were low during mixed infection. We also report that while HMPV infection does not induce a hyperinflammatory effect, as a mixed infection with SARS-CoV-2, it could inhibit the adaptive immune responses due to reduced secretion of interferon-gamma, leading to insufficient sensitisation for B cells to produce antigen-specific response antibodies.">

        <tr id="Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) represent one of the most susceptible populations for developing severe COVID-19, and a unique human genetic condition for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility of neurologically vulnerable individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human Chromosome-21 (HSA21) triplication in DS causes global transcriptional deregulation, affecting multiple genes that may directly (e.g., TMPRSS2) or indirectly influence the SARS-CoV-2 entry into central nervous system (CNS) cells. The anti-viral immune response may also be altered in cells with trisomy-21 (T21) due to triplication of genes encoding for several interferon receptor subunits and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we demonstrate that human cells derived from fetal cortical specimens and maintained in primary cultures are susceptible to infection with a molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to express the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and to authentic SARS-CoV-2. The level of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cultures originated from different cortical specimens varied, seemingly depending on ploidy and chromosomal sex of the cells. We confirmed the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cultures and found that XY T21 group had the highest TMPRSS2 mRNA levels, which was associated with increased infectivity in XY—compared to XX T21 cultures. The XX T21 cultures exhibited elevated expression of several ISGs (MX1, STAT1, and STAT2) which was associated with lower infectivity. The comparisons of postmortem aged brain specimens revealed reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2, but elevated STAT2 protein levels in individuals with DS and Alzheimer’s disease (DS-AD) compared to control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) group. Collectively, these results suggest multifactorial regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cortical cells that involves ploidy, chromosomal sex, and the expression of genes implicated in regulation of virus entry and anti-viral response as contributing factors.

        <tr id="Respiratory viruses, including the influenza virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pose significant health threats. As tissue-resident macrophages, alveolar macrophages (AM) are crucial for defending against respiratory viral infection by producing cytokines, engulfing virus-infected cells, and promoting wound healing. However, excessive inflammatory responses can lead to tissue injury. Growing evidence indicates that astragaloside IV (AST IV) regulates innate immune responses. Specifically, AST IV balances the inflammatory response to mitigate tissue damage and promote tissue repair. However, whether AST IV directly targets AM to alleviate lung damage induced by respiratory viral infection remains unclear. Our results demonstrate that AST IV treatment significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in mice during IAV infection. AST IV markedly decreases proinflammatory cytokine levels, mitigates lung injury and promotes lung recovery through enhancing the repair capacity mediated by alveolar type II cells. Mechanistically, AST IV suppresses the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, which is critical for driving inflammatory responses in AM while maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Thus, our findings suggest that AST IV effectively targets AM to alleviate inflammation and lung damage caused by respiratory viral infections, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for managing viral pneumonia.

        <tr id="Background Vitiligo is an acquired skin depigmentation disorder often accompanied by leukoderma and leukotrichia. Half of vitiligo patients experience episodes of stress. Methods We established a chronic unpredictable mild stimulation (CUMS) model in C57BL/6 J mice to simulate chronic mental stress-induced leukoderma and leukotrichia. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to determine the immune landscape and to characterize the relationship between immune-stromal cells. Immunohistochemistry was employed for validation. Results We discovered a similar pro-inflammatory micro-environment composed of keratinocytes and fibroblasts similar to that in human vitiligo. Macrophages in CUMS mice expressed high levels of inflammatory factors and were inclined to an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. Two distinct clusters of melanocytes were also identified: Mel2, defined as melanocyte stem cells, and Mel3, defined as mature melanocytes. Mel2 cells were prone to pyroptosis and necroptosis, while Mel3 cells were susceptible to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. Compared with control mice, higher expression of CXCL16 on dendritic cells and of the CXCL16 ligand, CXCR6, on γδT cells were observed in leukoderma. Dendritic cells and natural killer T cells in the CUMS mouse spleen exhibited elevated levels of CXCL16 and CXCR6, respectively. Activation of the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis and a non-specific immune response in our CUMS model might imitate chronic mental stress-induced vitiligo in humans better than CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated models. Conclusions We discovered two melanocyte clusters with distinct fates and a pro-inflammatory micro-environment with CXCL16–CXCR6 axis activation of antigen-presenting cells and other innate immunocytes that might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of stress-induced vitiligo.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV- 2 continues to evolve, producing novel Omicron subvariants through recombinant lineages that acquire new mutations, undermining existing antiviral strategies. The viral fitness and adaptive potential of SARS-CoV- 2 present significant challenges to emergency treatments, particularly monoclonal antibodies, which demonstrate reduced efficacy with the emergence of each new variant. Consequently, immunocompromised individuals, who are more susceptible to severe manifestations of COVID- 19 and face heightened risks of critical complications and mortality, remain vulnerable in the absence of effective emergency treatments. To develop translational approaches that can benefit this at-risk population and establish broader therapeutic strategies applicable across variants, we previously designed and engineered in silico miniACE2 decoys (designated BP2, BP9, and BP11). These decoys demonstrated promising efficacy in neutralizing Omicron subvariants. In this study, we leveraged the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for tissue repair and immunomodulation in lung injuries and used these cells as a platform for the secretion of BP2. Our innovative assays, which were conducted with the BP2 protein secreted into the culture supernatant of BP2-MSCs, demonstrated the potential for neutralizing SARS-CoV- 2, including Omicron subvariants. The development of these advanced therapeutic platforms holds significant promise for scalability to effectively mitigate the impact of severe COVID- 19, contributing to broader and more resilient treatment strategies against the evolving landscape of SARS-CoV- 2 variants.

        <tr id="Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with new-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The overall goal of this study is to uncover how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD to inform the identification of at-risk patients and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Transcriptomics analysis of 43 PD pathogenic genes was conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID-19 patients with varying severity including 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU, and 17 ICU patients, compared to 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The study shows that COVID-19 severity gradient differentially dysregulates PD pathological genes. Dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients was identified as the convergent network of COVID-19—PD interactions. These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system in ICU COVID-19 patients. A potential synergistic co-expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes was observed in ICU patients, indicating a possible overlap in biological pathways. Dysregulation of the PD pathopharmacogene, SLC6A3 was observed in ICU patients, suggesting potential COVID-19-gene-drug interactions. Nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes, which could advance studies on PD, including diagnosis, pathogenesis, and the development of disease-modifying treatments. Outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients may face a higher risk of developing new-onset PD, whereas ICU COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19-gene-drug interactions.

Human immune system is highly vulnerable to lead, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Using single-cell mass cytometry and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we performed a panoramic survey of lead targets at both cellular and molecular levels in murine immune system upon chronic lead exposure. We produced a single-cell landscape of lead, thiol metabolism and lead-induced toxicity across all immune cell types. We found that immune cells with extreme thiol metabolism are the most sensitive upon chronic lead exposure. It shows that CD4 + T cells and neutrophils are the most sensitive to lead, which is due respectively to a molecular mechanism rooted in their characteristic thiol metabolic capacity. Meanwhile, we found that lead accumulation by RBC further inflicted secondary toxicity to RBC phagocytes in spleen, e.g. macrophages and neutrophils. Unlike CD4 + T cells, which can be rescued by supplementation with thiol chelator, lead toxicity in these phagocytes cannot be effectively mitigated by thiol chelators. Overall, it forms a multiscale panoramic lead-immune system interactome upon chronic lead exposure, which provides valuable information for proactive prevention, therapy formulation and public health evaluation.

        <tr id="Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by immune dysregulation, including altered innate lymphoid cell (ILC) immune responses, particularly during exacerbations (ECOPD). Baicalin, a natural compound prevalent in various herbal medicines, has shown promise as a therapeutic candidate in ECOPD. However, its potential and molecular mechanism for addressing ILC immune imbalance during ECOPD remain poorly understood. First, this study conducted a cross-sectional analysis of ILC immune responses in stable COPD patients and those experiencing exacerbations. Then, clinical findings of skewed ILC immunity were validated in cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide-induced ECOPD mouse models. Lastly, the therapeutic effect of baicalin on restoring ILC immune homeostasis was investigated in experimental ECOPD mouse models. Significant downregulation of ILC2 immunity was observed during COPD exacerbations, accompanied by increased ILC1 and ILC3 responses, particularly in cases associated with bacterial infections. Notably, elevated IL-22 levels were observed in this group. Administration of recombinant IL-22 in ECOPD mouse models disrupted lung ILC homeostasis, specifically inhibiting the accumulation of ILC2. Proteomics and transcriptomics analyses suggested IL-22 as a mediator of type 2 immune suppression by creating a molecular environment that favors type 1 and type 3 immunity. Treatment with baicalin effectively restored ILC2 immunity by enhancing the recruitment and activation of lung ILC2 while suppressing ILC1 and ILC3 responses. Importantly, baicalin attenuated IL-22 production from lung ILC3, highlighting its potential as an IL-22 inhibitor. Baicalin demonstrates potential as a therapeutic strategy for addressing ILC immune imbalance in COPD exacerbations, particularly by restoring ILC2 immunity and partially inhibiting IL-22 production.

The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, but chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and viral persistence are increasingly being implicated. This study investigated the immunopathological drivers of long COVID-19 and their associations with clinical manifestations and organ damage. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 200 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-65 years, in which immune markers, autoantibody profiles, lymphocyte dysfunction, and imaging findings were assessed over a 12-month period. Persistent inflammation was observed, with elevated interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α ± levels correlated with lung fibrosis and cognitive impairment. Autoantibodies were detected in 40% of the participants, particularly those with cardiovascular and neurological symptoms. A significant reduction in CD8+ T-cell counts was associated with severe fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, whereas persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in 10% of cases, primarily in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms. Imaging studies revealed multiorgan involvement, with structural abnormalities in the lungs, heart, and brain. These findings highlight the interplay of immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity in long-term COVID-19, underscoring the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to address its long-term health impacts.">

        <tr id="Asthma, a chronic airway disease, is marked by allergic inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and tissue remodeling. Influenza infections in asthma patients can cause severe exacerbations, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated how pre-existing allergic inflammation affects immune responses to influenza infection in mice exposed to house dust mite (HDM). Mice were repeatedly exposed to HDM, followed by infection with the influenza A virus, and were sacrificed three days post-infection. Plasma was analyzed for HDM-specific immunoglobulins, while lung tissue was used for immune cell flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analysis. HDM exposure induced allergic inflammation, evidenced by more HDM-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2, eosinophils, neutrophils, Th1, and Th17 cells compared to controls. Upon influenza infection, the effects of HDM and influenza co-infection interacted, showing fewer Th1 cells and regulatory T cells and more Th2 cells compared to mice exposed to the influenza virus alone. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed less upregulation of Th1-related genes and antiviral pathways in co-exposed mice, suggesting impaired Th1 immunity and antiviral responses. Pre-existing allergic inflammation significantly altered immune responses in mice co-infected with influenza, revealing underdeveloped antiviral responses as early as three days post-infection. These findings may explain the increased susceptibility of patients with asthma to severe viral diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction There are significant challenges remain in accurately categorizing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients. Objectives We used an untargeted 1H NMR-based metabolomics to assess the metabolomic changes in serum samples from a Danish cohort of 106 COVID-19-infected patients with mild to fatal disease courses and from patients with fatal outcomes from other diseases. Methods In total, 240 serum samples were used for this study. We used the data for multiple analyses (1) to construct a predictive model for disease severity and outcome, (2) to identify prognostic markers for subsequent disease severity and outcome, and (3) to understand the disease consequences in the metabolome and how recovery or death is reflected in the altered biological pathways. Results Our results revealed distinct alterations in the serum metabolome that could differentiate patients with COVID-19 by severity (mild or severe) or outcome (death or survival). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and four machine learning algorithms (random forest, linear support vector machine, PLS-DA, and logistic regression), we identified two biomarker sets with relevant biological functions that predict subsequent disease severity and patient outcome. The range of these severity-associated biomarkers was equally broad and included inflammatory markers, amino acids, fluid balance, ketone bodies, glycolysis-related metabolites, lipoprotein particles, and fatty acid levels. Conclusions Our data suggest the potential benefits of broader testing of these metabolites from newly diagnosed patients to predict which COVID-19 patients will progress to severe disease and which patients will manifest severe symptoms to minimize mortality.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 variants present diverse clinical manifestations, necessitating deeper insights into their pathogenic effects. This study employs multi-omics approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on vascular damage. Plasma proteomic analysis of unvaccinated participants infected with Omicron BA.2.76 or ancestral variants identifies key signaling pathways associated with endothelial dysfunction, with the vinculin (VCL) pathway emerging as a hallmark of Omicron infections, contributing to lung exudation. Metabolomic analysis of plasma samples from the same cohort reveals disruptions in immune function, cell membrane integrity, and metabolic processes, including altered tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis pathways. An integrated analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data underscores the role of VCL in inflammation and extravasation, highlighting its interactions with adhesion molecules and inflammatory metabolites. A validation cohort of plasma samples from Omicron-infected participants confirms this association by replicating proteomic analysis, showing elevated VCL levels correlated with inflammatory markers. Functional studies in a male rat model of lung injury demonstrate that anti-VCL intervention reduces plasma VCL levels, mitigates alveolar edema, and restores alveolar-capillary barrier integrity, as assessed by histological staining and electron microscopy, thereby illustrating VCL modulation’s impact on vascular leakage and extravasation. These findings establish VCL as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating vascular complications in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="The rapid worldwide transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to severe cases of hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and ultimately death. Small-scale molecular interactions have been analyzed by focusing on several genes/single genes, providing important insights; however, genome-wide multi-omics comprehensive molecular interactions have not yet been well investigated with the exception of GWAS and eQTLm, both of which show genetic risks. From April of 2020 until now, we have created a Japan-wide system, initially named the Japan COVID-19 Task Force. This system has collected more than 6500 COVID-19 patients’ peripheral blood and as much associated clinical information as possible from a network of more than 120 hospitals. DNA, RNA, serum, and plasma were extracted and stored in this bank. This study unravels the interplay of inflammatory gene networks that induce different COVID-19 severity levels (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) by using multi-omics data from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force. We analyze RNA and protein expressions to estimate severity-specific inflammation networks that uncover the interplay between RNA and protein networks via ligand–receptor pairs. Our large-scale RNA/protein expression data analysis reveals that the atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2) acts as a key broker linking RNA and protein inflammation networks to induce COVID-19 critical severity. ACKR2 emerges in RNA and protein inflammation networks, showing active interplay in high-severity cases and weak interactions in mild cases. The results also show severity-specific molecular interactions between interleukin (IL), cytokine receptor activity, cell adhesion, and interactions involving the CC chemokine ligand (CCL) gene family and ACKR2.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated a global pandemic resulting in an estimated 775 million infections with over 7 million deaths, it has become evident that COVID-19 is not solely a pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence has shown that, in a subset of patients, certain symptoms − including chest pain, stroke, anosmia, dysgeusia, diarrhea and abdominal pain – all indicate a role of vascular, neurological and gastrointestinal (GI) pathology in the disease process. Many of these disease processes persist long after the acute disease has been resolved, resulting in ‘long COVID’ or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The molecular mechanisms underlying the acute and systemic conditions associated with COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Appropriate animal models provide a method of understanding underlying disease mechanisms at the system level through the study of disease progression, tissue pathology, immune system response to the pathogen and behavioral responses. However, very few studies have addressed PASC and whether existing models hold promise for studying this challenging problem. Here, we review the current literature on cardiovascular, neurological and GI pathobiology caused by COVID-19 in patients, along with established animal models of the acute disease manifestations and their prospects for use in PASC studies. Our aim is to provide guidance for the selection of appropriate models in order to recapitulate certain aspects of the disease to enhance the translatability of mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Objective. The aim was to evaluate specific T-cell and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in children hospitalized with respiratory infectious diseases.Materials and methods. Examination of 121 children was carried out in 2021–2024. Among them 22% of patients were under 1 year of age, 33% — 1–3 years, 21% 4–6 years, 24% 7–14 years. In 51 children acute respiratory infection was concomitant with the course of pertussis. Diagnosis of acute respiratory viral infections was based on clinical data and on PCR testing of nasopharyngeal mucus including PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Using a method we developed, memory T cells specific to the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein were assessed in patients' blood. IgG- and IgM-antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein in blood serum were also tested.Results. IgG antibodies to S-glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the blood of 55% of children in 2021, 65% in 2022, 82% in 2023, and 96% in 2024. T lymphocytes activated by stimulation with recombinant S-glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the blood of 25% of children in 2021, 70% in 2022 and 19–35% in 2023–2024. A significant (55%) frequency of serologic markers of transmitted undiagnosed COVID-19 was found in children under 3 years of age whose contacts, especially in 2021, were limited to family. In the groups of patients 3–14 years old, even more children were seropositive (95–100%). Memory T cells were found less frequently in children younger 3 years than after 3 years of age.Conclusion. Examination of individuals with various respiratory diseases can clarify ideas about what part of the population has acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2, as well as assess the role of memory T cells and antibodies to “ancestral” and current strains of SARS-CoV-2 in limiting morbidity.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 776 million confirmed cases and more than 7 million deaths worldwide. In addition to humans, various animal species have exhibited natural infections, with mink being the only farmed animals consistently linked to severe illness and zoonotic transmission to humans. This study investigates histological pulmonary lesions in Danish farm mink infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), focusing on groups with different clinical signs and outcomes. Results Histopathological evaluations revealed lesions in SARS-CoV-2-positive mink with and without clinical signs of disease. The main findings in lungs from SARS-CoV-2-positive mink in all study groups were extensive respiratory epithelial damage, acute diffuse alveolar damage, and vascular lesions, including the formation of thrombi. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of viral particles primarily in the respiratory epithelia. Lymphoid cells exhibited nodular and perivascular aggregates similar to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in older SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected mink, indicating a potential age-related feature of mink lungs. Conclusions The presence of subclinical and long-term pulmonary lesions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in farm mink suggests that the impact of outbreaks may be more serious than clinical signs records indicate. The current SARS-CoV-2 surveillance system on Danish mink farms does not properly address such problems and repeated outbreaks on farms could occur without detection if there are no clinical signs or increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2. The severity of subclinical lesions reveals hidden health and welfare challenges in mink, underscoring the need for improved prevention measures, surveillance and understanding of long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mink.

        <tr id="Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection poses a global public health challenge, especially in infants and young children, with severe cases leading to fatal consequences. EV71 infection modulates various biological processes of the host and evades host immunity through multiple mechanisms. The balance of mitochondrial dynamics is important for cellular homeostasis. However, the mechanisms underlying EV71‐induced cellular damage via mitophagy remain unclear. In the current study, we showed that EV71 infection significantly reduced the total and mitochondrial ATP contents in cells, as well as the expression of mitochondrial proteins TOM20 and TIM23. Then, EV71 infection increased the protein levels of PINK1, Parkin, and LC3B, suggesting that EV71 infection triggers the mitophagy. Silencing PINK1 caused a significant reduction in viral replication, while overexpressing Parkin promoted the replication of EV71. Moreover, CsA treatment, as a mitophagy inhibitor, alleviated pathological damage and suppressed the replication of EV71 in vivo. Mechanistic study showed that silencing PINK1 inhibited the cleavage of MAVS by EV71, while overexpressing Parkin enhanced the cleavage of MAVS by EV71, suggesting that PINK1‐mediated mitophagy was involved in regulating innate immunity. Furthermore, we found that EV71 infection promoted the release of mitochondria carrying EV71 virions into the extracellular environment, which mediated infection of other cells, thus facilitating virus spreading. In addition, we also demonstrated that the extracellular mitochondria induced the degradation of MAVS and mitophagy promoted the release of mitochondria in EV71‐infected HeLa cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that EV71 infection induces PINK1‐mediated mitophagy, which inhibits innate immunity and facilitates virus replication.">

This long prodrome is suggestive of peripheral immunity involvement in the initiation of disease. We previously developed a model system in PINK1 KO mice displaying PD-like motor symptoms at late stages following intestinal infections. Herein, we map the initiating immune events at the site of infection in this model. Using single-cell RNAseq, we demonstrate that peripheral myeloid cells are the earliest highly dysregulated immune cell type followed by an aberrant T cell response shortly after. We also demonstrate an increased propensity for antigen presentation and that activated myeloid cells acquire a proinflammatory profile capable of inducing cytotoxic T cell responses. Together, our study provides the first evidence that PINK1 is a key regulator of immune functions in the gut underlying early PD-related disease mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to persistent or newly emerging symptoms lasting for months, a condition known as long COVID (LC). The pathophysiology of LC remains poorly understood, with cytokine dysregulation proposed as a key mechanism, although findings across the studies have been inconsistent. Patients and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study using the Olink® Target 96 Inflammation Panel to assess cytokines in COVID-19 (COV) patients at three months and six months post-infection. These profiles were compared with those of individuals recovering from other upper respiratory tract infections (non-COV). Additionally, we analyzed differences between individuals with LC and those who recovered from COVID-19. Predictive models for LC at three months and sixth months post-infection were developed using inflammatory markers and relevant clinical cofactors, including gender, age, BMI, hemogram, Β2-microglobulin, D-dimers, LDH, AST, ALT, Ferritin, vitamin D, CRP, and the severity of acute COVID-19 infection as classified by WHO criteria. Results: We observed a general decline in inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients over time, with only a few cytokines elevated (CCL4 at month 3 and CST5 at month 6) compared to non-COV controls. In LC patients, an early phase of low-grade inflammation transitioned into significant reduction in proinflammatory biomarkers compared to recovered individuals. Rather than indicating immune normalization, this pattern suggests a possible suppression or exhaustion of the immune response in the months following acute infection. Importantly, our predictive modeling demonstrated that this specific cytokine signature, in combination with acute disease severity and clinical cofactors, described well the presence of LC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inflammation-related biomarker dysregulation following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection evolves dynamically over a six-month period. By the sixth month, compared to the third month, the presence of LC is more accurately predicted by a combination of persistent biomarker alteration and the severity of the initial infection, as defined by WHO criteria. This represents a novel insight, as previous studies have primarily associated LC with elevated proinflammatory markers, whereas our results suggest that immune suppression or exhaustion may play a more prominent role in the later stages.">

        <tr id="Although the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the emergence of the post-COVID-19 condition presents a new and complex public health challenge, characterized by persistent, multisystem symptoms that can endure for weeks or months after the initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, significantly affecting survivors’ quality of life. Among the most concerning sequelae are cardiovascular complications, which encompass a broad spectrum of conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial damage, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This narrative review explores the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular health by reviewing the latest and most relevant findings in the literature and highlighting different aspects of COVID-19’s cardiovascular involvement. This review investigates the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular involvement in the post-COVID-19 condition, with a focus on direct viral invasion via ACE2 receptors, immune-mediated cardiovascular injury, cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and mitochondrial injury. The interplay between pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, and COVID-19 is also explored, revealing that individuals with such conditions are at heightened risk for both severe acute illness and long-term complications. Long-term immune activation and the persistence of viral antigens are increasingly recognized as contributors to ongoing cardiovascular damage, even in individuals with mild or asymptomatic initial infections. As the healthcare system continues to adapt to the long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a deeper understanding of these cardiovascular manifestations is essential. This knowledge will inform the development of targeted strategies for prevention, clinical management, and rehabilitation of affected patients. Furthermore, the insights gained from the intersection of COVID-19 and cardiovascular health will be instrumental in shaping responses to future viral epidemics, highlighting the necessity for multidisciplinary approaches to patient care and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="Metabolites, particularly those derived from gut microbiota, play crucial roles in modulating immune responses, but the impact of most metabolites on immune cells remains unexplored. To systematically investigate the effect of metabolites on immune cells, we treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with 364 endogenous and gut microbiota metabolites and analyzed their impact on the PBMC transcriptome using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Clustering analysis revealed three distinct metabolite groups (Cluster 0, 1, 2), each exerting unique immunomodulatory effects. Cluster 1 metabolites, enhanced inflammatory pathways (e.g., cytokine signaling, neutrophil migration) and suppressed ferroptosis, potentially prolonging immune cell activity. In contrast, Cluster 0 metabolites promoted antigen presentation and extracellular matrix repair, while Cluster 2 metabolites upregulated autophagy-related pathways (e.g., GTPase signaling, ubiquitin-protein regulation), suggesting anti-inflammatory and tissue-homeostatic functions. Immune deconvolution highlighted Cluster 1-driven monocyte-to-M0 macrophage differentiation and elevated activated dendritic/mast cells, aligning with pro-inflammatory outcomes. Metabolites in Clusters 0/2 were enriched in the TCA cycle and alanine/aspartate metabolism, whereas Cluster 1 metabolites correlated with beta-alanine and branched-chain amino acid pathways. Gut microbiota analysis identified 23 species overrepresented in Cluster 1, linking dysbiosis to inflammatory metabolite profiles. Together, this high-throughput atlas elucidates how bloodborne metabolites shape PBMC function, offering insights into metabolic-immune crosstalk and potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.">

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) offer a convenient and comprehensive snapshot of the body's immune status. In this study, we performed an integrated analysis of PBMCs using both bulk-cell and single-cell RNA-seq data, spanning from children to frail elderlies, to investigate age-related changes. We observed dynamic changes in the PBMC transcriptome during healthy aging, including dramatic shifts in inflammation, myeloid cells, and lymphocyte features during early life, followed by relative stability in later stages. Conversely, frail elderly individuals exhibited notable disruptions in peripheral immune cells, including an increased senescent phenotype in monocytes with elevated inflammatory cytokine expression, heightened effector activation in regulatory T cells, and functional impairment of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of immunosenescence, elucidating the mechanisms driving abnormal inflammation and immunosuppression in frailty.">

        <tr id="Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), professional type I interferon (IFN) producing cells, have been implicated in host responses against bacterial infections. However, their role in host defense is debated and the operating molecular mechanisms are unknown. Certain Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule Family (SLAMF) members act as microbial sensors and modulate immune functions in response to infection. Here by analyzing multiple human blood transcriptomic datasets, we report the involvement of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in many infectious diseases, with elevated levels associated with type I IFN responses in salmonellosis and brucellosis patients. We further identify SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 as key regulators of human pDC function. Silencing of these receptors hinders pDC maturation and abrogates cytokine production during infection with acute (Salmonella) or chronic (Brucella) inflammation-inducing bacteria. Mechanistically, we show that SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 signal through NF-κB, IRF7 and STAT-1, and limit mitochondrial ROS accumulation upon Salmonella infection. This SLAMF7/8-dependent control of mitochondrial ROS levels favors bacterial persistence and NF-κB activation. Overall, our results unravel essential shared roles of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in finely tuning human pDC responses to intracellular bacterial infections with high diagnosis and therapeutic perspectives.">

        <tr id="Background Defining the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is critical for informing the management of reinfections, vaccinations, and therapeutics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Using four antibody assays, we evaluated antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and receptor binding domain (RBD) in 98 convalescent participants with varying COVID-19 disease severities (asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe) at 1, 3, 6, and 12-months post-SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR and in 17 non-vaccinated, non-infected controls. Results Increasing acute COVID-19 disease severity correlates with higher anti-N and anti-RBD titers throughout 12 months post-infection. Anti-N and anti-RBD titers decline over time in all participants, except for increased anti-RBD titers post-vaccination, with hospitalized participants exhibiting faster decay rates. Less than 50% of participants retain anti-N titers above controls at 12 months, with non-hospitalized participants falling below controls sooner. Nearly all participants maintain anti-RBD titers above controls for 12 months, suggesting long-term protection against severe reinfections. Nonetheless, by 6 months, few participants retain >50% of their initial 1-month anti-N or anti-RBD titers. Notably, vaccine-induced anti-RBD titers are higher in non-hospitalized participants. Lastly, early convalescent titers correlate with age but not with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) status or steroid use. Conclusion Hospitalized participants initially develop higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers that decline faster relative to non-hospitalized participants. While anti-N titers fall below control levels in some participants, anti-RBD titers remain above controls over 12 months, demonstrating long-lived antibody responses known to protect against severe disease. These findings advance our understanding of COVID-19 antibody dynamics.">

        <tr id="Life-threatening severe dengue (SD) develops in a small subset of patients suffering from dengue fever (DF), a febrile disease that develops following infection with dengue virus (DENV). DENV is a mosquito-borne positive -sense RNA virus. The rapid spread of DENV vectors, which was exacerbated by climate change and inadequate control measures, has led to outbreaks affecting millions worldwide. There is no specific treatment for DF, and the recently introduced vaccines are ineffective in containing the current outbreaks. Like many other viral diseases, the immune system plays a key role in dengue pathogenesis. The lack of models replicating the disease’s immunopathological features has hampered the understanding of the immune system’s role in developing this disease. Recent advances, such as single-cell approaches, provide better systems and methodologies to study the role of different immune cells in SD, closing this gap and providing a better mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis and promoting the identification of targets for therapeutic interventions. Here, we summarize recent advances in SD research, focusing on immune cell interactions and their role in disease severity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) pathology involves complex immune responses within granulomatous lesions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cellular compositions of necrotizing granulomatous lesions that developed in the lungs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice. We identified 11 distinct major cell types, including phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, and T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Among T cells, particularly, Pdcd1⁺ γδ T cells were detected in necrotizing granulomatous lesions, suggesting their potential role in the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. Within the macrophage populations, we identified a cluster with significantly higher Plin2 expression compared to other clusters, whose transcriptomic profile was consistent with that of foamy macrophages. A subset of the Plin2-expressing macrophages was identified as a major source of Ifnb1 and Cxcl1, suggesting their involvement in type I interferon signaling and neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, we identified Flrt2, Hyal1, and Mmp13 as novel molecular markers of Plin2-expressing macrophages, which were localized to the peripheral rim regions of necrotizing granulomas. In conclusion, our results provide the immune landscape of necrotizing granulomas and reveal novel functional states of macrophages contributing to TB pathogenesis.">

 Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ended, the enduring health impacts of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continue to garner global attention, as approximately 10% of patients develop long COVID (post COVID-19 condition). The epidemiological characteristics and symptoms of long COVID have been reported, and various pathogenic hypotheses have been proposed. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids or fragments persist in some patients post-infection and that these are correlated with long COVID symptoms. This review focuses on clinical studies linking SARS-CoV-2 persistence to long COVID symptoms, and explores the relationship between viral persistence and other etiological hypotheses, such as immune dysregulation, vascular issues, coagulation dysfunction, microbiome dysbiosis, brainstem/vagus nerve signaling dysfunction, and latent virus reactivation. Futhermore, treatment strategies for long COVID are proposed based on current clinical trials of antiviral and immune modulation therapies. Understanding the role of viral persistence in long COVID pathogenesis is critical for developing targeted therapies and improving clinical management of this debilitating condition.

We longitudinally sampled the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had active liver inflammation and were starting antiviral therapy. Antiviral therapy suppressed viral replication and liver inflammation, which coincided with decreased myeloid activation markers. Single-cell RNA-Seq mapped peripheral inflammatory markers to a monocyte-derived macrophage population, distinct from Kupffer cells, with an inflammatory transcriptional profile. The inflammatory macrophages (iMacs) differentiated from blood monocytes and were unique from macrophage found in healthy or cirrhotic liver. iMacs retained their core transcriptional signature after inflammation resolved, indicating inflammation-mediated remodeling of the macrophage population in the human liver that may affect progressive liver disease and immunotherapy.">

However, the role of NK cell-mediated ADCC in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, particularly whether it limits viral spread and disease severity or contributes to the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. We hypothesized that the high-affinity CD16AV176 polymorphism influences these outcomes. Using a novel in vitro reporter system, we demonstrated that CD16AV176 is a more potent and sensitive activator than the common CD16AF176 allele. To assess its clinical relevance, we analyzed 1,027 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC), a comprehensive longitudinal dataset with extensive transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data. The high-affinity CD16AV176 allele was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and severe disease trajectories. Lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers were correlated to CD16AV176; however, there was no difference in viral load across CD16 genotypes. Proteomic analysis revealed that participants homozygous for CD16AV176 had lower levels of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that CD16AV176 enhances early NK cell-mediated immune responses, limiting severe respiratory complications in COVID-19. This study identifies a protective genetic factor against severe COVID-19, informing future host-directed therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="West Nile virus (WNV), a globally distributed flavivirus, poses a significant public health threat, causing West Nile fever and potentially severe neuroinvasive disease in humans. The absence of specific antiviral treatments and licenced human vaccines underscores the importance of understanding WNV pathogenesis, particularly the mechanisms by which it evades host immune responses. This review comprehensively analyzes the multifaceted immune evasion strategies employed by WNV, encompassing the suppression of interferon (IFN) production and signalling through targeting of STAT proteins, IRF3, and RNA sensors, the modulation of antigen presentation via downregulation of MHC molecules and impairment of proteasome function, and the manipulation of cytokine and chemokine responses to dysregulate inflammation and promote viral persistence. Furthermore, WNV exploits the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to gain access to the central nervous system (CNS), both by disrupting the barrier integrity and utilising “Trojan horse” mechanisms. The potential for antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) further complicates the host‐virus interaction. Understanding these immune evasion mechanisms is crucial for deciphering WNV pathogenesis and informing the development of effective vaccines and targeted immunotherapies aimed at preventing and treating WNV‐related diseases. Future research should focus on translating this knowledge into tangible clinical benefits for at‐risk populations, particularly regarding strategies to induce broadly neutralising antibody responses and robust T‐cell immunity while mitigating the risk of ADE.">

        <tr id="The role of immune metabolism, specific metabolites and cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic metabolic states across the time course of an inflammatory response are emerging knowledge. Targeted and untargeted metabolomic analysis is essential to understand how immune cells adapt their metabolic program throughout an immune response. In addition, metabolomic analysis can aid to identify pathophysiological patterns in inflammatory disease. Here, we discuss new metabolomic findings within the transition from inflammation to resolution, focusing on three key programs of immunity: Efferocytosis, IL-10 signaling and trained immunity. Particularly the tryptophan-derived metabolite kynurenine was identified as essential for efferocytosis and inflammation resolution as well as a potential biomarker in diverse inflammatory conditions. In summary, metabolomic analysis and integration with transcriptomic and proteomic data, high resolution imaging and spatial information is key to unravel metabolic drivers and dependencies during inflammation and progression to tissue-repair.">

        <tr id="Introduction The H9N2 avian influenza virus, although not highly pathogenic, still poses ongoing risks to poultry health and food security due to its ability to resist vaccines and its potential to spread to humans. Methods This study investigated the effects of baicalin, a flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, on respiratory mucosal immunity during H9N2 infection. In vitro experiments were conducted using MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells, and in vivo evaluations were performed in a mouse model of H9N2 infection. Results Baicalin treatment enhanced the expression of antiviral proteins Mx1 and PKR in a dose- and time-dependent manner, helping to counteract the virus’s suppression of these defense proteins. In addition to strengthening this epithelial barrier, baicalin has both antiviral and immune-regulating effects: it directly blocks viral replication and helps restore the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in H9N2-infected mice. Most importantly, baicalin reduces lung damage and spleen shrinkage while keeping the immune system balanced. These results show that baicalin enhances mucosal antiviral defenses by simultaneously regulating innate antiviral pathways (Mx1 and PKR) and restoring adaptive immune balance (CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio). Discussion These dual protective effects highlight baicalin’s potential as a natural therapeutic strategy for improving mucosal immunity against vaccine-resistant influenza viruses such as H9N2, contributing valuable insights into plant-derived immunomodulatory approaches against emerging zoonotic viral threats.">

        <tr id="Background Neuropathological and clinical studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may increase the long-term risk of neurodegeneration. Methods We provide a narrative overview of pathological and clinical observations justifying the implementation of a surveillance program to monitor changes in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the years after COVID-19. Results Autopsy studies revealed diverse changes in the brain, including loss of vascular integrity, microthromboses, gliosis, demyelination, and neuronal- and glial injury and cell death, in both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals irrespective of the severity of COVID-19. Recent data suggest that microglia play an important role in sustained COVID-19-related inflammation, which contributes to the etiology initiating a neurodegenerative cascade, to the worsening of pre-existing neurodegenerative disease or to the acceleration of neurodegenerative processes. Histopathological data have been supported by neuroimaging, and epidemiological studies also suggested a higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases after COVID-19. Conclusions Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 during the pandemic, healthcare systems should be aware of, and be prepared for a potential increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the upcoming years. Strategies may include follow-up of well-described cohorts, analyses of outcomes in COVID-19-registries, nationwide surveillance programs using record-linkage of ICD-10 diagnoses, and comparing the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the post-pandemic periods to values of the pre-pandemic years. Awareness and active surveillance are particularly needed, because diverse clinical manifestations due to earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may no longer be quoted as post-COVID-19 symptoms, and hence, increasing incidence of neurodegenerative pathologies at the community level may remain unnoticed.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Long-term immunosuppressive therapy typically increases the risk of viral infection, yet during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients showed reduced severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility. This suggests potential overlapping molecular mechanisms between IBD and COVID-19 that warrant investigation.


METHODS
From April 2020 to April 2022, we enrolled 363 IBD patients and 146 healthy donors. Serum samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunoadsorption assay to determine the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and to measure concentrations of the host-soluble factors sACE2 and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which have SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity. Furthermore, colonic mucosa biopsies were analyzed by real-time PCR to confirm the upregulation of MBL2 as well as to assess the expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules (ie, ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, ADAM17, AGTR1).


RESULTS
Intestinal mucosa expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4 genes was significantly lower in IBD than in healthy individuals, regardless of the type of medication, while ADAM17 and AGT1R were similar across groups. Serum sACE2 levels changed minimally, whereas circulating MBL levels were significantly higher in CD and somewhat elevated in UC patients versus controls. Parallel trends in MBL2 gene expression were observed in IBD patients' intestinal mucosa.


CONCLUSIONS
Overall, our study indicates that the presence of higher basal circulating levels of MBL in CD patients and the decreased intestinal mucosa expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the host cell priming proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in both CD and UC patients may reduce COVID-19 risk, underscoring the potential protective role of these biomarkers in IBD populations against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized not only for its acute effects but also for its ability to cause LongCOVID Syndrome (LCS), a condition characterized by persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus’ ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1α activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting autophagy and Nrf2 activation, glycolysis inhibition, and restoration calcium homeostasis may provide novel strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future research should focus on personalized therapeutic interventions based on the dominant molecular perturbations in individual patients.">

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which
causes COVID-19, causes damage to many organ systems because of the presence of receptor Angiotensin-
Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) in widespread tissues. Its pathogenesis includes viral reproduction,
immunopathy, oxidative damage, and pathological cytokine activities, which all contribute
to its high morbidity and mortality rates. While there are no specific antiviral drugs, preclinical
studies have found ginger to be effective in alleviating inflammation, oxidative stress, and viral
infections. Research indicates that ginger could help improve the inflammatory and oxidative stress
induced by SARS-CoV-2, thus supporting the treatment of COVID-19. The present review reveals
the clinical significance of ginger towards COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy and discusses the therapeutic
potential of ginger during the COVID-19 pandemic by merging traditional medicine, molecular
and in-vitro studies, and clinical studies.

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the secondary bacterial infection further exacerbates the severity and fatality of the initial viral infection. Mitophagy plays an important role in host resistance to pathogen infection and immune response, while its role on pulmonary epithelial cells with viral and bacterial co-infection remains unclear. The present study reveals that the secondary Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly increased the viral and bacterial loads in human lung epithelial cells (A549) during the initial H1N1 infection. Meanwhile, the secondary S. aureus infection triggered more intense mitophagy in A549 cells by activating the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway. Notably, mitophagy could contribute to the proliferation of pathogens in A549 cells via the inhibition of cell apoptosis. Furthermore, based on an influenza A viral and secondary bacterial infected mouse model, we showed that activation of mitophagy was conducive to the proliferation of virus and bacteria in the lungs, aggravated the inflammatory damage and severe pneumonia at the same time, and eventually decreased the survival rate. The results elucidated the effect and the related molecular mechanism of mitophagy in pulmonary epithelial cells following IAV and secondary S. aureus infection for the first time, which will provide valuable information for the pathogenesis of virus/bacteria interaction and new ideas for the treatment of severe pneumonia.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the release of interferons (IFNs) and the proinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases. STAT3, a key protein in this pathway, has been implicated in promoting inflammation, making its inhibition a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles (MSC-EVs), enriched with immunomodulatory and antiviral miRNAs, offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating gene expression and regulating inflammatory responses. This study investigates the ability of Lyophilized MSC-EVs to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, highlighting their potential application in COVID-19 management.


METHODS
Male Syrian hamsters were used as an experimental model, housed under controlled laboratory conditions. SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020) was propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titers were determined using plaque assays. Hamsters were intranasally challenged with the virus and treated intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of lyophilized human Wharton's jelly-derived MSC-extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Histopathological evaluations were performed on lung tissues using H&E, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining. Morphometric analyses were conducted to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Western blotting was employed to evaluate protein expression. All procedures adhered to ethical and biosafety guidelines.


RESULTS
The administration of MSC-EVs significantly upregulated the expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-124, miRNA-155, miRNA-29b, miRNA-7, miRNA-145 and miRNA-18a compared to their levels in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a targeted release of miRNA-cargo from the MSC-EVs into the lung tissue of the animals. MSC-EVs impaired the activation of the STAT3/STAT1 signaling pathway and reduced the cytokine storm and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that MSC-EVs have the potential to effectively mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs and their clinical application in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation is an important component of the complex pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the entry receptor and key to the alternative RAS, was proposed as a severity/prognostic biomarker for risk-stratification. However, experimental RAS data from diverse cohorts are limited, particularly analyses integrating RAS with immune biomarkers. Participants (n = 172) in Cape Town were sampled longitudinally (including a recovery timepoint [> 3-month]), across WHO asymptomatic to critical severity. Using fluorometric assays and LC-MS/MS RAS Fingerprinting®, results show serum ACE1 activity significantly decreases with increasing COVID-19 severity (P < 0.01) and mortality (P < 0.05), while increased ACE2 activity is associated with worse severity (P < 0.01). Neither enzyme activity correlates with viral load proxy or nasal ACE mRNA levels. ACE1 and ACE2 activities were the most effective severity biomarkers compared to 96 established immune markers obtained via proximity extension assay, as demonstrated by principal component analysis. A multivariate variable selection model using random forest classification identified biomarkers discriminating COVID-19 severity (AUC = 0.82), the strongest being HGF, EN-RAGE, cathepsin L. Adding ACE1 activity and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres improved differentiation between ambulatory and hospitalised participants. Notably, RAS dysregulation has unique severity associations in coronavirus infections with implications for treatment and pathophysiological mechanisms.

        <tr id="Bacterial meningitis (BM) requires rapid intervention, especially in immunocompromised populations. Understanding early immune responses is crucial, as they precede clinical symptoms; however, comprehensive studies remain limited. This research investigates immune-related genes to improve BM diagnosis and treatment. Mendelian randomization, differential gene expression analysis, and co-expression network analysis identified key genes associated with BM. Immune cell ratio calculations and infiltration analyses demonstrated altered immune cell proportions. Spearman correlation analysis revealed relationships between gene expression and immune cell types. Single-cell RNA sequencing, gene set enrichment analysis, and pseudotime analysis explored changes in gene expression and cell proportions across disease stages, focusing on the roles of key genes in specific immune cells. Ring Finger Protein 144B (RNF144B) was identified as a risk gene predominantly expressed in monocytes and neutrophils. Conversely, FYN Proto-Oncogene (FYN) was identified as a protective gene primarily associated with NKT cells. During BM onset, increased RNF144B expression positively correlated with elevated neutrophil levels, while reduced FYN expression correlated with decreased NKT cell levels. During remission and recovery, RNF144B expression and neutrophil proportions decreased, whereas FYN expression and NKT cell proportions increased. NKT cells appeared to play a protective role, with FYN potentially modulating T-cell receptor function in these cells, thereby reducing BM risk. RNF144B and FYN expression exhibit opposing trends in peripheral blood across BM stages, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring.

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has impacted the health of millions globally, with many individuals experiencing persistent symptoms even after testing negative, a condition known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or long COVID. This study analyzes demographic influences on the severity and duration of PASC symptoms, with an emphasis on physiological and cognitive effects. Using a self-reporting survey method, data were collected from a sample of 110 participants and analyzed using statistical methods such as exploratory factor analysis, Pearson correlation, and two-factor analysis of variance. The participants were primarily based in California, and a majority of them were ethnically Asian. The study found that females generally reported higher severity of cognitive and physiological symptoms compared to males, while symptom severity was generally lower among vaccinated individuals. Correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between depression and cognitive impairments, underscoring the psychological impact of PASC. This study emphasizes the complexity of PASC, demonstrating how demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and vaccination status influence the severity and duration of symptoms, thereby contributing to the growing understanding of PASC. Further research should consider SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific impacts and broader population samples.">

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent inflammatory agent produced by Gram-negative bacteria and also found in cigarette smoke. Our earlier study revealed that the intranasal exposure of A/J mice to LPS for 7 days altered gene expression levels in alveolar Type II epithelial cells (AECIIs), which serve as precursors to lung adenocarcinoma and are also preferentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2. In the present work, we employed a comprehensive multi-omics approach to characterize changes in DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation, gene expression, and global protein abundances in the AECIIs of A/J mice following the sub-chronic exposure to LPS and after a 4-week recovery period. Exposure to LPS led to hypermethylation at regulatory elements within the genome such as enhancer regions and expression changes in genes known to play a role in lung cancer tumorigenesis. Changes in protein abundance were consistent with an inflammatory phenotype and also included tumor suppressor proteins. Integration of the multi-omics data resulted in a model where LPS-driven inflammation in AECIIs triggers epigenetic changes that, along with genetic mutations, may contribute to lung cancer development.">

        <tr id="The incidence rate of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is rising. However, the pathogenesis of CAPA remains unclear. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disrupts pathways related to type I interferon and Toll-like receptors, key components in innate immunity, thereby elevating the incidence of CAPA. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in T and B cell functional deficiencies or exhaustion within adaptive immunity, weakening the defense against invasive Aspergillus. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances the replication of cytomegalovirus and alters the gut microbiota, factors that may aid in diagnosing CAPA. Immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 patients is also believed to heighten the risk of invasive aspergillosis. Therefore, this review, examines the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with invasive aspergillosis, and explores the pathogenesis and susceptibility factors of CAPA. We propose that variations in an individual’s immune response significantly determine susceptibility to CAPA. The aim of this paper is to deepen clinical understanding of CAPA’s pathogenesis, thereby aiding in mitigating susceptibility risk and advancing novel treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="Background & objectives COVID-19 is a complex disease that affects multiple systems and causes inflammation due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s attraction to ACE-2 receptors. The severity of the disease ranges from mild upper respiratory tract infections to multi-organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Critical clinical features, such as respiratory failure, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, and a hypercoagulable state, are common in severe COVID-19 illness. Identifying patients at higher risk of rapid disease progression leading to severe complications and death is crucial. Available biomarkers lack specificity and accuracy in identifying the severity of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, there is a need to identify specific endothelial biomarkers that can predict early organ damage, facilitate effective management of patients, and categorise multisystem involvement during COVID-19 infection. Methods The participants constituted laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-positive patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) features under home isolation or moderate to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) manifestations requiring admission. The chosen markers were analysed using the Human Luminex multiplex bead-based assay system. Results Our study revealed that certain markers, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and Galectin-3 were elevated in all COVID-19-positive patients, while others, like vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), Angiopoietin-2, Thrombomodulin, and tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) were specifically elevated in patients requiring admission. Such findings indicated the potential of some biomarkers in disease prognostication. Interpretation & conclusions Effective management of COVID-19 requires proper risk stratification. The findings of our investigation underscore the necessity for additional research to confirm the clinical utility and importance of these biomarkers and to fully leverage their capabilities in informing the management of severe COVID-19 disease.">

        <tr id="Aimed to comprehensively investigate the presence of neural autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of COVID‐19 patients experiencing neurological complications during the Omicron wave in China. Forty consecutive COVID‐19 patients with severe neurological complications and 15 disease controls (DC) were enrolled. Neural autoantibodies were detected using both the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on mouse brain tissue and the Brain‐neuronal‐antigen microarray. Our results indicated a significantly higher prevalence of neural autoantibodies in the CSF (62.16% vs. 0.0%) and plasma (38.71% vs. 13.33%) of COVID‐19 patients compared to DC. Additionally, we identified 12 upregulated intrathecal IgG autoantibodies with differential levels between COVID‐19 patients and DC, as well as 51 upregulated IgG autoantibodies in plasma. A high prevalence of anti‐mGluR2 antibodies (13.33%) in COVID‐19 patients was confirmed by cell‐based assays. Western blot analysis showed these antibodies cross‐react with both the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2. Notably, strong binding to both the S protein's RBD‐Fc and mGluR2 was observed, an association that was substantiated by bioinformatics analysis evaluating the similarity between SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins and the targeted antigens on the microarray. This finding hints at a potential cross‐reactivity between anti‐mGluR2 antibodies and the S protein in COVID‐19 patients.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2's continued global health impact underscores the importance of ongoing pathogenesis research. Insights into the host's first line of defense against severe COVID-19 identify actionable biomarkers, informing disease management or therapeutics. Yet, the innate immune response, including cytokines, chemokines, adenosine deaminases (ADAs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), relevant to COVID-19 remain incompletely characterized.


METHODS
Peripheral blood was longitudinally collected between May 2020 and March 2021 from COVID-19 hospitalized adults (N=79) and healthy controls (HCs) (N=14; not tested, assumed COVID-negative, no viral exposure or symptoms). Heparinized blood was fractionated for plasma cryopreservation and in vitro whole blood TLR-stimulation employing TLR-3, -4, and -7/8 agonists. Post-stimulation culture supernatants were analyzed using multiplex and enzymatic assays.


RESULTS
Upon hospitalization, plasma concentrations of IFNγ, IL-6, CXCL10, and ADAs, were significantly upregulated compared to convalescent time points and HCs. Participants with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs concentrations upon admission. Plasma cytokines, chemokines, and ADAs positively correlated and associated with distinct temporal patterns. TLR-stimulated cell cultures from patients produced reduced IFNα2, IFNγ, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70 compared to HCs or later time points.


CONCLUSION
Higher plasma concentrations of IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs at admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Reduced TLR-mediated IFNα2, IFNγ, and IL-12p70 production suggests COVID dampens Th1-polarizing innate immune responses, providing insight into immunological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="The immune system plays a major role in pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a devastating lung disease with limited treatment options. Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune cells with remarkable immunosuppressive functions. We hypothesized that their anti‐inflammatory activity may dampen PF by inhibiting inflammation and its transition to fibrosis. Here, we studied the emergence of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)‐ and monocytic (M)‐MDSCs in a murine model of PF. We assessed immunological, histopathological, and clinical changes at days 3, 7, 14, and 21 following bleomycin challenge. A comprehensive overview of the role of MDSCs during the acute lung injury and chronic phase of pulmonary fibrosis is provided, along with the effects of MDSCs adoptive transfer and depletion. Inflammation and fibrosis increased over a period of 21 days after bleomycin administration. In the lung, the number of PMN‐MDSCs increased, while M‐MDSCs decreased over the time following bleomycin challenge. Especially, M‐MDSCs showed enhanced suppressive activity on day 3 following bleomycin challenge. Adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs attenuated inflammation and fibrosis development. However, depletion of PMN‐MDSCs did not lead to an exacerbation of PF. Our results suggest that adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs can ameliorate the inflammatory responses and thus the development of fibrosis in a bleomycin‐induced pulmonary fibrosis model.">

        <tr id="Respiratory virus infections, such as those caused by influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and coronaviruses, pose a significant global health burden. While the immune system’s adaptive components, including memory T cells, are critical for recognizing and combating these pathogens, recurrent infections and variable disease outcomes persist. Memory T cells are a key element of long-term immunity, capable of responding swiftly upon re-exposure to pathogens. They play diverse roles, including cross-reactivity to conserved viral epitopes and modulation of inflammatory responses. However, the protective efficacy of these cells is influenced by several factors, including viral evolution, host age, and immune system dynamics. This review explores the dichotomy of memory T cells in respiratory virus infections: their potential to confer robust protection and the limitations that allow for breakthrough infections. Understanding the underlying mechanisms governing the formation, maintenance, and functional deployment of memory T cells in respiratory mucosa is critical for improving immunological interventions. We highlight recent advances in vaccine strategies aimed at bolstering T cell-mediated immunity and discuss the challenges posed by viral immune evasion. Addressing these gaps in knowledge is pivotal for designing effective therapeutics and vaccines to mitigate the global burden of respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most patients recover fully after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2. Some, however, may develop pulmonary sequelae (PS) and/or long COVID (LC). However, whether these two clinical conditions have similar or different pathogenic mechanisms is unknown. Methods The levels of autoantibodies and 184 inflammatory and organ damage associated proteins in plasma were determined (by immunofluorescence and Olink panels, respectively) 1 year after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2 in 51 patients with PS (DLCO < 80% ref), 31 patients with LC and 31 patients fully recovered (Rec). PS was defined by the presence of reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) lower than 80% ref. LC was defined by the presence of chronic symptoms in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Results We found that patients with PS or LC both showed increased levels than Rec of anti-microbial, immune cell activation and recruitment related proteins. Patients with PS showed higher levels of anti-nuclear autoantibodies, whereas LC patients had increased levels of organ-damage associated proteins. In patients with PS most of the elevated proteins correlate with the impairment of lung function (DLCO). Finally, in PS we additionally performed the determinations at an earlier time point (6 months) and showed that the expression of CCL20 and IFN-ɣ was already higher at 6 months, while CCL3 and CCL19 increase from 6 to 12 months, suggesting a pathogenic role in PS persistence. Conclusions Patients with PS or LC have abnormal but different persistent circulatory immune and organ damage biomarkers, suggesting different underlying biology of both post-COVID conditions.

        <tr id="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. Des-ignated as an epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020, the virus quickly escalated to a global emergency, officially declared a pandemic in March 2020. With over 6 million recorded deaths and more than 200 identified symptoms in diverse individuals, the impact of COVID-19 is substantial. COVID-19 poses a greater risk to individuals with advanced HIV, while those with well-managed HIV are not at increased risk. Although COVID-19 vaccines are generally effective for people with HIV, some may experience reduced vaccine effectiveness and breakthrough infections due to suboptimal immune responses. Long COVID, affecting at least 65 million individuals, adds a layer of complexity. The virus's rapid mutation has led to diverse symptomatology, prompting adjustments in treatment guidelines. This review compre-hensively examines repurposed antiviral drug candidates against COVID-19, explores immune responses across different age groups, delves into the mechanisms of COVID-19 vaccines, and discusses potential immunosuppressants. Additionally, the focus extends to Intravenous Immu-noglobulin (IVIG), steroids, and anti-cytokine therapy as promising avenues to address cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a critical condition in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Introduction. The continued epidemic relevance of SARS-CoV-2, even after the end of the associated COVID-19 pandemic in 2023, necessitates further study of the interaction of this virus with the first line of cellular defense, neutrophils. 
The aim of the study was to determine the enzymatic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes of Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) in the dynamics of ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection, which characterizes the microbicidal potential of innate immunity cells. 
Materials and methods. The SARS-CoV-2/Vladivostok/R-8726/2021 strain was used at infectious doses of 3 lg (TCID50/mL) and 2 lg (TCID50/mL) (TCID50 is the 50% tissue cytopathic dose for the Vero E6 cell line); the contact time of the infecting virus-containing liquid with the cell culture was 1 h. The number of viable cells in the adherent leukocyte culture was counted using an inverted microscope equipped with a digital camera and MCView program. The specific (per 1 viable cell) activities of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), 5′-nucleotidase (adenosine monophosphatase, AMPase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and cytochrome oxidase (CCO) were determined spectrophotometrically after incubation with specific substrates of infected and uninfected cell cultures 1, 16, 24, 48 h after virus inoculation. 
Results. The enzymatic activity of leukocytes 1 h after virus inoculation, compared to uninfected leukocytes, was as follows: specific activity of ATPase, MPO was decreased, activity of AMPase, LDH, SDH was increased; 16 h after virus inoculation, activity of MPO was decreased, activity of AMPase, LDH, SDH was increased, activity of ATPase and CCO was at the initial level, i.e. approximately at the level of the uninfected control; 24 h after virus inoculation, AMPase activity was decreased, ATPase activity was increased, LDH, SDH, MPO, CCO activity was at the initial level; 48 h after virus inoculation, ATPase, LDH, SDH, MPO, CCO activity was increased, AMPase activity was at the initial level. Changes in enzymatic activity depend on the infecting dose and correlate with virus accumulation in the culture medium. 
Conclusion. The revealed dynamics of enzymatic activity in the primary culture of adherent leukocytes ex vivo infected with SARS-CoV-2 indicates a decrease in the microbicidal potential of cells of innate immunity in the course of this infection.">

        <tr id="Toxoplasma gondii non-archetypal strains have distinct virulence profiles and immunological activation in the host when compared with archetypal strains. The present work aims to perform an analysis of the inflammatory profile during acute and early chronic infection by T. gondii atypical strain in an experimental murine model. After euthanasia, blood was collected for the quantification of specific IgG antibodies and their subtypes (IgG1/IgG3) by ELISA; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was realized and immunophenotyping of lymphocytes population was performed at 12-and 30-days post infection (dpi); the levels of IFN-γ , IL-12, IL-10, TNF-α , IL-6, IL-17, nitric oxide and total proteins were determined in the BAL supernatant. Tissue cyst burden was determined in the brain homogenate, and the parasite load in the lungs was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Infection with the CK4 strain induced a lower brain cyst load similar parasite burden in the lungs, and higher levels of IgG1 and IgG3, when compared to ME49. The group infected with the CK4 strain presented higher levels of systemic IFN-γ , and both infected groups displayed similarly elevated levels of systemic TNF-α , IL-6 and IL-17 at 30 dpi, as well as higher numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes in the acute stage of infection, followed by higher numbers of central and effector CD4 + T cells. IFN-γ levels in the BAL fluid were significantly higher in animals infected with the CK4 strain in both the acute and early chronic stage of infection, highlighting the involvement of the lung environment.">

        <tr id="Introduction Severe COVID-19 is characterized by hyperimmune host responses contributing to airway damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Type III interferons (IFN), including IFN lambda 4 (IFNλ4), expressed in individuals harboring the rs368234815-ΔG allele, are implicated in host immune responses to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Methods We investigated associations between IFNλ4 expression through genotyping and COVID-19 disease severity in 853 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases enrolled in the All-Ireland Infectious Diseases Cohort. Additionally, we measured plasma levels of Type I, II and III IFN using quantitative immunoassays along with IFNλ4 expression and COVID-19 disease severity in a sub-group [n=321 (37.6%)] with samples available within 10 days of symptom onset. IFNλ4 was expressed in 382 (44.8%) but expression was not significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Results Within the sub-group, we found no consistent associations between IFNλ4 expression and circulating IFNs. However, we observed significantly increased expression of IFNλ1 and IFNλ2 in severe COVID-19 (P<0.01), with IFNλ2 remaining significantly associated after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities, including obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) (P<0.001). Interestingly, although IFNλ2 levels were significantly higher in subjects with obesity, the association between higher IFNλ2 and COVID-19 disease severity was only observed in individuals without obesity (P<0.01). Conclusion These data reveal an important role for IFNλ2 as an immune correlate that predicts COVID-19 disease severity, which may be masked in those with obesity.">

        <tr id="Background Acute lung injury (ALI), including its most severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a common cause of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Although its clinical characteristics have been well characterized, the relevant mechanism remains unclear. An imbalance in autophagy leads to alveolar remodeling and triggers the pathogenesis of ARDS. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of the STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine (Fluda) in ALI. C57BL6 mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and their lung tissues were analyzed via next-generation transcriptome sequencing. Results Western blotting revealed that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was highly expressed and STAT1 was phosphorylated following LPS exposure. Fluda significantly decreased the protein expression of STAT1/IRF1 and inhibited the alveolar infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. Nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release was decreased in the lungs of mice and RAW264.7 macrophages following Fluda treatment. In LPS-induced GFP-LC3 transgenic mice treated with Fluda, the counts of LC3-expressing neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid were significantly decreased. Furthermore, Fluda decreased LC3 and p62 protein expression, thereby inhibiting the release of NO, IL-6, and TNF-α in BAL. In RAW264.7 cells, the inhibition of STAT1/IRF1 by Fluda decreased LPS-induced ERK and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Conclusions The inhibition of STAT1/IRF1 by Fluda plays a pivotal role in modulating dysregulated autophagy by suppressing the MAPK and NF-κB p65 pathways in ALI.

        <tr id="Impaired spermatogenesis has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on male fertility remains unclear. The purpose of this multicenter study was to investigate the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility and determine the potential reasons leading to impaired male reproductive functions. In silico approach identified ~60 amino acid sequences containing at least five continuous residues shared by SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and spermatogenesis-linked proteins. Four synthetic peptides were tested with sera from independent cohorts of patients with acute and long COVID-19 syndrome (LCS), and naïve vaccinated subjects. Immunogenicity and pathogenicity studies were performed by immunizing mice with two selected peptides and testing the antigenicity of induced antibodies. While none of four peptides were recognized by antibodies from vaccinated people, infected patients exhibited high reactivity to peptide 4, and LCS patients, especially women, showed elevated antibody levels against peptide 2. Women with LCS and chronic fatigue syndrome had higher levels of peptide 2–reacting antibodies than those with idiopathic chronic fatigue syndrome. Noteworthy, peptide 2 antibodies showed, in in vitro experiment, a specific interaction with mouse testicular tissue antigens. These findings raise the possibility that cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and spermatogenesis-related antigens may affect infected patients’ fertility, suggesting a potential for autoimmune responses with human consequences.">

        <tr id="The immune characteristics and pathological mechanisms of COVID‐19 and tuberculosis coinfection are not well understood. Single‐cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting complex immune responses and cellular interactions in infectious diseases. Here, we employed scRNA‐seq, combined with laboratory examinations and clinical observations, to elucidate potential mechanisms of immunopathology and protective immunity in coinfected patients. Substantial alterations in immune cell populations in patients with severe coinfection were observed, characterized by severe lymphopenia and massive expansion of myeloid cells. Lymphocytopenia may have resulted from lymphocyte apoptosis and migration. Systemic upregulation of S100 family proteins, mainly released by classical monocytes, might contribute to inflammatory cytokine storm via S100‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway in severely coinfected patients. Myeloid cells may contribute to immune paralysis in severe cases through expansion of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and dysregulated dendritic cell function. The immune landscape of T cells in severe patients were featured by dysregulated Th1 response, widespread exhaustion and increased cytotoxic, apoptosis, migration and inflammatory states. We observed increased plasma cells and overexpression of B‐cell‐activation‐related pathways in severe patients. Together, we provide a comprehensive atlas illustrating the immune response to coinfected patients at the single‐cell resolution and highlight mechanisms of pathogenesis in severe patients.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a major global health crisis with widespread effects on healthcare, society, and economies. Initially seen as a respiratory illness, it is now recognized as a multisystem disease, with growing evidence of its impact on the nervous system. 
Neurological complications - such as cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), strokes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and mood disorders - have been reported in both severe and mild COVID-19 cases, highlighting the unpredictable nature of post-COVID sequelae. These symptoms can persist long after the acute phase of infection. 
The mechanisms behind these effects are complex and not yet fully understood. They include direct viral invasion of the central nervous system, immune dysregulation (e.g., cytokine storm, autoimmunity), and blood–brain barrier disruption, all of which may lead to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. 
The long-term neurological consequences pose significant clinical and societal challenges, requiring multidisciplinary care and tailored rehabilitation strategies.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis, highlighting the virus’s unique molecular mechanisms that distinguish it from other respiratory pathogens. It is known that the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α) activates a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways regulating cellular energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell survival, contributing to the wide range of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS). Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of HIF-1α is a key driver of systemic inflammation, silent hypoxia, and pathological tissue remodeling in both the acute and post-acute phases of the disease. This scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in INPLASY. It involved a literature search in Scopus and PubMed, supplemented by manual reference screening, with study selection facilitated by Rayyan software. Our analysis clarifies the dual role of HIF-1α, which may either worsen inflammatory responses and viral persistence or support adaptive mechanisms that reduce cellular damage. The potential for targeting HIF-1α therapeutically in COVID-19 is complex, requiring further investigation to clarify its precise role and translational applications. This review deepens the molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular and tissue dysfunction in hypoxia, offering insights for improving clinical management strategies and addressing long-term sequelae.">

In addition, c-ABL targeting attenuates F-actin reorganization induced by DENV infection. Together with the involvement of c-ABL in endothelial dysfunction induced by DENV and host secreted factors, our findings strongly suggest that c-ABL is a potential host-targeted antiviral that could control DENV infection and/or its evolution to more severe forms of the disease.">

Limited data exist regarding antibody responses to breakthrough infections caused by the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS‐CoV‐2. This study aimed to compare antibody levels and their relationships with clinical features in patients with breakthrough infections.Sera from patients with breakthrough infections were analyzed for IgG, IgM, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) using a fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer. Antibody levels were then compared and correlated with clinical features.Booster COVID‐19 vaccination was associated with higher levels of NAb and IgG in breakthrough‐infected individuals (β = 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12–0.90, and β = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.35–1.33, respectively). Individuals infected with the Delta variant exhibited higher IgM and IgA levels compared with those infected with the Omicron variant (β = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.46–1.14, and β = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.13–0.98, respectively). The SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA clearance time was negatively correlated with NAb and IgG levels in Delta infections (correlation coefficient rs = −0.31 and −0.26, respectively) and Omicron infections (rs = −0.29 and −0.32, respectively).Patients with breakthrough infections of the Delta variant exhibited higher IgM and IgA levels than those with breakthrough infections of the Omicron variant. Elevated NAb and IgG levels, associated with booster COVID‐19 vaccination, correlated with shorter SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA clearance times. These findings underscore the enhanced immunogenicity of booster vaccination in mitigating the duration of viral RNA positivity.">

        <tr id="Cognitive dysfunction represents one of the most persistent and disabling features of Long COVID, yet its molecular underpinnings remain incompletely understood. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term neurocognitive sequelae. Key processes include persistent neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial dysfunction, immune dysregulation, and neuroendocrine imbalance. Microglial activation and cytokine release (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) promote synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury, while activation of inflammasomes such as NLRP3 amplifies CNS inflammation. Vascular abnormalities, including microthrombosis and BBB leakage, facilitate the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and neurotoxic mediators. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction and reduced vagal tone further exacerbate systemic inflammation and autonomic imbalance. Biomarkers such as GFAP, NFL, IL-6, and S100B have been associated with both neuroinflammation and cognitive symptoms. Notably, transcriptomic signatures in Long COVID overlap with those observed in Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting shared pathways involving tau dysregulation, oxidative stress, and glial reactivity. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for identifying at-risk individuals and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. This review underscores the need for longitudinal research and integrative biomarker analysis to elucidate the molecular trajectory of cognitive impairment in Long COVID.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global population. The infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2, presents with a variety of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic cases to more severe forms, including a variety of neurological symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, brain fog, paresthesias, dysautonomia, anosmia, and dysgeusia. Additionally, the disease is associated with the long COVID syndrome, in which there is persistence of the effects and symptoms of the acute phase. In recent years the literature has shown relevant data on long COVID, but there is still a need to deepen the knowledge about these long term manifestations. Thus, the present study aimed to describe the main neurological sequelae resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-hospitalized population during the long phase of the disease, gathering scientific evidence through an integrative review of the prevalence of symptoms, patient profile, duration and severity of sequelae, risk factors, comorbidities, and possible nervous system structural damage. The PubMed/Medline database was used with descriptors and, at the end of the screening process with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 studies were included. A group of neurological symptoms associated with long COVID was identified: myalgia, dysgeusia, memory alterations, olfactory dysfunction, dizziness, and pain. Most patients presented multiple symptoms that lasted for more than one year with a significant impact on quality of life. The main risk factors were dyslipidemia, age, ethnicity, muscle/ joint pain, and sex. This review highlights the importance of further studies on the syndrome, its etiology, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatments.">

        <tr id="Abstract Autoimmune limbic encephalitis is an inflammatory condition confined to the limbic system of the brain that is deemed to be due to a dysregulated immune response. However, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. Diagnosis of autoimmune limbic encephalitis currently relies on clinical consensus criteria. However, diagnostic workup can be challenging, potentially delaying treatment initiation associated with poor clinical outcomes. We retrospectively identified 640 patients (81 autoimmune limbic encephalitis, 148 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, 197 Alzheimer’s disease, 67 frontotemporal dementia, 37 temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and 110 somatic symptom disorder patients). Applying multidimensional flow-cytometry together with novel computational approaches, we analysed the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid immune cell profiles at different disease stages and performed correlations with clinical parameters (i.e. neuropsychological performance, EEG and MRI). We were able to identify a shared immune signature of autoimmune limbic encephalitis showing similarities in adaptive B and T cell response with other inflammatory central nervous system diseases and in T cell patterns with neurodegenerative disorders. Antibody-negative autoimmune limbic encephalitis showed a pronounced T cell response in peripheral blood similar to temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders differentiating from antibody-positive autoimmune limbic encephalitis and classical inflammatory central nervous system diseases with regard to B and plasma cell response. Longitudinal immune cell phenotyping in autoimmune limbic encephalitis revealed dynamic changes over time mainly affecting the innate, B and plasma cell compartment. Correlation analysis indicated associations between the baseline immune cell profile, especially lymphocytes, and neuropsychological performance, as well as EEG and MRI abnormalities. Applying novel computational approaches, we found that multidimensional flow cytometry together with routine CSF parameters could reliably distinguish autoimmune limbic encephalitis from controls and clinical differential diagnoses. Incorporation of multidimensional flow cytometry parameters showed superior discriminatory ability compared with CSF routine parameters alone. Taken together, autoimmune limbic encephalitis is characterized by a B and T cell dominated intrathecal immune-cell signature corresponding to changes reported in the brain parenchyma and showing similarities with classical inflammatory central nervous system diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Incorporating clinical parameters and applying novel computational approaches, we could show that multidimensional flow cytometry might be a beneficial complement to the established diagnostic workup of autoimmune limbic encephalitis promoting early diagnosis and facilitating outcome prediction to enhance individualized treatment regimes.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, young children, and immunocompromised individuals. Currently, FDA-approved monoclonal antibody therapies are limited to infants and young children with severe RSV disease. As a result, there is an urgent need for comprehensive studies of RSV pathogenesis to support the development of new therapeutic strategies. Exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) have recently emerged as key regulators in various viral infections. Our previous work identified EPAC isoform 2 (EPAC2) as a critical factor in RSV replication and host innate immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying EPAC2’s role in RSV infection remain unclear. In this study, we investigated EPAC2-mediated RSV infection by identifying EPAC2-interacting proteins. Proteomics and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that junction plakoglobin (JUP) interacts with EPAC2 in both mock- and RSV-infected cells, with this interaction notably enhanced during RSV infection. To determine JUP’s role in RSV infection, we compared viral replication in JUP-deficient and control cells. JUP downregulation significantly reduced the production of infectious RSV particles, likely by impairing viral budding and viral gene transcription. Moreover, our findings indicate that JUP is essential for an effective cellular immune response to RSV infection. Together, these results suggest that EPAC2 and JUP may cooperatively regulate RSV replication and dissemination.">

This review elucidates the multifaceted impact of SARS-CoV-2 on diabetes mellitus, emphasizing the increased complexity of glycemic management in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection following viral infection in the postpandemic era. In this study, we examined the diverse effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on individuals with diabetes. These effects included an elevated risk of morbidity, erratic fluctuations in blood glucose levels, the emergence of complications associated with diabetes, and the emergence of challenges related to self-management of the disease. From a mechanistic perspective, we investigated the following factors: SARS-CoV-2-mediated direct damage to islet beta cells, dysregulation of the RAAS system, impairment of islet function by oxidative stress, and the effects of the integrated stress response, stress response, and reduced adiponectin levels on insulin utilization efficiency and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, viral effects extend to diabetic complications and cardiovascular risk factors, such as coagulation abnormalities, hypertension, and lipid metabolism. This results in an exacerbation of the development of diabetic complications. This review highlights the urgent need for refined management strategies for patients with diabetes during the pandemic and in the later stages of COVID-19. Additionally, there is a need for integrated management strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the long-term outcomes of patients with diabetes.">

        <tr id="Objective and design SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are recommended for mastocytosis patients. We describe clinical symptoms, chemokine, cytokine, metabolomic and lipidomic derangements in a systemic mastocytosis patient following mRNA-1273 booster vaccination. Methods Twenty-eight chemokines and cytokines, 41 amino acids and 16 lipid classes were quantified with state-of-the-art methods. Results Mast cell activation (MCA) symptoms started 24 h after the mRNA-1273 booster vaccination with significant metabolic, lipidomic and cytokine derangements. Histamine concentrations peaked at life-threatening 18 ng/ml concomitant with high tryptase. Peak plasma IL-1Ra, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, CXCL10 and GM-CSF concentrations were elevated 54-, 4.9-, 85-, 54-, 6.1-, 19- and 6.4-fold respectively. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, was administered 6 h after admission, because of the highly elevated IL-6 concentrations. More than one year later IL-6 was highly elevated during another MCA attack likely caused by a PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and tocilizumab was again used. Clinical symptoms improved during the following 12 h similar to the vaccine booster MCA attack. Conclusions A mRNA-1273 first booster vaccination likely caused a delayed severe MCA attack with highly elevated Th2-biased cytokines with metabolic and lipidomic derangements. Administration of an IL-6 receptor blocker during both MCA attacks might have shortened the duration of clinical symptoms.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revealed the phenotypic and functional diversity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), identifying specific populations that directly impact the antitumor response. However, despite the recognition of TAMs as promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment, research is hindered by the lack of validated human preclinical models. Here, we applied scRNA-seq to a 3D human cell-based model comprising tumor cell line-derived spheroids, cancer-associated fibroblasts and primary monocytes, a setup widely used in immuno-oncology research. Integration of our in vitro data with publicly available patient-derived datasets showed that the macrophages in this model share phenotypic characteristics with the pro-angiogenic and pro-fibrotic SPP1+ TAM population recently found across multiple cancer types and inflammatory lung diseases. This population was linked to aspects of disease progression and associated with poor prognosis in several tumor indications, highlighting the need for relevant models enabling its study as an immunotherapy target. Our research validates the use of a 3D human cell-based culture as a more in vivo-relevant model and enables the preclinical testing of novel macrophage-targeting drugs in a human disease-relevant setup.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) is the term for a condition with persistent symptoms in a proportion of COVID-19 patients after asymptomatic, mild, or severe disease courses. Numbers vary, but the current estimate is that after COVID-19 approximately 10% develop PCS. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and associations with the development of PCS with fatigue, post-exertional malaise (PEM), orthostatic dysregulation, autonomous dysregulation, and/or neurocognitive dysregulation.


METHODS
By combining medical record data from a prospective observational study with symptom analysis before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we aimed to identify potential risk factors and predictive markers for PCS. Additionally, we analyzed blood, saliva, and stool samples from this well-characterized PCS patient cohort to biologically validate our findings.


RESULTS
We identified significant associations between pre-existing GI complaints and the development of PCS Fatigue. PCS patients showed higher LBP/sCD14 ratios, lower IL-33 levels, and higher IL-6 levels compared to control groups. Our results highlight the critical role of the GI tract in PCS development of post-viral Fatigue.


CONCLUSION
We propose that the viral infection disrupts pathways related to the innate immune response and GI barrier function, evidenced by intestinal low-grade inflammation and GI barrier leakage. Monitoring GI symptoms and markers before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for identifying predictive clinical phenotypes in PCS. Understanding the interaction between viral infections, immune responses, and gut integrity could lead to more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies, ultimately reducing the burden on PCS patients.">

Despite substantial advancements in preventing severe COVID-19 cases through vaccination, the rise in the prevalence of long COVID syndrome and a notable degree of genomic mutation, primarily in the S protein, underscores the necessity for a deeper understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, the latest part of this series, we investigate the potential pathophysiological molecular mechanisms triggered by the interaction between the spike protein and cellular receptors. Therefore, this review aims to provide a differential and focused view on the mechanisms potentially activated by the binding of the spike protein to canonical and non-canonical receptors for SARS-CoV-2, together with their possible interactions and effects on the pathogenesis of long COVID.">

This dysregulated response is characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory mediators, an overactivation of the innate immune system, 1 lymphopenia, 2 delayed antibody and interferon responses, 3 and a massive dissemination of viral components into the blood, 4 all of which contribute to severity and increased mortality. 5–7 These immune and non-immune parameters can be integrated into so-called combitypes 8 to identify subgroups of patients with different immune profiles and outcomes, helping to guide clinical strategies. In a previous study we used viral RNA levels in plasma to categorize a multicentre cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients into three subgroups with different mortality rate. 4 In this study, we combined virological data (SARS-CoV-2 N1 RNA plasma load and N-antigenemia) and 32 host response biomarkers to improve classification of critically ill COVID-19 patients, with the objective to identify biological clues explaining survival.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the new coronavirus 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 - SARS-CoV-2). Long COVID is a new condition associated with persistent COVID-19 symptoms and/or new emerging symptoms. Telomeres are specialised structures for genome protection at the end of chromosomes and telomerase is the enzyme that synthesises telomere DNA. OBJECTIVES Patients with Long COVID symptoms were recruited at the Pedro Ernesto University Hospital (HUPE) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the main purpose of investigating the association between telomere length and Long COVID. METHODS Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 34 Long COVID patients compared to a control group (n = 122). Telomerase activity was determined by qPCR assays using the commercial kit from ScienCell. A questionnaire on symptoms, vaccine doses and blood count was completed. FINDINGS The Long COVID patients were found to have an increase in LTL. Telomerase activity was also examined in a smaller number of patients and found to be reactivated in the blood. MAIN CONCLUSIONS It will be necessary to conduct further studies and monitor Long COVID patients to determine if future health issues could be linked to telomerase activity and elongated telomeres.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound global impact. Therapeutic strategies to bridge the crucial 'lockdown' timespan between the emergence of a new virus and vaccine rollout are needed.


METHODS
We recently demonstrated that intranasal (i.n.) administration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in sentinel hamsters can limit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission from acutely infected index littermates. The current study investigates if functional immunity develops during i.n. prophylaxis in the same model.


RESULTS
Lung tissue was free from infectious virus and pneumonia in sentinel hamsters after i.n. CCP prophylaxis, unlike those receiving non-immune control plasma (NIP). However, throat swabs from both groups contained viral RNA similar to intentionally infected index littermates. Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies were detected in plasma from both sentinel groups two days after it showed in index littermates. This immune response was functional because all sentinel hamsters were protected from reinfection by the same viral strain.


CONCLUSION
Our findings demonstrate that i.n. CCP prophylaxis prevents lung disease in hamsters by restraining the infection to the upper respiratory tract, while still promoting a functional humoral immune response that protects against reinfection.">

The pathogenesis of this persistent post Covid-19 Condition (PCC) is, however, largely unknown. We hypothesized that persistent T cell activation and exhaustion play a role in PCC development.We examined plasma levels of soluble (s) CD25, TIM-3 and LAG-3, all markers of T cell activation/exhaustion, by enzyme immunoassays in 170 home-isolated and 53 hospitalized patients for up to 18 months after COVID-19 in relation to persistent symptomatology.Our major findings were: (i) Cases with persistent dyspnea and fatigue had markedly higher sCD25 at 6–18 months with a more modest increase in sTIM-3. (ii) Cases with memory problems at 12–18 months had increased sLAG-3 iii) sCD25 correlated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and microneutralization titers only in cases with PCC while sTIM-3 correlated with these parameters irrespectively of symptoms. iv) Although hospitalized patients had markedly elevated levels of T cell activation/exhausting markers during follow-up, there was no relation to PCC symptoms.Our study indicates a role for T cell activation/exhaustion in PCC following home isolated COVID-19 infection, with somewhat different patterns of sCD25, sTIM-3 and sLAG-3, but not in hospitalized COVID-19 patients where disease severity may be more important.">

It affects multiple systems, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are known to be susceptible to COVID-19. Surprisingly, there is a certain correlation and similarity between these two diseases to some extent. In this study, we performed a systematic review of relevant studies published on PubMed from December 2019 to January 2023 from the aspects of the clinical features of SLE patients with COVID-19, the immunological similarities between COVID-19 and SLE, the prevention and therapeutic approach of SLE patients with COVID-19, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SLE patients. Our findings indicate that SLE patients at higher risk of COVID-19 infection than the general population, and SLE patients treated with glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants have a higher rate of hospitalization. Consequently, the use of immunosuppressants during COVID-19 infection in SLE patients is of concern and additional treatment approaches should be explored. Moreover, SLE patients with COVID-19 also face challenges in accessing healthcare, financial hardship, and psychological distress. These issues require further attention and can be addressed by providing telemedicine, ensuring adequate supplies of medicines and promoting psychological well-beings. Together, this article summarizes the correlation and similarity between SLE and COVID-19, and provides a detailed and practical guide for the prevention, treatment and nursing of SLE patients with COVID-19. Moreover, this article also discusses the fields that require further research and provide reference for the management of other autoimmune diseases in the case of viral infection.">

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, recent findings indicate that it also significantly disrupts the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, contributing to disease severity, systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections and chronic conditions. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, exacerbates the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and has been linked to long-COVID, a condition affecting a significant proportion of survivors and manifesting with over 200 symptoms across multiple organ systems. Despite the growing recognition of microbiome alterations in COVID-19, the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the microbiome and influences disease progression remain poorly understood. This narrative review investigates the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host-microbiota dynamics and evaluates its implications in disease severity and for developing personalized therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Furthermore, it highlights the dual role of the microbiome in modulating disease progression, and as a promising target for advancing diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches in managing COVID-19.">

Peripheral blood cytokine profiles may predict the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but none have been identified in US Veterans. Methods We analyzed peripheral blood cytokine profiles from 202 participants in the EPIC3 study, a prospective observational cohort of US Veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 across 15 VA medical centers. Illness severity was assessed based on the highest level documented during the first 60 days after recruitment. We correlated cytokine levels with illness severity using LASSO logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models on a 70% training set and calculated the AUC on a 30% test set. Results LASSO regression identified 6 cytokines as predictors of SARS-CoV-2 severity with 77.3% AUC in the test set. Random forest and XGBoost models achieved an AUC of 80.4% and 80.7% in the test set, respectively. All models assigned a feature importance to each cytokine, with IP-10, MCP-1, and HGF consistently identified as key markers. Conclusions Cytokine profiles are predictive of SARS-CoV-2 severity in US Veterans and may guide tailored interventions for improved patient management.

        <tr id="Dengue is an important tropical disease with considerable global impact. Despite this, there remains an urgent need for reliable biomarkers to predict disease severity, as well as effective antiviral drugs and targeted treatments. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of 41 plasma mediators in patients with asymptomatic dengue (AD) and symptomatic dengue (SD), which includes mild dengue fever (DF) and severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Our findings revealed that the levels of nearly all measured mediators were consistently lower in AD compared to SD patients, suggesting a potential protective cytokine response signature. Time-course cytokine analysis in SD shown significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammation and viral clearance upon the acute phase, while various growth factors were elevated during the convalescence. Notably, we identified elevated IL-15 levels in DHF patients three days before fever subsidence, highlighting its potential as an early prognostic biomarker for severe disease outcomes. Furthermore, prolonged high levels of IL-8 and IP-10 in DHF during the critical period may contribute to dengue immunopathogenesis. This study advances the understanding of cytokine dynamics in the natural course of human dengue infection, providing valuable insights for the development of targeted treatments and prognostic biomarkers.

We have harnessed our patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem cell–derived, multicell lung organoid model to investigate critical aspects of COVID-19, including viral tropism and routes of entry, lung-specific immune response, and a role for surfactant protein B in innate immunity, viral surveillance, cell survival, and inflammation.

        <tr id="Significance Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve its Spike (S) protein sequence to avoid immunization constraints. To develop a more durable intervention to combat COVID-19, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production which activates hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) to shift metabolism from OXPHOS to glycolysis, thus redirecting substrates toward viral biogenesis. To counteract this viral strategy, we increased the mitochondrial antioxidant capacity of mice by mitochondrially targeted catalase or EUK8 and demonstrated that these interventions significantly reduced the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This strategy would not be subject to SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutational resistance and might mitigate the pathology of other viruses.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory immune response. Monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been observed in monocytes of patients with COVID-19, but the mechanism and consequences of inflammasome activation require further investigation. In this study, we inoculated a macrophage-like THP-1 cell line, primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, and primary monocytes with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages does not rely on viral replication, receptor-mediated entry, or actin-dependent entry. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hNEC cultures without triggering the production of inflammasome cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. Importantly, these cytokines did not inhibit viral replication in hNEC cultures. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of primary monocytes led to inflammasome activation and induced a macrophage phenotype in these cells. Monocytic cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not from peripheral blood, of patients with COVID-19, showed evidence of inflammasome activation, expressed the proinflammatory marker CD11b, and displayed oxidative burst. These findings highlight the central role of activated macrophages, as a result of direct viral sensing, in COVID-19 and support the inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 as potential therapeutic strategies to reduce immunopathology without increasing viral replication.


IMPORTANCE
Inflammasome activation is associated with severe COVID-19. The impact of inflammasome activation on viral replication and mechanistic details of this activation are not clarified. This study advances our understanding of the role of inflammasome activation in macrophages by identifying TLR2, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 as dependent factors in this activation. Further, it highlights that SARS-CoV-2 inflammasome activation is not a feature of nasal epithelial cells but rather activation of bystander macrophages in the airway. Finally, we demonstrate that two pro inflammatory cytokines produced by inflammasome activation, IL-18 and IL-1β, do not restrict viral replication and are potential targets to ameliorate pathological inflammation in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Emerging evidence shows increased humoral response post-omicron surge, but research on T cell responses is limited. This study investigated the durability, magnitude, and breadth of SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific T cell responses in 216 two-dose vaccinated individuals pre- and post-omicron surge. Post-surge samples showed enhanced T cell responses, indicating widespread asymptomatic exposure to omicron. Further analysis of 105 individuals with multiple exposures to SARS-CoV-2 through boosters or infections showed that post-omicron, two-dose vaccinated individuals had T cell responses comparable to those of COVID-19 convalescents or boosted individuals. Additionally, we report cross-reactive T cell responses against omicron sub-variants, including BA2.86, remained strong, with preserved frequencies of spike-specific stem-cell-like memory T cells. In silico prediction indicates that mutated epitopes of JN.1 and KP.2 retain over 95.6% of their HLA binding capability. Overall, our data suggests that T cell responses are sustained, enhanced, and cross-reactive against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants following symptomatic or asymptomatic omicron infection.">

        <tr id="The severity of COVID-19 is linked to excessive inflammation. Neutrophils represent a critical arm of the innate immune response and are major mediators of inflammation, but their role in COVID-19 pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We conducted transcriptomic profiling of neutrophils obtained from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, as well as from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, in comparison to non-infected healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the inflammasome formation potential in neutrophils from patients and mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), consisting mainly of mature neutrophils, revealed a striking type I interferon (IFN-I) gene signature in severe COVID-19 patients, contrasting with mild COVID-19 and healthy controls. Notably, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) from severe COVID-19 patients exhibited an immature neutrophil phenotype and lacked this IFN-I signature. Moreover, PMNs from severe COVID-19 patients showed heightened nigericin-induced caspase1 activation, but reduced responsiveness to exogenous inflammasome priming. Furthermore, IFN-I emerged as a priming stimulus for neutrophil inflammasomes. These findings suggest a potential role for neutrophil inflammasomes in driving inflammation during severe COVID-19. Altogether, these findings open promising avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate the pathological processes associated with the disease.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced cell death is a key contributor to COVID-19 pathology. Cell death induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well studied in myeloid cells but less in its primary host cell type, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing human airway epithelia (HAE). SARS-CoV-2 induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in HAE organotypic cultures. Single-cell and limiting-dilution analysis revealed that necroptosis is the primary cell death event in infected cells, whereas uninfected bystanders undergo apoptosis, and pyroptosis occurs later during infection. Mechanistically, necroptosis is induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA–binding protein 1 (ZBP1) in HAE and lung tissues from patients with COVID-19. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, which causes more severe disease than Omicron (B1.1.529) in humans, is associated with orders of magnitude–greater Z-RNA/ZBP1 interactions, necroptosis, and disease severity in animal models. Thus, Delta induces robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis and more disease severity. Z-RNA/ZBP1–induced necroptosis is an initiating cell death event that occurs markedly more with Delta than Omicron infection. Editor’s summary SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers multiple cell death pathways that contribute to disease severity. Here, Liang et al. characterized cell death mechanisms in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing cells and primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in autopsied lungs from patients with COVID-19. Necroptosis was the primary form of cell death and was induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP-1). Infected and bystander cells underwent apoptosis, but limiting dilution analysis showed that apoptosis was a bystander effect. The Delta variant induced much greater Z-RNA/ZBP-1 interactions and necroptosis compared with Omicron, thus suggesting a mechanism associated with greater disease severity (see related Focus by Wong and Perlman). —Christiana N.

        <tr id="Immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet the demands associated with immune responses. The effects of aging on these pathways and on the metabolic phenotype of the immune cells participating in antibody responses to vaccines are still largely unknown. Here we used a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 that utilizes the cellular heat shock chaperone glycoprotein 96 (gp96), engineered to co-express SARS-CoV-2 Spike (spike) protein (gp96-Ig-S). Results show that this vaccine induces comparable B cell primary responses in young and old mice at later time points, but a significantly lesser secondary response in old as compared to young mice, with the antibodies generated in the secondary response being also of lower avidity. This occurs because aging changes the B cell metabolic phenotype and induces hyper-metabolic B cells that are associated with higher intrinsic inflammation and decreased protective antibody responses. However, the gp96-Ig-S vaccine was found to be effective in significantly reducing the metabolic/inflammatory status of B cells from old mice, suggesting the possibility that targeting metabolic pathways may improve immune function in old mice that do not respond adequately to the vaccine.">

        <tr id="The effects of immunodeficiency associated with chronic HIV infection on COVID-19 disease and viral persistence have not been directly addressed in a controlled setting. In this pilot study, we exposed two pigtail macaques (PTMs) chronically infected with SIVmac239, exhibiting from very low to no CD4 T cells across all compartments, to SARS-CoV-2. We monitored the disease progression, viral replication, and evolution, and compared these outcomes with SIV-naïve PTMs infected with SARS-CoV-2. No overt signs of COVID-19 disease were observed in either animal, and the SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and evolution in the SIVmac239 PTMs were indistinguishable from those in the SIV-naïve PTMs in all sampled mucosal sites. However, the single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells revealed an infiltration of functionally inert monocytes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Critically, neither of the SIV-infected PTMs mounted detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses nor anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding or neutralizing antibodies. Thus, HIV-induced immunodeficiency alone may not be sufficient to drive the emergence of novel viral variants but may remove the ability of infected individuals to mount adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is characterized by its high transmissibility, which has caused a worldwide epidemiological event. Yet, it turns ominous once the disease progression degenerates into severe pneumonia and sepsis, presenting a horrendous lethality. To elucidate the alveolar immune or inflammatory landscapes of Omicron critical-ill patients, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with critical pneumonia caused by Omicron infection, and analyzed the correlation between the clinical severity scores and different immune cell subpopulations. In the BALF of Omicron critical patients, the alveolar violent myeloid inflammatory environment was determined. ISG15+ neutrophils and CXCL10+ macrophages, both expressed the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), were negatively correlated with clinical pulmonary infection score, while septic CST7+ neutrophils and inflammatory VCAN+ macrophages were positively correlated with sequential organ failure assessment. The percentages of ISG15+ neutrophils were associated with more protective alveolar epithelial cells, and may reshape CD4+ T cells to the exhaustive phenotype, thus preventing immune injuries. The CXCL10+ macrophages may promote plasmablast/plasma cell survival and activation as well as the production of specific antibodies. As compared to the previous BALF scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 wild-type/Alpha critical patients, the subsets of neutrophils and macrophages with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features presented obvious distinctions, suggesting an immune disparity in Omicron variants. Overall, this study provides a BALF single-cell atlas of Omicron critical patients, and suggests that alveolar interferon-responsive neutrophils and macrophages may extricate SARS-CoV-2 Omicron critical patients from the nasty fate of sepsis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) preferentially infects the respiratory tract; however, several studies have implicated a multi-organ involvement. Hepatic dysfunctions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been increasingly recognized and described to correlate with disease severity. To elucidate molecular factors that could contribute towards hepatic infection, we concentrated on microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that modulate various cellular processes and which are reported to be differentially regulated during liver injury. We aimed to study the infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) with SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the potential of miRNAs for modulating viral infection.


METHODS
We analysed liver autopsies from a coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-positive cohort for the presence of viral RNA using Nanopore sequencing. PHH were used for the infection with SARS-CoV-2. The candidate miRNAs targeting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were identified using in silico approaches. To discover the potential regulatory mechanism, transfection experiments, qRT-PCRs, western blots and luciferase reporter assays were performed.


RESULTS
We could detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19-positive liver autopsies. We show that PHH express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and can be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulting in robust replication. Transfection of selected miRNA mimics reduced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression and SARS-CoV-2 burden in PHH. In silico and biochemical analyses supported a potential direct binding of miR-141-3p to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.


CONCLUSION
We confirm that PHH are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate selected miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and/or the viral genome reduce viral loads. These data provide novel insights into hepatic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and associated dysfunctions in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains an international health problem caused by the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of May 2024, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths globally. Despite current vaccination programs, infections are still rapidly increasing, mainly due to the appearance and spread of new variants, variations in immunization rates, and limitations of current vaccines in preventing transmission. This underscores the need for pan-variant antivirals and treatments. The interferon (IFN) system is a critical element of the innate immune response and serves as a frontline defense against viruses. It induces a generalized antiviral state by transiently upregulating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To gain a deeper comprehension of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, its connection to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and the potential therapeutic implications, this review provides a detailed overview of fundamental aspects of the diverse ISGs identified for their antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. It emphasizes the importance of these proteins in controlling viral replication and spread. Furthermore, we explore methodological approaches for the identification of ISGs and conduct a comparative analysis with other viruses. Deciphering the roles of ISGs and their interactions with viral pathogens can help identify novel targets for antiviral therapies and enhance our preparedness to confront current and future viral threats.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, is known to infect people of all ages and both sexes. Senior populations have the greatest risk of severe COVID-19, and sexual dimorphism in clinical outcomes has been reported. Neurological symptoms are widely observed in COVID-19 patients, with many survivors exhibiting persistent neurological and cognitive impairment. The present study aims to investigate the impact of age and sex on the neuroinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a mouse model. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.351, a variant known to infect mice. Older male mice exhibited a significantly greater weight loss and higher viral loads in the lung at 3 days post infection. Notably, no viral RNA was detected in the brains of infected mice. Nevertheless, expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and CCL-2 in the lung and brain increased with viral infection. RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of brains showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused significant changes in gene expression profiles, implicating innate immunity, defense response to virus, and cerebrovascular and neuronal functions. These findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a neuroinflammatory response, despite the lack of detectable virus in the brain. Aberrant activation of innate immune response, disruption of blood-brain barrier and endothelial cell integrity, and suppression of neuronal activity and axonogenesis underlie the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain. Understanding the role of these affected pathways in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis helps identify appropriate points of therapeutic interventions to alleviate neurological dysfunction observed during COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) is a common human neurotropic virus with the majority of adults harboring latent-recurrent infections. In rare cases, HSV-1 infection can access the central nervous system through the neuronal route and develop into life-threatening encephalitis. Here, we used a mouse model for HSV-1 infection to describe the transcriptomic profile of the infected brain stem at the single-cell level and with temporal resolution. Among resident brain cells, microglia increased in proportion during the course of infection, while astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cell levels decrease. At the levels of peripheral immune cells, we found notably monocytes to strongly influx the infected brain. Large dynamic changes were found in the abundance of subpopulations of the different cell types following virus infection. For instance, we identify one subpopulation of microglia exhibiting very high type I interferon and chemokine expression early during infection. This population was also enriched for viral transcripts, suggesting localization at foci of infection, and orchestrating recruitment of other immune cells. In contrast, for the infiltrating monocytes, we identified a larger panel of unique subpopulations with antiviral and inflammatory phenotypes, and found not all of these being highly positive for viral transcripts, thus indicating monocyte activities beyond the infected brain areas. Finally, investigation of endothelial cell cross-talk with other cell types revealed that cytokines derived from microglia and monocyte, but also T cells, contribute to disturbance of the blood brain barrier. Our work thus reveals for the first time the complex nature of the cellular response in the virus-infected brain, which seeks to eliminate infection but can also prime for pathological changes.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal outbreaks of other respiratory viruses highlight the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals to treat respiratory tract infections. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a key component of innate immune signaling and plays a critical role in protection of the host against viral infections. Previously the STING agonist diABZI-4, a diamidobenzimidazole-based compound, demonstrated protection against SARS-CoV-2 both in vitro and in vivo. However, its broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other respiratory viruses in human airway epithelial cells, which are the primary targets of these infections, is not well established. In this study, we demonstrated that diABZI-4 stimulated robust innate immune responses protecting lung cells against a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), common cold coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, human rhinovirus (HRV), and human parainfluenza virus. diABZI-4 was highly active in physiologically relevant human airway epithelial tissues grown at the air-liquid interface, blocking replication of IAV, SARS-CoV-2, and HRV in these tissues. Furthermore, treatment of macrophages with diABZI-4 resulted in the secretion of cytokines that protected the primary airway epithelial cells from IAV infection. Despite the promising in vitro pan-antiviral activity, intranasal administration of diABZI-4 in mice provided early, but not sustained, inhibition of IAV replication in the lungs. These data highlight the complexities of the relationship between timing of STING agonist-driven inflammatory responses and viral replication dynamics, emphasizing the development challenge posed by STING agonists as potential therapeutics against respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Coronaviruses constitute a significant threat to the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2, is a highly pathogenic human coronavirus that has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It has led to a global viral outbreak with an exceptional spread and a high death toll, highlighting the need for effective antiviral strategies. 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), the main protease in SARS-CoV-2, plays an indispensable role in the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle by cleaving the viral polyprotein to produce 11 individual non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication. 3CLpro is one of two proteases that function to produce new viral particles. It is a highly conserved cysteine protease with identical structural folds in all known human coronaviruses. Inhibitors binding with high affinity to 3CLpro will prevent the cleavage of viral polyproteins, thus impeding viral replication. Multiple strategies have been implemented to screen for inhibitors against 3CLpro, including peptide-like and small molecule inhibitors that covalently and non-covalently bind the active site, respectively. In addition, allosteric sites of 3CLpro have been identified to screen for small molecules that could make non-competitive inhibitors of 3CLpro. In essence, this review serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the structural intricacies and functional dynamics of 3CLpro, emphasizing key findings that elucidate its role as the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the review is a critical resource in recognizing the advancements in identifying and developing 3CLpro inhibitors as effective antiviral strategies against COVID-19, some of which are already approved for clinical use in COVID-19 patients.">

While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the other 40% of patients experience a range of symptoms, from self-limiting pneumonia to life-threatening disseminated disease. The immunological events that underlie the progression to severe disease remain under defined. Here, we probed the early immune response to Coccidioides using a high dose of an attenuated strain of C. posadasii in a mouse model of infection coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing. At 24 hours post-infection, robust immune infiltration is detected in the lung, marked by high levels of inflammatory PD-L1+ neutrophils and fungal-contact dependent pro-fibrotic Spp1+ macrophages. These findings elucidate the early dynamics of the host response to Coccidioides and provide a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the lung. Importance By examining early immune dynamics in the lungs, we uncover critical insights into how myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, are recruited and differentiated during Coccidioides infection. The discovery of specific immune cell subsets, such as PD-L1+ neutrophils and Spp1+ macrophages, which are associated with inflammation and fibrosis, highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the subsequent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised questions about its impact on pediatric asthma. This review analyzes the latest research to offer a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between COVID-19 and pediatric asthma.


AREAS COVERED
This narrative review examines the effects of COVID-19 on pediatric asthma, exploring clinical outcomes, immune responses, recommended treatments, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and COVID-19 vaccination. Data were sourced from databases (PubMed, Embase, and BioRxiv/MedRxiv) from January 2020 to November 2023.


EXPERT OPINION
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the international scientific community rapidly developed extensive knowledge, demonstrating unprecedented cooperation. Despite these advances, questions remain about SARS-CoV-2 infection and pediatric asthma. Most research consists of epidemiological studies with varying methods, sometimes yielding contradictory results. While asthma generally did not increase the risk of severe COVID-19 in children, uncontrolled asthma was a risk factor, highlighting the importance of maintaining asthma management. Telemedicine has proven effective for asthma control and will continue to grow, despite its limitations. Notably, allergic asthma may have a protective role against severe COVID-19. We recommend COVID-19 vaccination in the pediatric age group, including those with asthma.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against β-coronaviruses (β-CoVs), a family of viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2. Viral sensing via pattern recognition receptors triggers inflammation and cell death, which are essential components of the innate immune response that facilitate viral clearance. However, excessive activation of the innate immune system and inflammatory cell death can result in uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in cytokine storm and pathology. PANoptosis, innate immune, inflammatory cell death initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes, has been implicated in the pathology of viral infections. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PANoptosis in response to β-CoV infection is critical for identifying new therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease severity. In the current study, we analyzed findings from a cell death-based CRISPR screen with archetypal β-CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as the trigger to characterize host molecules required for inflammatory cell death. As a result, we identified SMARCA4, a chromatin regulator, as a putative host factor required for PANoptosis in response to MHV. Furthermore, we observed that gRNA-mediated deletion of Smarca4 inhibited MHV-induced PANoptotic cell death in macrophages. These findings have potential translational and clinical implications for the advancement of treatment strategies for β-CoVs and other infections.">

        <tr id="The unprecedented research effort associated with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) included several extensive proteomic studies that identified host proteins that interact with individual viral gene products. However, in most cases, the consequences of those virus–host interactions for virus replication were not experimentally pursued, which is a necessary step in determining whether the interactions represent pro- or anti-viral events. One putative interaction commonly identified in multiple studies was between the host adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) subunit B1 (AP3B1) and the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E). AP3B1 is one subunit of AP-3 required for the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles (LROs), and its function impacts important disease processes including inflammation and vascular health. Thus, interactions between AP3B1 and SARS-CoV-2 might influence the clinical outcomes of infection. To determine if AP3B1 has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, we first confirmed the interaction in virus-infected cells using immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). AP3B1 is required by multiple viruses to aid in the replication cycle and therefore may be a therapeutic target. However, we found that the overexpression of AP3B1 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas the siRNA-mediated depletion of AP3B1 increased the release of infectious virus, suggesting an antiviral role for AP3B1. Together, our findings suggest that AP3B1 is an intrinsic barrier to SARS-CoV-2 replication through interactions with the viral E protein. Our work justifies further investigations of LRO trafficking in SARS-CoV-2 target cells and their role in viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19, acute and long term, suggest SARS-CoV-2 affects both the peripheral and central nervous systems (PNS/CNS). Although studies have shown olfactory and hematogenous invasion into the CNS, coinciding with neuroinflammation, little attention has been paid to susceptibility of the PNS to infection or to its contribution to CNS invasion. Here we show that sensory and autonomic neurons in the PNS are susceptible to productive infection with SARS-CoV-2 and outline physiological and molecular mechanisms mediating neuroinvasion. Our infection of K18-hACE2 mice, wild-type mice, and golden Syrian hamsters, as well as primary peripheral sensory and autonomic neuronal cultures, show viral RNA, proteins, and infectious virus in PNS neurons, satellite glial cells, and functionally connected CNS tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate, in vitro, that neuropilin-1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 neuronal entry. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly invades the PNS prior to viremia, establishes a productive infection in peripheral neurons, and results in sensory symptoms often reported by COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The first approved vaccines for human use against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are nanotechnology-based. Although they are modular, rapidly produced, and can reduce disease severity, the currently available vaccines are restricted in preventing infection, stressing the global demand for novel preventive vaccine technologies. Bearing this in mind, we set out to develop a flexible nanovaccine platform for nasal administration to induce mucosal immunity, which is fundamental for optimal protection against respiratory virus infection. The next-generation multiepitope nanovaccines co-deliver immunogenic peptides, selected by an immunoinformatic workflow, along with adjuvants and regulators of the PD-L1 expression. As a case study, we focused on SARS-CoV-2 peptides as relevant antigens to validate the approach. This platform can evoke both local and systemic cellular- and humoral-specific responses against SARS-CoV-2. This led to the secretion of immunoglobulin A (IgA), capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, following a heterologous immunization strategy. Considering the limitations of the required cold chain distribution for current nanotechnology-based vaccines, it is shown that the lyophilized nanovaccine is stable for long-term at room temperature and retains its in vivo efficacy upon reconstitution. This makes it particularly relevant for developing countries and offers a modular system adaptable to future viral threats.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to life-threatening clinical manifestations. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at higher risk for severe courses of COVID-19. So far, however, there are hardly any strategies for predicting the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CVD patients at hospital admission. Thus, we investigated whether this prediction is achievable by prospectively analysing the blood immunophenotype of 94 nonvaccinated participants, including uninfected and acutely SARS-CoV-2-infected CVD patients and healthy donors, using a 36-colour spectral flow cytometry panel. Unsupervised data analysis revealed little differences between healthy donors and CVD patients, whereas the distribution of the cell populations changed dramatically in SARS-CoV-2-infected CVD patients. The latter had more mature NK cells, activated monocyte subsets, central memory CD4+ T cells, and plasmablasts but fewer dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, innate lymphoid cells, and CD8+ T-cell subsets. Moreover, we identified an immune signature characterised by CD161+ T cells, intermediate effector CD8+ T cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells that is predictive for CVD patients with a severe course of COVID-19. Thus, intensified immunophenotype analyses can help identify patients at risk of severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, improving clinical outcomes through specific treatment.">

        <tr id="Understanding the pathophysiology of long COVID is one of the most intriguing challenges confronting contemporary medicine. Despite observations recently made in the relevant molecular, cellular, and physiological domains, it is still difficult to say whether the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 directly correspond to the consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This work hypothesizes that neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) production are at the interconnection of three positive feedback loops which are initiated in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and which involve inflammation, immunothrombosis, and autoimmunity. This phenomenon could be favored by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 may directly bind and penetrate neutrophils. The ensuing strong neutrophil stimulation leads to a progressive amplification of an exacerbated and uncontrolled NETs production, potentially persisting for months beyond the acute phase of infection. This continuous self-stimulation of neutrophils leads, in turn, to systemic inflammation, micro-thromboses, and the production of autoantibodies, whose significant consequences include the persistence of endothelial and multiorgan damage, and vascular complications.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a pandemic and contributes to long-lasting morbidity. Several studies have investigated immediate cellular and humoral immune responses during acute infection. However, little is known about long-term effects of COVID-19 on the immune system.


METHODS
We performed a longitudinal investigation of cellular and humoral immune parameters in 106 non-vaccinated subjects ten weeks (10 w) and ten months (10 m) after their first SARS-CoV-2 infection. Peripheral blood immune cells were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry, serum cytokines were examined by multiplex technology. Antibodies specific for the Spike protein (S), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the nucleocapsid protein (NC) were determined. All parameters measured 10 w and 10 m after infection were compared with those of a matched, noninfected control group (n = 98).


RESULTS
Whole blood flow cytometric analyses revealed that 10 m after COVID-19, convalescent patients compared to controls had reduced absolute granulocyte, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts, involving T, B, and NK cells, in particular CD3+CD45RA+CD62L+CD31+ recent thymic emigrant T cells and non-class-switched CD19+IgD+CD27+ memory B cells. Cellular changes were associated with a reversal from Th1- to Th2-dominated serum cytokine patterns. Strong declines of NC- and S-specific antibody levels were associated with younger age (by 10.3 years, p < .01) and fewer CD3-CD56+ NK and CD19+CD27+ B memory cells. Changes of T-cell subsets at 10 m such as normalization of effector and Treg numbers, decline of RTE, and increase of central memory T cell numbers were independent of antibody decline pattern.


CONCLUSIONS
COVID-19 causes long-term reduction of innate and adaptive immune cells which is associated with a Th2 serum cytokine profile. This may provide an immunological mechanism for long-term sequelae after COVID-19.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) remain a significant global cause of mortality and disability. Viruses constitute a substantial proportion of LRTI cases, with their pandemic potential posing a latent threat. After the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the resurgence of other respiratory viruses, including Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus responsible for LRTI has been observed especially in susceptible populations.


AREAS COVERED
This review details the inflammatory mechanisms associated with three primary respiratory viruses: SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The focus will be on elucidating the activation of inflammatory pathways, understanding cellular contributions to inflammation, exploring the role of interferon and induced cell death in the response to these pathogens and detailing viral evasion mechanisms. Furthermore, the distinctive characteristics of each virus will be explained.


EXPERT OPINION
The study of viral pneumonia, notably concerning SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and RSV, offers critical insights into infectious and inflammatory mechanisms with wide-ranging implications. Addressing current limitations, such as diagnostic accuracy and understanding host-virus interactions, requires collaborative efforts and investment in technology. Future research holds promise for uncovering novel therapeutic targets, exploring host microbiome roles, and addressing long-term sequelae. Integrating advances in molecular biology and technology will shape the evolving landscape of viral pneumonia research, potentially enhancing global public health outcomes.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable respiratory virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Since its emergence in the early 2000s, SARS has posed significant public health challenges and continues to be a concern. This review provides an overview of current treatment strategies for SARS-CoV and explores the potential utility of herbal molecules in combating this viral infection. The primary treatment approach for SARS-CoV has historically centered on supportive care, which includes oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and antipyretic medications to manage symptoms. However, with the ongoing advancement of medical research and our evolving understanding of the virus, several antiviral drugs have been developed and repurposed to target SARS-CoV. Recent developments in the field of herbal medicine have drawn attention to the potential efficacy of natural compounds in the management of viral infections, including SARS. Herbal molecules, characterized by their diverse bioactive constituents, exhibit antiviral properties that could be harnessed to mitigate SARS symptoms and inhibit viral replication. Ocimum sanctum, Tinospora cordifolia, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Panax ginseng, and Aloe vera have been identified for their immunomodulatory effects. This review highlights promising herbal molecules such as quercetin, and curcumin, which have demonstrated antiviral effects in–vitro and in some preclinical studies. While current treatment strategies for SARS primarily rely on supportive care and antiviral medications, the exploration of herbal molecules presents an exciting avenue for potential adjunctive therapies. Further research is required to validate their efficacy, safety profiles, and mechanisms of action. A holistic approach that combines conventional medicine with herbal remedies may offer new insights into the treatment of SARS and other viral respiratory illnesses.">

Released extracellular vesicles carry virus-specific receptors that increase the sensitivity of the target cells to viral infection. Exosomes may contribute to the systemic spreading of SARS-CoV-2 virus by transferring essential receptors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and CD9 that promote the ability of the virus to dock into the target cells. Subsequently, the SARS-CoV-2 virus might also enter into the exosomal pathway to use this system for packaging their components into exosomes for secretion. This study suggests that one of the potential explanations for the relapse and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection could be an endocytic transport pathway related to the secretion of COVID-19-loaded extracellular vesicles.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 epidemic has already come to be seen as an emergency of international concern. This relates not only to the wide occurrence of the infection, but also to a fairly high mortality rate, currently more than 6.5 million deaths in the world.
The aim of this study was to analyze, generalize and systematize the currently available literary data on the study of the novel coronavirus infection pathogenesis in the human body and to determine key changes that occur after the SARS-CoV-2 penetration into cells. In this way to target physicians primarily based on the pathogenetic processes that occur in the human body, syndromes and symptom complexes that are observed in treatments.
Results. The article presents a literature review demonstrating that the specific interaction between the virus and somatic cells is the triggering mechanism for the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection. The main route for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the body is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed not only in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells, but also in cells of the kidney, heart, blood vessels and gastrointestinal tract, including endotheliocytes and pericytes. Expression of the ACE2 receptor has also been shown in various structures and parts of the brain, cells of the conjunctiva, limbus, cornea and cells of the substantia propria. A high expression of the ACE2 receptor has been found in the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa, salivary glands, tonsils and tongue. These factors explain a possible involvement of different organs and systems in the development of multiorgan failure.
Conclusions. In the development of multiorgan disfunction, two components are important: first, direct cell tropism and viral load, that may be unique in each patient. Secondly, it is the development of immune-mediated reactions to infected cells. Under conditions of hyperimmune inflammation, that is, the development of cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome progresses, and multiple organ failure develops. Endothelial damage is directly involved in the pathophysiology of this process, that results in the development of endothelial dysfunction, disruption of microcirculation, as well as perivascular inflammation, which aggravates damage to the endothelium and can lead to thrombus formation.
The use of modern knowledge about the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 would help to estimate the risk for severe infection and the possible development of complications, allowing for the timely implementation of effective pathogenetic therapy.">

        <tr id="Significance Early in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, severe multisystem inflammatory responses were observed in children. Symptoms of this condition resembled superantigen poisoning, which results in indiscriminate T cell activation via antigen-independent binding of superantigens to T cell receptors (TCRs). Sequence similarities between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a bacterial superantigen led to the hypothesis that the spike protein could act as a superantigen. Although supported by structural modeling, this hypothesis has not yet found direct experimental support. Here, we studied the potential interaction of the spike protein with TCRs. With orthogonal biochemical and biological methods, we did not detect a spike-TCR molecular interaction. We conclude that it is unlikely that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein engages nonspecifically with TCRs or has superantigenic character.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a significant public health threat, particularly in children and older adults, with high mortality rates. Some of these pathogens are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza viruses (IV), human parvovirus B19 (B19V), and human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1). These viruses cause various respiratory symptoms, including cough, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Notably, these viruses can also impact the central nervous system (CNS), leading to acute manifestations such as seizures, encephalopathies, encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and long-term complications. The precise mechanisms by which these viruses affect the CNS are not fully understood. Glial cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes within the CNS, play pivotal roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and regulating immune responses. Exploring how these cells interact with viral pathogens, such as hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IVs, B19V, and HBoV1, offers crucial insights into the significant impact of respiratory viruses on the CNS. This review article examines hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IV, B19V, and HBoV1 interactions with microglia and astrocytes, shedding light on potential neurological consequences.">

Advancement of proteomic and metabolomic studies now allows deeper investigation of alterations to cellular metabolism, autophagic processes and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, while computational biology and machine learning have advanced methodologies of predicting virus–host gene and protein interactions. Particular focus is given to the interaction between viral genes and proteins with mitochondrial function and that of the innate immune system. Finally, the authors hypothesise that viral persistence may be a function of mitochondrial involvement in the sequestration of viral genetic material.

        <tr id="While SARS-CoV-2 has transitioned to an endemic phase, infections caused by newly emerged variants continue to result in severe, and sometimes fatal, outcomes or lead to long-term COVID-19 symptoms. Vulnerable populations, such as PLWH, face an elevated risk of severe illness. Emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, including numerous Omicron subvariants, are increasingly associated with breakthrough infections. Adapting mRNA vaccines to these new variants may offer improved protection against Omicron for vulnerable individuals. In this study, we examined humoral and cellular immune responses before and after administering adapted booster vaccinations to PLWH, alongside a control group of healthy individuals. Four weeks following booster vaccination, both groups exhibited a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses. Notably, there was no significant difference in humoral immune response between PLWH and the healthy controls. Immune responses declined rapidly in both groups three months post vaccination. However, PLWH still showed significantly increased neutralizing antibody titers even after three months. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of the adapted vaccination regimen. The results suggest that regular booster immunizations may be necessary to sustain protective immunity.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the generation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector and memory T cells. However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces pneumonia and acute respiratory failure in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with inborn errors of immunity to type I interferon (IFN-I). The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies widely, ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to life-threatening illness and organ failure, with a higher incidence in men than in women. Approximately 3 to 5% of critical COVID-19 patients under 60 and a smaller percentage of elderly patients exhibit genetic defects in IFN-I production, including X-chromosome-linked TLR7 and autosomal TLR3 deficiencies. Around 15 to 20% of cases over 70 years old, and a smaller percentage of younger patients, present with preexisting autoantibodies neutralizing type I interferons. Additionally, innate errors affecting the control of the response to type I interferon have been associated with pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Several studies have described rare errors of immunity, such as XIAP deficiency, CYBB, SOCS1, OAS1/2, and RNASEL, as underlying factors in MIS-C susceptibility. However, further investigations in expanded patient cohorts are needed to validate these findings and pave the way for new genetic approaches to MIS-C. This review aims to present recent evidence from the scientific literature on genetic and immunological abnormalities predisposing individuals to critical SARS-CoV-2 infection through IFN-I. We will also discuss multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Understanding the immunological mechanisms and pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 may inform personalized patient care and population protection strategies against future serious viral infections.">

        <tr id="The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and enduring impact, resulting in substantial loss of life. The scientific community has responded unprecedentedly by investigating various aspects of the crisis, particularly focusing on the acute phase of COVID-19. The roles of the viral load, cytokines, and chemokines during the acute phase and in the context of patients who experienced enduring symptoms upon infection, so called Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 or PASC, have been studied extensively. Here, in this review, we offer a virologist’s perspective on PASC, highlighting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, cytokines, and chemokines in different organs of patients across the full clinical spectrum of acute-phase disease. We underline that the probability of severe or critical disease progression correlates with increased viral load levels detected in the upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT), and plasma. Acute-phase viremia is a clear, although not unambiguous, predictor of PASC development. Moreover, both the quantity and diversity of functions of cytokines and chemokines increase with acute-phase disease severity. Specific cytokines remain or become elevated in the PASC phase, although the driving factor of ongoing inflammation found in patients with PASC remains to be investigated. The key findings highlighted in this review contribute to a further understanding of PASC and their differences and overlap with acute disease.">

While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the symptomatic 40% are often misdiagnosed due to similarities with bronchitis or pneumonia. A small subset of infection progress to severe illness, necessitating a better understanding of immune responses during lethal infection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we characterized lung responses during Coccidioides infection. We identified monocyte-derived Spp1-expressing macrophages as potential mediators of tissue remodeling and fibrosis, marked by high expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory transcripts. These macrophages showed elevated TGF-β and IL-6 signaling, pathways involved in fibrosis pathogenesis. Additionally, we observed significant neutrophil infiltration and defective lymphocyte responses, indicating severe adaptive immunity dysregulation in lethal, acute infection. These findings enhance our understanding of Coccidioides infection and suggest new therapeutic targets.

We have previously shown that innate immune cells play a critical role in controlling SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the innate immune response during breakthrough infections, we modeled breakthrough infections by challenging low-dose vaccinated mice with a vaccine-mismatched SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. We found that low-dose vaccinated infected mice had a 2-log reduction in lung viral burden, but increased immune cell infiltration in the lung parenchyma, characterized by monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and eosinophils. Single cell RNA-seq revealed viral RNA was highly associated with eosinophils that corresponded to a unique IFN-γ biased signature. Antibody-mediated depletion of eosinophils in vaccinated mice resulted in increased virus replication and dissemination in the lungs, demonstrating that eosinophils in the lungs are protective during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. These results highlight the critical role for the innate immune response in vaccine mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Novel coronavirus disease 2019, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, initiate humoral and cellular immune responses against diverse virus antigens. The assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific is mainly carried out in routine practice by determining specific immunoglobulins. However, high variability in S-protein structure in new genovariants of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the lack of correlation between specific antibodies and CD8+ T-lymphocytes underlie false negative responses, and mass assessment of cellular immunity is complicated due to the complexity of applying ELISPOT and cytofluorometry techniques. To solve this issue, a diagnostic method was developed for assessing SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immune response, which is based on a skin test followed by evaluating a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction involving antigen-specific memory T-lymphocytes. A diagnostic preparation CoronaDerm-PS is based on Cord_PS, which is a hybrid recombinant protein consisting of parts of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, M, N, E. The specific activity of this chimeric antigen was analyzed in cultured T-lymphocyte activation test by assessing interferon-γ production using cytofluorometry. To investigate the chimeric antigen specific activity, a preclinical safety study with CoronaDerm-PS preparation in experimental animals was conducted. A dose-dependent developing skin reaction was observed in 90–100% of guinea pigs vaccinated by EpiVacCorona, CoviVac, Gam-COVID-Vac, which confirms a potential for assessing post-vaccination cellular immunity using CoronaDerm-PS preparation. Upon this, the presence of functionally active T-cell-antigenic epitopes in the recombinant polypeptide allows to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific response illustrated by detected response after Gam-COVID-Vac (S-protein) and EpiVacCorona (N-protein) vaccination. Thus, a skin test based on CoronaDerm-PS preparation may be a promising diagnostic tool for rapid mass screening requiring no specialized laboratory equipment for assessing populational SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Such a test is distinguished by advantages such as ease of analysis, high specificity and sensitivity. The final decision-making on using this test in a real-world practice may achieved after conducting further clinical safety and effectiveness trials.">

This study aimed to evaluate the role and developmental pathway of atypical memory B cells (MBCs) in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The results revealed a proinflammatory signature across B cell subsets associated with disease severity, as evidenced by the upregulation of genes such as GADD45B, MAP3K8, and NFKBIA in critical and severe individuals. Furthermore, the analysis of atypical MBCs suggested a developmental pathway similar to that of conventional MBCs through germinal centers, as indicated by the expression of several genes involved in germinal center processes, including CXCR4, CXCR5, BCL2, and MYC. Additionally, the upregulation of genes characteristic of the immune response in COVID-19, such as ZFP36 and DUSP1, suggested that the differentiation and activation of atypical MBCs may be influenced by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and that these genes may contribute to the immune response for COVID-19 recovery.

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can increase the risk of neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegenerative diseases. Certain IAV strains, such as avian H7N7 subtype, possess neurotropic properties, enabling them to directly invade the brain parenchyma and infect neurons and glia cells. Host sex significantly influences the severity of IAV infections. Studies indicate that females of the reproductive age exhibit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses to IAVs compared to males. This heightened immune response correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, and potential neuronal damage in females. Understanding the sex-specific neurotropism of IAV and associated mechanisms leading to adverse neurological outcomes is essential. Our study reveals that primary hippocampal cultures from female mice show heightened interferon-β and pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion following neurotropic IAV infection. We observed sex-specific differences in microglia activation: both sexes showed a transition into a hyper-ramified state, but only male-derived microglia exhibited an increase in amoeboid-shaped cells. These disparities extended to alterations in neuronal morphology. Neurons derived from female mice displayed increased spine density within 24 h post-infection, while no significant change was observed in male cultures. This aligns with sex-specific differences in microglial synaptic pruning. Data suggest that amoeboid-shaped microglia preferentially target postsynaptic terminals, potentially reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Conversely, hyper-ramified microglia may focus on presynaptic terminals, potentially limiting viral spread. In conclusion, our findings underscore the utility of primary hippocampal cultures, incorporating microglia, as an effective model to study sex-specific, virus-induced effects on brain-resident cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease and has been clinically associated with neurological complications. However, there is a lack of relevant models to elucidate the neuropathology of EV-A71 and its mechanism, as the current models mainly utilize animal models or immortalized cell lines. In this study, we established a human motor neuron model for EV-A71 infection. Single cell transcriptomics of a mixed neuronal population reveal higher viral RNA load in motor neurons, suggesting higher infectivity and replication of EV-A71 in motor neurons. The elevated RNA load in motor neurons correlates with the downregulation of ferritin-encoding genes. Subsequent analysis confirms that neurons infected with EV-A71 undergo ferroptosis, as evidenced by increased levels of labile Fe2+ and peroxidated lipids. Notably, the Fe2+ chelator Deferoxamine improves mitochondrial function and promotes survival of motor neurons by 40% after EV-A71 infection. These findings deepen understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of EV-A71 infection, providing insights which suggest that improving mitochondrial respiration and inhibition of ferroptosis can mitigate the impact of EV-A71 infection in the central nervous system.">

        <tr id="Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 diseases, can impact different tissues and induce significant cellular alterations. The production of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are physiologically involved in cell communication, is also altered during COVID-19, along with the dysfunction of cytoplasmic organelles. Since circulating EVs reflect the state of their cells of origin, they represent valuable tools for monitoring pathological conditions. Despite challenges in detecting EVs due to their size and specific cellular compartment origin using different methodologies, flow cytometry has proven to be an effective method for assessing the role of EVs in COVID-19. This review summarizes the involvement of plasmatic EVs in COVID-19 patients and individuals with Long COVID (LC) affected by post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), highlighting their dual role in exerting both pro- and antiviral effects. We also emphasize how flow cytometry, with its multiparametric approach, can be employed to characterize circulating EVs, particularly in infectious diseases such as COVID-19, and suggest their potential role in chronic impairments during post-infection.">

COVID-19 has taught us that the development of vaccines, repurposing of drugs, and understanding the mechanism of a disease can be done within a short time. The COVID-19 proteomics and metabolomics has contributed to its diagnosis, understanding of its progression, host-virus interaction, disease mechanism, and also in the search of suitable anti-COVID therapeutics. Mass spectrometry based proteomics was used to find the potential biomarkers of different stages of COVID-19 including severe and nonsevere cases in the blood serum. Notably, protein-protein interaction techniques to understand host-virus interactions were also significantly useful. The single-cell proteomics studies were carried out to ascertain the changes in immune cell composition and its activation in mild COVID-19 patients versus severe COVID-19 patients using whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Modern technologies were helpful to deal with the pandemic; however, there is still scope for further development. Further, attempts were made to understand the protein-protein, metabolite-metabolite, and protein-metabolite interactomes, derived from proteins and metabolite fingerprints of COVID-19 patients by reanalysis of COVID-19 public mass spectrometry based proteomics and metabolomics studies. Further, some of these interactions were supported by the literature as validations in the COVID-19 studies.">

Here, using human upper/lower airway and intestinal cells, we examined the previously dominant BA.1-BA.5 and BA.2.75 subvariants, together with the recently emerged XBB/BQ lineages, in comparison to the former Delta variant. We observed a tendency for each virus to demonstrate higher growth capability than the previously dominant subvariants. Unlike human bronchial and intestinal cells, nasal epithelial cells accommodated the efficient entry of certain Omicron subvariants, similar to the Delta variant. In contrast to the Delta's reliance on cell-surface transmembrane protease serine 2, all tested Omicron variants depended on endosomal cathepsin L. Moreover, S1/S2 cleavage of early Omicron spikes was less efficient, whereas recent viruses exhibit improved cleavage efficacy. Our results show that the Omicron variant progressively adapts to human cells through continuous endosome-mediated host cell entry.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, has evolved into a number of variants/subvariants, which have generated multiple global waves of infection. In order to monitor/predict virological features of emerging variants and determine appropriate strategies for anti-viral development, understanding conserved or altered features of evolving SARS-CoV-2 is important. In this study, we addressed previously or recently predominant Omicron subvariants and demonstrated the gradual adaptation to human cells. The host cell entry route, which was altered from the former Delta variant, was conserved among all tested Omicron subvariants. Collectively, this study revealed both changing and maintained features of SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron variant evolution.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections such as influenza A virus. This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a threat to public health. Current therapeutics remain limited to direct acting antivirals that lack distinct mechanisms of action and are already showing signs of viral resistance. The virus encodes an ADP-ribosylhydrolase macrodomain (Mac1) that plays an important role in the coronaviral lifecycle by suppressing host innate immune responses. Genetic inactivation of Mac1 abrogates viral replication in vivo by potentiating host innate immune responses. However, it is unknown whether this can be achieved by pharmacologic inhibition and can therefore be exploited therapeutically. Here we report a potent and selective lead small molecule, AVI-4206, that is effective in an in vivo model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cellular models indicate that AVI-4206 has high target engagement and can weakly inhibit viral replication in a gamma interferon- and Mac1 catalytic activity-dependent manner; a stronger antiviral effect for AVI-4206 is observed in human airway organoids. In an animal model of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, AVI-4206 reduces viral replication, potentiates innate immune responses, and leads to a survival benefit. Our results provide pharmacological proof of concept that Mac1 is a valid therapeutic target via a novel immune-restoring mechanism that could potentially synergize with existing therapies targeting distinct, essential aspects of the coronaviral life cycle. This approach could be more widely used to target other viral macrodomains to develop antiviral therapeutics beyond COVID-19.">

Pre-existing lung diseases adversely affect the prognosis of infected COVID-19 patients, and agricultural workers routinely exposed to inhalable organic dusts have substantial increased risk for developing chronic lung diseases. In previous studies, we characterized the protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent airway inflammation mediated by organic dust extract (ODE) derived from dust collected from swine confinement facilities in in vitro and in vivo models. Here, we studied the effect of ODE on SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infection in mice and human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). In wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor), ODE increased ACE2 shedding by ADAM-17 in the lungs. After repeated ODE treatments, the increased soluble ACE2 correlated to higher pseudovirus titer in the mouse lungs. In the human bronchial epithelial cells, ODE augmented PKCα activity in WT cells, and membrane ACE2 expression was diminished in PKCα-dominant negative cells. Unlike in the mice, increasing membrane ACE2 levels by treating with PKCα or ADAM-17 inhibitors and a low dose of ODE enhanced pseudoviral entry in vitro. Following viral entry, IL-8 secretion by the cells was diminished in a PKCα- and ADAM-17-independent manner. Together, the complex mechanisms involved in the synergistic effects of agricultural dust and SARS-CoV-2 highlight the importance of studying dust-mediated changes to immunity against circulating pathogens.">

Previous studies have shown antibody Fc effector functions are critical for optimal monoclonal antibody-mediated protection against alphaviruses; however, the requirement of Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) for protection during natural infection has not been evaluated. Here, we showed mice lacking activating FcγRs (FcRγ-/-) developed prolonged clinical disease with more virus in joint-associated tissues. Viral clearance was associated with anti-MAYV cell surface binding rather than neutralizing antibodies. Lack of Fc-FcγR engagement increased the number of monocytes through chronic timepoints. Single cell RNA sequencing showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes in joint-associated tissue with increased MAYV RNA present in FcRγ-/- monocytes and macrophages. Transfer of FcRγ-/- monocytes into wild type animals was sufficient to increase virus in joint-associated tissue. Overall, this study suggests that engagement of antibody Fc with activating FcγRs promotes protective responses during MAYV infection and prevents monocytes from being potential targets of infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Extracellular Traps (ETs) are fibers composed of chromatin and cytoplasmic proteins, which can trap and kill pathogens by the phenomenon called ETosis. They are released by neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, and can be found in semen. The aim of this presentation is to evidence of the indirect effect of SARS-CoV-2 in semen by ETs. Patients and methods: Experimental design: retrospective descriptive observational study. Semen samples from two groups were studied following WHO guidelines: 1) SARS-CoV-2 infected donors (n: 5; at 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after PCR diagnosis); 2) COVID-19 positive patients assisted in our laboratory between 2021 and 2022 (n: 70). They were observed in fresh and in Papanicolaou-stained smears by CASA and light microscopy; the presence of macrophages, spermiophages, ETs and hyperviscosity were recorded while neutrophilic concentration was calculated. Two control groups were designed: a) Patients belonging to group 2, studied before de pandemia (n: 13); b) Culture-negative semen samples (n: 28). Results: In the first group, ETs were observed in all the samples, while only 18% had leucospermia. Macrophages, spermiophages, and hyperviscosity were recorded in 68%, 27%, and 36% of the studied cases respectively. In the second group, ETs were present 100% in the acute phase (< 90 days after diagnosis) and decreased to 71% in the later stage (90 to 270 days). The trapped sperm were non-progressive motile or immotile alive or dead. No traps were found in either control group. Conclusion: In our study ETs were the most sensitive seminal marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in virus control. However, it has remained largely unclear whether NK cell mobilization in SARS-CoV-2 infections is beneficial or pathologic. To address this deficit, we employed a validated experimental NK cell depletion non-human primate (NHP) model with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant B.1.617.2 challenge. Viral loads (VL), NK cell numbers, activation, proliferation, and functional measures were evaluated in blood and tissues. In non-depleted (control) animals, infection rapidly induced NK cell expansion, activation, and increased tissue trafficking associated with VL. Strikingly, we report that experimental NK cell depletion leads to higher VL, longer duration of viral shedding, significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and overt lung damage. Overall, we find the first significant and conclusive evidence for NK cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and disease pathology. These data indicate that adjunct therapies for infection could largely benefit from NK cell-targeted approaches.">

        <tr id="The pathophysiological mechanisms of the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) remain unclear. Sex differences not only exist in the disease severity of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but also in the risk of suffering from PASC. Women have a higher risk of suffering from PASC and a longer time to resolution than men. To explore the possible immune mechanisms of PASC among non-elderly females, we mined single-cell transcriptome data from peripheral blood samples of non-elderly female patients with PASC and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with age- and gender-matched non-PASC and healthy controls available from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. By comparing the differences, we found that a CD14+ monocyte subset characterized by higher expression of signal transducers and activators of transcription 2 (STAT2) (CD14+STAT2high) was notably increased in the PASC patients compared with the non-PASC individuals. The transcriptional factor (TF) activity analysis revealed that STAT2 and IRF9 were the key TFs determining the function of CD14+STAT2high monocytes. STAT2 and IRF9 are TFs exclusively involving type I and III interferon (IFN) signaling pathways, resulting in uncontrolled IFN-I signaling activation and type I interferonopathy. Furthermore, increased expression of common interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) has also been identified in most monocyte subsets among the non-elderly female PASC patients, including IFI6, IFITM3, IFI44L, IFI44, EPSTI1, ISG15, and MX1. This study reveals a featured CD14+STAT2high monocyte associated with uncontrolled IFN-I signaling activation, which is indicative of a possible type I interferonopathy in the non-elderly female patients with PASC.">

        <tr id="Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) represent an urgent public health challenge and are estimated to affect more than 60 million individuals globally. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulated immune reactions may be linked with PASC symptoms, most investigations have primarily centered around blood-based studies, with few focusing on samples derived from affected tissues. Furthermore, clinical studies alone often provide correlative insights rather than causal mechanisms. Thus, it is essential to compare clinical samples with relevant animal models and conduct functional experiments to understand the etiology of PASC. In this study, we comprehensively compared bronchoalveolar lavage fluid single-cell RNA sequencing data derived from clinical PASC samples and a mouse model of PASC. This revealed a pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived macrophage response in respiratory PASC, as well as abnormal interactions between pulmonary macrophages and respiratory resident T cells, in both humans and mice. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) emerged as a key node mediating the immune anomalies in respiratory PASC. Neutralizing IFN-γ after the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced lung inflammation and tissue fibrosis in mice. Together, our study underscores the importance of performing comparative analysis to understand the cause of PASC and suggests that the IFN-γ signaling axis might represent a therapeutic target. Comparative scRNA-seq analysis, combined with functional experiments in an animal model, identified IFN-γ as a target for respiratory PASC. Editor’s summary The term “Long Covid” covers a myriad of symptoms that a person may experience after an acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is also referred to as postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The specific drivers of these symptoms are unclear, complicating the development of therapeutics for those suffering from this condition. Here, Li et al. used comparative analysis to interrogate a potential driver of respiratory PASC, one of the most debilitating types of PASC. The authors found that humans with respiratory PASC had evidence of an enhanced monocyte-derived macrophage response in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A similar phenotype was observed in aged C57BL/6 mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. This phenotype in mice could be reduced by anti–interferon-γ (anti–IFN-γ) treatment initiated after the resolution of acute disease, suggesting that the IFN-γ signaling pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target for humans. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="Massive infections of people with the previously unidentified SARS-CoV-2 virus have been a shock to the global healthcare system. While many studies have focused on the clinical manifestations of the disease and its treatment methods, understanding the molecular and genetic aspects of infection has proved critical to understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction. The scientists focused on issues of gene expression and their regulation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, we conducted a study of gene expression within the framework of the project «COVID-19: Scientific and technological justification of the response system to the spread of new respiratory infections, including coronavirus infection», the results of which are presented in the article [1].Hence, variations in the gene expression profiles of TLR 3 (Toll-Like receptor), TLR 7, TLR 4, ACE 2 (Angiotensing converting enzyme), TMPRSS 13 (Transmembrane serine protease), INF-Ɣ (Interferon gamma), and IL 4 (Interleukin) were discerned across all investigated cohorts, including those assessed six months post-recovery. There is a complex of pathways of immune system to defense with the infection including the involvement of toll-like receptor signaling pathways which contact of viral particles. Moreover, the surge in ACE2 expression demonstrates the multifunctional role as gates for Sars-Cov-2 to enter cells and activation of innate immunity responses. Although, the upregulation of INF-Ɣ and IL-4 as proinflammatory cytokines were contributed to the initiation and the progression of the cytokine storm.">

        <tr id="Plasmablasts are a population of short-lived B cells that appear in the circulation shortly after vaccination and during acute infection. Plasmablasts are formed from resting B lymphocytes, from which they differ in their ability to secrete antibodies, making them similar to plasma cells. Plasmablasts are terminally differentiated cells that can form at various nodes and branches of the B cell response. The plasmablast response is an indicator of the success of vaccination and also helps in predicting antibody levels after recovery or vaccination. However, the definition and classification of plasmablasts faces great experimental and theoretical difficulties. The aim of the work was to determine the characteristics of the plasmablast response during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study included patients (n = 28) with a severe form of COVID-19. Blood sampling was carried out once on the 10–18th day from the moment of hospitalization. B cells were isolated by immunomagnetic separation. Cells were phenotyped using flow cytometry. Secretion of IgM and IgG was determined by ELISpot method. B cell subsets were isolated using a cell sorter. Patients with COVID-19 had an approximately fourfold increase in total plasmablast levels compared to healthy donors. An even more pronounced excess over the negative control was observed for RBD-specific plasmablasts. In terms of their composition, plasmablasts were one third IgM⁺ cells. This distribution between B-cell BCR receptor isotypes was consistent with the primary nature of the immune response in COVID-19. Approximately a third of plasmablasts carried the CD138 antigen. CD138 marker is characteristic of the late stage of plasmablast maturation and is also found on plasma cells. The CD27+CD38⁺ population was divided according to the expression of the CD138 antigen. Using the ELISpot method, we have shown that a significant portion of circulating plasmablasts are antibody-secreting cells. Among circulating plasmablasts, both early and late plasmablasts can be distinguished, which are characterized by the absence of a surface BCR, but which carry the CD138 antigen. Determining how plasmablasts relate to other B cell populations is of paramount importance for the development of new treatments for COVID-19 and for the creation of promising vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. Many expect future coronavirus introductions into the human population. Hence, it is essential to understand the basic biology of these viruses. In natural infection, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein is co-expressed with all other viral proteins, which modify cellular compartments to maximize virion assembly. By comparison, most of S is degraded when the protein is expressed in isolation, as in current molecular vaccines. To probe the maturation pathway of S, we redirected its maturation by fusing S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. CD81 is a defining constituent of extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes. EVs are generated in large numbers by all cells, extruded into blood and lymph, and transfer cargo between cells and systemically (estimated 1012 EVs per mL plasma). EVs, like platelets, can be transfused between unrelated donors. When fusing the proline-stabilized form of strain Delta S into the flexible, large extracellular loop of CD81 rather than being degraded in the lysosome, S was extruded into EVs. CD81-S fusion containing EVs were produced in large numbers and could be isolated to high purity. Purified CD81::S EVs bound ACE2, and S displayed on individual EV was observed by cryogenic electron microscopy (EM). The CD81::S-fusion EVs were non-toxic and elicited an anti-S trimer and anti-RBD antibody response in mice. This report shows a design path to maximize viral glycoprotein assembly and release without relying on the co-expression of potentially pathogenic nonstructural viral proteins.


IMPORTANCE
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. To understand the maturation pathway of S, we fused S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. The resulting molecule is secreted in extracellular vesicles and induces antibodies in mice. This may be a general design path for viral glycoprotein vaccines.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The purpose was to describe the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related death and to assess the impact of the pandemic in the survival of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.


METHODS
The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization for COVID-19 and related death was assessed in ALS patients alive between March 2020 and July 2022. To evaluate its impact in the overall survival of ALS patients, the survival of patients who died before and during the pandemic was compared.


RESULTS
Amongst 263 ALS patients alive during the pandemic, 62 got infected during the study period (infection rate 14.34 per 100 person-years). Most infections (68%) occurred during the sixth wave (November 2021 to January 2022) and most patients (67%) were vaccinated at the time of infection. The hospitalization rate due to COVID-19 was 4.16 per 100 person-years. The multivariable model confirmed non-invasive ventilation (NIV) use prior to infection as a risk factor for hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 7.96, p = 0.003) and COVID-19 vaccination as a protective factor (OR = 0.093, p = 0.025) independent of age, sex and gastrostomy. Within 30 days after infection, 7% of non-ventilated patients started NIV and five patients (8.06%) died, of whom four were previously ventilated. The median survival of ALS patients was similar before and during the pandemic and no effect was found in the Cox regression model (hazard ratio 1.02, p = 0.89).


CONCLUSIONS
This study shows a high risk of severe COVID-19 amongst ALS patients requiring NIV. Nevertheless, the pandemic showed no impact in the overall survival of ALS patients, probably due to a high vaccination rate and an adequate access to healthcare resources.">

        <tr id="The lung is constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and particles that can cause alveolar damage. Hence, appropriate repair responses are essential for gas exchange and life. Here, we deciphered the spatiotemporal trajectory and function of an atypical population of macrophages after lung injury. Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Introduction The immunological characteristics that could protect children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from severe or fatal illnesses have not been fully understood yet. Methods Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on peripheral blood samples of 15 children (8 with COVID-19) and compared them to 18 adults (13 with COVID-19). Results The child-adult integrated single cell data indicated that children with the disease presented a restrained response to type I interferon in most of the major immune cell types, along with suppression of upstream interferon regulatory factor and toll-like receptor expression in monocytes, which was confirmed by in vitro interferon stimulation assays. Unlike adult patients, children with COVID-19 showed lower frequencies of activated proinflammatory CD14+ monocytes, possibly explaining the rareness of cytokine storm in them. Notably, natural killer (NK) cells in pediatric patients displayed potent cytotoxicity with a rich expression of cytotoxic molecules and upregulated cytotoxic pathways, whereas the cellular senescence, along with the Notch signaling pathway, was significantly downregulated in NK cells, all suggesting more robust cytotoxicity in NK cells of children than adult patients that was further confirmed by CD107a degranulation assays. Lastly, a modest adaptive immune response was evident with more naïve T cells but less activated and proliferated T cells while less naïve B cells but more activated B cells in children over adult patients. Conclusion Conclusively, this preliminary study revealed distinct cell frequency and activation status of major immune cell types, particularly more robust NK cell cytotoxicity in PBMC that might help protect children from severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a neurotropic member of the genus Orthoflavivirus (former Flavivirus) and is of significant health concern in Europe and Asia. TBEV pathogenesis may occur directly via virus-induced damage to neurons or through immunopathology due to excessive inflammation. While primary cells isolated from the host can be used to study the immune response to TBEV, it is still unclear how well these reflect the immune response elicited in vivo. Here, we compared the transcriptional response to TBEV and the less pathogenic tick-borne flavivirus, Langat virus (LGTV), in primary monocultures of neurons, astrocytes and microglia in vitro, with the transcriptional response in vivo captured by single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of a whole mouse cortex. We detected similar transcriptional changes induced by both LGTV and TBEV infection in vitro, with the lower response to LGTV likely resulting from slower viral kinetics. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a stronger transcriptional response in vivo than in vitro for astrocytes and microglia, with a limited overlap mainly dominated by interferon signaling. Together, this adds to our understanding of neurotropic flavivirus pathogenesis and the strengths and limitations of available model systems.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis, caused by M.tuberculosis (Mtb), remains an enduring global health challenge, especially given the limited efficacy of current therapeutic interventions. Much of existing research has focused on immune failure as a driver of tuberculosis. However, the crucial role of host macrophage biology in controlling the disease remains underappreciated. While we have gained deeper insights into how alveolar macrophages (AMs) interact with Mtb, the precise AM subsets that mediate protection and potentially prevent tuberculosis progression have yet to be identified. In this study, we employed multi-modal scRNA-seq analyses to evaluate the functional roles of diverse macrophage subpopulations across different infection timepoints, allowing us to delineate the dynamic landscape of controller and permissive AM populations during the course of infection. Our analyses at specific time-intervals post-Mtb challenge revealed macrophage populations transitioning between distinct anti- and pro-inflammatory states. Notably, early in Mtb infection, CD38− AMs showed a muted response. As infection progressed, we observed a phenotypic shift in AMs, with CD38+ monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) and a subset of tissue-resident AMs (TR-AMs) emerging as significant controllers of bacterial growth. Furthermore, scATAC-seq analysis of naïve lungs demonstrated that CD38+ TR-AMs possessed a distinct chromatin signature prior to infection, indicative of epigenetic priming and predisposition to a pro-inflammatory response. BCG intranasal immunization increased the numbers of CD38+ macrophages, substantially enhancing their capability to restrict Mtb growth. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal, dynamic roles of different macrophage subsets in TB infection and reveal rational pathways for the development of improved vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Mucosal immunity plays a crucial role in defending against coronaviruses, particularly at respiratory sites, serving as the first line of defense against viral invasion and replication. Coronaviruses have developed various immune evasion strategies at the mucosal immune system, hindering the recognition of infected cells and evading antibody responses. Understanding the immune mechanisms and responses is crucial for developing effective vaccines and therapeutics against coronaviruses. The role of mucosal immunity in COVID-19 is significant, influencing both local and systemic immune responses to the virus. Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Mucosally delivered vaccines and those under clinical trials are being compared and contrasted to understand their effectiveness in inducing mucosal immunity against coronaviruses. A greater understanding of lung tissue-based immunity may lead to improved diagnostic and prognostic procedures and novel treatment strategies aimed at reducing the disease burden of community-acquired pneumonia, avoiding the systemic manifestations of infection and excess morbidity and mortality. This comprehensive review article outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. It also proposes that there is a significant role for mucosal immunity and for secretory as well as circulating IgA antibodies in COVID-19, and that it is important to elucidate this in order to comprehend especially the asymptomatic and mild states of the infection, which appear to account for the majority of cases. Moreover, it is possible that mucosal immunity can be exploited for beneficial diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes. The findings from recent studies on mucosal immunity in COVID-19 can be used to develop effective vaccines and treatments that can effectively target both mucosal and systemic immune responses.">

        <tr id="A natural infection or a vaccination can initially prime the immune system to form immunological memory. The immunity engendered by vaccination against COVID-19 versus natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 has not been well studied in the Indian population. In this study, we compared the immunity conferred by COVID-19 vaccines to naturally acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in a South Indian population. We examined binding and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels against the ancestral and variant lineages and assessed the ex vivo cellular parameters of memory T cells, memory B cells, and monocytes and finally measured the circulating cytokine response. COVID-19 vaccination stimulates heightened levels of IgG antibodies against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, as well as increased binding to the spike protein and neutralizing antibody levels. This enhanced response extends to variant lineages such as B.1.617.2 (Delta, India), B.1.1.529 (Omicron, India), B.1.351 (Beta, South Africa), and B.1.1.7 (Alpha, UK). COVID-19 vaccination differs from SARS-CoV-2 infection by having increased frequencies of classical memory B cells, activated memory B and plasma cells, CD4/CD8 T cells of effector memory, effector cells, stem cell-like memory T cells, and classical and intermediate monocytes and diminished frequencies of CD4/CD8 T cells of central memory and non-classical monocytes in vaccinated individuals in comparison to those with natural infection. Thus, COVID-19 vaccination is characterized by enhanced humoral responses and robust activation of innate and memory T cell responses in comparison to natural infection in a South Indian population.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

        <tr id="Fibrosis in the lung is thought to be driven by epithelial cell dysfunction and aberrant cell-cell interactions. Unveiling the molecular mechanisms of cellular plasticity and cell-cell interactions is imperative to elucidating lung regenerative capacity and aberrant repair in pulmonary fibrosis. By mining publicly available RNA-Seq data sets, we identified loss of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) as a candidate contributor to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We used conditional KO mice, scRNA-Seq, lung organoids, small-molecule inhibition, and potentially novel gene manipulation methods to investigate the role of CEBPA in lung fibrosis and repair. Long-term (6 months or more) of Cebpa loss in AT2 cells caused spontaneous fibrosis and increased susceptibility to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Cebpa knockout (KO) in these mice significantly decreased AT2 cell numbers in the lung and reduced expression of surfactant homeostasis genes, while increasing inflammatory cell recruitment as well as upregulating S100a8/a9 in AT2 cells. In vivo treatment with an S100A8/A9 inhibitor alleviated experimental lung fibrosis. Restoring CEBPA expression in lung organoids ex vivo and during experimental lung fibrosis in vivo rescued CEBPA deficiency–mediated phenotypes. Our study establishes a direct mechanistic link between CEBPA repression, impaired AT2 cell identity, disrupted tissue homeostasis, and lung fibrosis.">

This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in extensive health challenges globally. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, clinical studies have revealed that it could also affect multiple organs, including the heart, kidneys, liver, and brain, leading to severe complications. To unravel the intricate molecular interactions between the virus and host tissues, we performed an integrated transcriptomic analysis to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on various organs, with a particular focus on the relationship between renal failure and COVID-19. A comparative analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 triggers a systemic immune response in the brain, heart, and kidney tissues, characterized by significant upregulation of cytokine and chemokine secretion, along with enhanced migration of lymphocytes and leukocytes. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 could also induce tissue-specific transcriptional profiling. More importantly, single-cell sequencing revealed that COVID-19 patients with renal failure exhibited lower metabolic activity in lung epithelial and B cells, with reduced ligand–receptor interactions, especially CD226 and ICAM, suggesting a compromised immune response. A trajectory analysis revealed that COVID-19 patients with renal failure exhibited less mature alveolar type 1 cells. Furthermore, these patients showed potential fibrosis in the hearts, liver, and lung increased extracellular matrix remodeling activities. However, there was no significant metabolic dysregulation in the liver of COVID-19 patients with renal failure. Candidate drugs prediction by Drug Signatures database and LINCS L1000 Antibody Perturbations Database underscored the importance of considering multi-organ effects in COVID-19 management and highlight potential therapeutic strategies, including targeting viral entry and replication, controlling tissue fibrosis, and alleviating inflammation.">

        <tr id="Introduction SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still poses a significant burden on global health and economy, especially for symptoms persisting beyond the acute disease. COVID-19 manifests with various degrees of severity and the identification of early biomarkers capable of stratifying patient based on risk of progression could allow tailored treatments. Methods We longitudinally analyzed 67 patients, classified according to a WHO ordinal scale as having Mild, Moderate, or Severe COVID-19. Peripheral blood samples were prospectively collected at hospital admission and during a 6-month follow-up after discharge. Several subsets and markers of the innate and adaptive immunity were monitored as putative factors associated with COVID-19 symptoms. Results More than 50 immunological parameters were associated with disease severity. A decision tree including the main clinical, laboratory, and biological variables at admission identified low NK-cell precursors and CD14+CD91+ monocytes, and high CD8+ Effector Memory T cell frequencies as the most robust immunological correlates of COVID-19 severity and reduced survival. Moreover, low regulatory B-cell frequency at one month was associated with the susceptibility to develop long COVID at six months, likely due to their immunomodulatory ability. Discussion These results highlight the profound perturbation of the immune response during COVID-19. The evaluation of specific innate and adaptive immune-cell subsets allows to distinguish between different acute and persistent COVID-19 symptoms.">

        <tr id="Neurological involvement has been widely reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, viral identification in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is rarely found. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of virological and immunological biomarkers in CSF for the diagnosis of neuroCOVID-19. We analyzed 69 CSF samples from patients with neurological manifestations: 14 with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, with 5 additional serial CSF samples (group A), and as a control, 50 non-COVID-19 cases (group B—26 with other neuroinflammatory diseases; group C—24 with non-inflammatory diseases). Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) was used to determine SARS-CoV-2, and specific IgG, IgM, neopterin, and protein 10 induced by gamma interferon (CXCL-10) were evaluated in the CSF samples. No samples were amplified for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM were 50% and 14.28%, respectively, with 100% specificity for both tests. CXCL-10 showed high sensitivity (95.83%) and specificity (95.83%) for detection of neuroinflammation. Serial CSF analysis showed an association between the neuroinflammatory biomarkers and outcome (death and hospital discharge) in two cases (meningoencephalitis and rhombencephalitis). The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and specific immunoglobulins in the CSF can be used for neuroCOVID-19 confirmation. Additionally, CXCL-10 in the CSF may contribute to the diagnosis and monitoring of neuroCOVID-19.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

        <tr id="Immunocompromised people are at high risk of prolonged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the efficacy of late-onset direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy with therapeutics in clinical use and experimental drugs to mitigate persistent viral replication is unclear. In this study, we employed an immunocompromised mouse model, which supports prolonged replication of SARS-CoV-2 to explore late-onset treatment options. Tandem immuno-depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice followed by infection with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) beta B.1.351 resulted in prolonged infection with virus replication for 5 weeks after inoculation. Early-onset treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (paxlovid) or molnupiravir was only moderately efficacious, whereas the experimental therapeutic 4'-fluorouridine (4'-FlU, EIDD-2749) significantly reduced virus load in the upper and lower respiratory compartments 4 days postinfection (dpi). All antivirals significantly lowered virus burden in a 7-day treatment regimen initiated 14 dpi, but paxlovid-treated animals experienced rebound virus replication in the upper respiratory tract 7 days after treatment end. Viral RNA was detectable 28 dpi in paxlovid-treated animals, albeit not in the molnupiravir or 4'-FlU groups, when treatment was initiated 14 dpi and continued for 14 days. Low-level virus replication continued 35 dpi in animals receiving vehicle but had ceased in all treatment groups. These data indicate that late-onset DAA therapy significantly shortens the duration of persistent virus replication in an immunocompromised host, which may have implications for clinical use of antiviral therapeutics to alleviate the risk of progression to severe disease in highly vulnerable patients.


IMPORTANCE
Four years after the onset of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the immunocompromised are at greatest risk of developing life-threatening severe disease. However, specific treatment plans for this most vulnerable patient group have not yet been developed. Employing a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-depleted immunocompromised mouse model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we explored therapeutic options of persistent infections with standard-of-care paxlovid, molnupiravir, and the experimental therapeutic 4'-fluorouridine (4'-FlU). Late-onset treatment initiated 14 days after infection was efficacious, but only 4'-FlU was rapidly sterilizing. No treatment-experienced viral variants with reduced susceptibility to the drugs emerged, albeit virus replication rebounded in animals of the paxlovid group after treatment end. This study supports the use of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for late-onset management of persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised hosts. However, treatment courses likely require to be extended for maximal therapeutic benefit, calling for appropriately powered clinical trials to meet the specific needs of this patient group.">

        <tr id="The ability of an organism to overcome infectious diseases has traditionally been linked to killing invading pathogens. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that, apart from restricting pathogen loads, organismal survival is coupled to an additional yet poorly understood mechanism called disease tolerance.

We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that activation of TLR7 or a low physiological activity of STING is sufficient to induce p16High immune subset that, in turn, establishes a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance. Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan.

        <tr id="In 2024, over 775 million cases of COVID-19 were recorded, including approximately 7 million deaths, indicating its widespread and dangerous nature. The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can manifest a wide spectrum of symptoms, from mild infection to respiratory failure and even death. Neurological symptoms, such as headaches, confusion, and impaired consciousness, have also been reported in some COVID-19 patients. These observations suggest the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the central nervous system and induce neuroinflammation during infection. This review specifically explores the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and selected neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic stroke (IS), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It has been observed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus increases the production of cytokines whose action can cause the destruction of the myelin sheaths of nerve cells. Subsequently, the body may synthesize autoantibodies that attack nerve cells, resulting in damage to the brain’s anatomical elements, potentially contributing to the onset of multiple sclerosis. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 exacerbates inflammation, worsening the clinical condition in individuals already suffering from MS. Moreover, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines may lead to an escalation in blood clot formation, which can result in thrombosis, obstructing blood flow to the brain and precipitating an ischemic stroke. AD is characterized by intense inflammation and heightened oxidative stress, both of which are exacerbated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been observed that the SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates enhanced cell entry in the presence of both the ACE2 receptor, which is already elevated in AD and the ApoE ε4 allele. Consequently, the condition worsens and progresses more rapidly, increasing the mortality rate among AD patients. The above information underscores the numerous connections between SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological diseases.">

        <tr id="Rhinovirus C (RV-C) infects airway epithelial cells and is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in humans. To interrogate the mechanisms of RV-C-mediated disease, animal models are essential. Towards this, RV-C infection was recently reported in wild-type (WT) mice, yet, titers were not sustained. Therefore, the requirements for RV-C infection in mice remain unclear. Notably, prior work has implicated human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as essential host factors for virus uptake and replication, respectively. Here, we report that even though human (h) and murine (m) CDHR3 orthologs have similar tissue distribution, amino acid sequence homology is limited. Further, while RV-C can replicate in mouse lung epithelial type 1 (LET1) cells and produce infectious virus, we observed a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of dsRNA-positive cells following hSTING expression. Based on these findings, we sought to assess the impact of hCDHR3 and hSTING on RV-C infection in mice in vivo. Thus, we developed hCDHR3 transgenic mice, and utilized adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver hSTING to the murine airways. Subsequent challenge of these mice with RV-C15 revealed significantly higher titers 24 h post-infection in mice expressing both hCDHR3 and hSTING—compared to either WT mice, or mice with hCDHR3 or hSTING alone, indicating more efficient infection. Ultimately, this mouse model can be further engineered to establish a robust in vivo model, recapitulating viral dynamics and disease.">

        <tr id="In less than a year, SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) has managed to displace Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as the leading cause of death worldwide due to a single infectious agent. Both pathogens affect the respiratory tract, mainly the lungs. However, the impact that a possible Mtb + SARS2 co-infection can have on the host response is still unknown. Herein we propose (depict) a rigorous system to evaluate the complex interaction between the two infections in vitro in a lung epithelial cell line (A549). Overall, the process includes eight steps: (I) Mtb culture, (II) cell maintenance, (III) preparation of viral stocks, (IV) determination of infectious titers, (V) Mtb and SARS2 co-infection, (VI) determination of intracellular bacterial load, (VII) SARS2 viability test, and (VIII) decontamination of supernatants. This comprehensive protocol will allow experimentalists to study the pathogenesis of co-infection in vitro, and facilitate collaborative work in the literature.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Increasing evidence suggests that Fc‐mediated antibody effector functions have an important role in protection against respiratory viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. However, limited data are available on the potential differences in the development, heterogeneity and durability of these responses in children compared to adults. Methods Here, we assessed the development of spike S1‐specific serum antibody‐dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement deposition (ADCD) and natural killer cell activation (ADNKA), alongside specific antibody binding concentrations (IgG, IgA and IgM) and IgG avidity in healthy adults (n = 38, 18–56 years) and children (n = 21, 5–16 years) following primary SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, with a 10‐month longitudinal follow‐up. Differences between groups were assessed using a nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons test. Results We found similar (functional) antibody responses in children compared to adults, with a tendency for increased durability in children, which was statistically significant for ADCD (P < 0.05). While ADNKA was strongly reduced in both adults (P < 0.001) and children (P < 0.05) at the latest time point, ADCP remained relatively stable over time, possibly relating to an increase in avidity of the spike‐specific antibodies (P < 0.001). Finally, the ADNKA capacity relative to antibody concentration appeared to decrease over time in both children and adults. Conclusion In conclusion, our data provide novel insights into the development of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibody Fc‐mediated effector functions in children and adults. An increased understanding of these characteristics in specific age populations is valuable for the future design of novel and improved vaccination strategies for respiratory viruses such as SARS‐CoV‐2.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Throughout history, the influenza A virus has caused numerous devastating global pandemics. Macrophages, as pivotal innate immune cells, exhibit a wide range of immune functions characterized by distinct polarization states, reflecting their intricate heterogeneity. In this study, we employed the time-resolved single-cell sequencing technique coupled with metabolic RNA labelling to elucidate the dynamic transcriptional changes in distinct polarized states of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon infection with the influenza A virus. Our approach not only captures the temporal dimension of transcriptional activity, which is lacking in conventional scRNA-seq methods, but also reveals that M2-polarized Arg1_macrophage cluster is the sole state supporting successful replication of influenza A virus. Furthermore, we identified distinct antigen presentation capabilities to CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells across diverse polarized states of macrophages. Notably, the M1 phenotype, exhibited by (BMDMs) and murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), demonstrated superior conventional and cross-presentation abilities for exogenous antigens, with a particular emphasis on cross-presentation capacity. Additionally, as CD8+ T cell differentiation progressed, M1 polarization exhibited an enhanced capacity for cross-presentation. All three phenotypes of BMDMs, including M1, demonstrated robust presentation to CD4+ regulatory T cells, while displaying limited ability to present to naive CD4+ T cells. These findings offer novel insights into the immunological regulatory mechanisms governing distinct polarized states of macrophages, particularly their roles in restricting the replication of influenza A virus and modulating antigen-specific T cell responses through innate immunity.">

        <tr id="Neural stem cells have intact innate immune responses that protect them from virus infection and cell death. Yet, viruses can antagonize such responses to establish neuropathogenesis. Using a forebrain organoid model system at two developmental time points, we identified that neural stem cells, in particular radial glia, are basally primed to respond to virus infection by upregulating several antiviral interferon-stimulated genes. Infection of these organoids with a neuropathogenic Enterovirus-D68 strain, demonstrated the ability of this virus to impede immune activation by blocking interferon responses. Together, our data highlight immune gene signatures present in different types of neural stem cells and differential viral capacity to block neural-specific immune induction.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a significant worldwide impact, affecting millions of people. COVID-19 is characterized by a heterogenous clinical phenotype, potentially involving hyperinflammation and prolonged tissue damage, although the exact underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. Sphingolipid metabolites, which govern cell survival and proliferation, have emerged as key players in inflammatory signaling and cytokine responses. Given the complex metabolic pathway of sphingolipids, this study aimed to understand their potential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We conducted a comprehensive examination of sphingolipid modulations across groups classified based on disease severity, incorporating a time-course in serum and urine samples. Several sphingolipids, including sphingosine, lactosylceramide, and hexosylceramide, emerged as promising indicators of COVID-19 severity, as validated by correlation analyses conducted on both serum and urine samples. Other sphingolipids, such as sphingosine 1-phosphate, ceramides, and deoxy-dihydroceramides, decreased in both COVID-19 patients and individuals with non-COVID infectious diseases. This suggests that these sphingolipids are not specifically associated with COVID-19 but rather with pathological conditions caused by infectious diseases. Our analysis of urine samples revealed elevated levels of various sphingolipids, with changes dependent on disease severity, potentially highlighting the acute kidney injury associated with COVID-19. This study illuminates the intricate relationship between disturbed sphingolipid metabolism, COVID-19 severity, and clinical factors. These findings provide valuable insights into the broader landscape of inflammatory diseases.">

Using human pericytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia alone; and combined in an in vitro BBB we investigated Mtb +/− HIV-1 co-infection on central nervous system cell entry and function. Mtb infected and multiplied in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. The permeability of the BBB increased resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects included increased markers of cellular stress, ROS release, the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes, and increased secretion of neuroexcitotoxic glutamate. Distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators were observed. These data indicate Mtb can translocate the BBB directly to initiate meningitis.">

        <tr id="The infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with neurotropic viruses induces neuroinflammation and an immune response, which is associated with the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, involving microglia, macrophages, and T and B cells, while required for efficient viral control within the CNS, is also associated with neuropathology. Under pathological events, such as CNS viral infection, microglia/macrophage undergo a reactive response, leading to the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery into the brain, disrupting CNS homeostasis and contributing to the pathogenesis of disease. The Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelination disease (TMEV-IDD), which serves as a mouse model of MS. This murine model made significant contributions to our understanding of the pathophysiology of MS following subsequent to infection. Microglia/macrophages could be activated into two different states, classic activated state (M1 state) and alternative activated state (M2 state) during TMEV infection. M1 possesses the capacity to initiate inflammatory response and secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M2-liked microglia/macrophages are anti-inflammatory characterized by the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This review aims to discuss the roles of microglia/macrophages M1/M2-liked polarization during TMEV infection, and explore the potential therapeutic effect of balancing M1/M2-liked polarization of microglia/macrophages on MS.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background In some patients, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea occur as part of long COVID-19 syndrome following acute respiratory symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, the characteristics of immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract of COVID-19 patients and their association with these symptoms remain unclear. Methodology Data were collected from 95 COVID-19 patients. Among this cohort, 11 patients who exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms and underwent gastroscopy were selected. Using imaging mass cytometry, the gastrointestinal tissues of these patients were thoroughly analyzed to identify immune cell subgroups and investigate their spatial distribution. Results Significant acute inflammatory responses were found in the gastrointestinal tissues, particularly in the duodenum, of COVID-19 patients. These alterations included an increase in the levels of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+CD4+ T-cells, which was more pronounced in tissues with nucleocapsid protein (NP). The amount of CD68+ macrophages positively correlates with the number of CD3+CD4+ T-cells (R = 0.783, p < 0.001), additionally, spatial neighborhood analysis uncovered decreased interactions between CD68+ macrophages and multiple immune cells were noted in NP-positive tissues. Furthermore, weighted gene coexpression network analysis was employed to extract gene signatures related to clinical features and immune responses from the RNA-seq data derived from gastrointestinal tissues from COVID-19 patients, and we validated that the MEgreen module shown positive correlation with clinical parameter (i.e., Total bilirubin, ALT, AST) and macrophages (R = 0.84, p = 0.001), but negatively correlated with CD4+ T cells (R = −0.62, p = 0.004). By contrast, the MEblue module was inversely associated with macrophages and positively related with CD4+ T cells. Gene function enrichment analyses revealed that the MEgreen module is closely associated with biological processes such as immune response activation, signal transduction, and chemotaxis regulation, indicating its role in the gastrointestinal inflammatory response. Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the role of specific immune cell groups in the gastrointestinal inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. Gene coexpression network analysis further emphasized the importance of the gene modules in gastrointestinal immune responses, providing potential molecular targets for the treatment of COVID-19-related gastrointestinal symptoms.">

        <tr id="Introduction Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have been shown to improve disease outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. They may also impair the immune response to vaccines, including the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, available data on both the intrinsic immune effects of DMTs and their influence on cellular response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are still incomplete. Methods Here, we evaluated the immune cell effects of 3 DMTs on the response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination by comparing MS patients treated with one specific therapy (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, or natalizumab) with both healthy controls and untreated patients. We profiled 23 B-cell traits, 57 T-cell traits, and 10 cytokines, both at basal level and after stimulation with a pool of SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides, in 79 MS patients, treated with DMTs or untreated, and 32 healthy controls. Measurements were made before vaccination and at three time points after immunization. Results and Discussion MS patients treated with fingolimod showed the strongest immune cell dysregulation characterized by a reduction in all measured lymphocyte cell classes; the patients also had increased immune cell activation at baseline, accompanied by reduced specific immune cell response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Also, anti-spike specific B cells progressively increased over the three time points after vaccination, even when antibodies measured from the same samples instead showed a decline. Our findings demonstrate that repeated booster vaccinations in MS patients are crucial to overcoming the immune cell impairment caused by DMTs and achieving an immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comparable to that of healthy controls.">

The purpose of this article is to provide a complete summary of the current state and future possibilities for COVID-19 therapies. We describe the many treatment classes, such as antivirals, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies, that have been repurposed or developed to treat COVID-19. We also looked at the clinical evidence for these treatments, including findings from observational studies and randomized-controlled clinical trials, and highlighted the problems and limitations of the available evidence. Furthermore, we reviewed existing clinical trials and prospective COVID-19 therapeutic options, such as novel medication candidates and combination therapies. Finally, we discussed the long-term consequences of COVID-19 and the importance of ongoing research into the development of viable treatments. This review will help physicians, researchers, and policymakers to understand the prevention and mitigation of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Neutralization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by human sera is a strong correlate of protection against symptomatic and severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emergence of antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and the relatively rapid waning of serum antibody titers, however, raises questions about the sustainability of serum protection. In addition to serum neutralization, other antibody functionalities and the memory B cell (MBC) response are suggested to help maintaining this protection. In this study, we investigate the breadth of spike (S) protein-specific serum antibodies that mediate effector functions by interacting with Fc-gamma receptor IIa (FcγRIIa) and FcγRIIIa, and of the receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific MBCs, following a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection with the D614G, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 variant. Irrespectively of the variant causing the infection, the breadth of S protein-specific serum antibodies that interact with FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa and the RBD-specific MBC responses exceeded the breadth of serum neutralization, although the Alpha-induced B cell response seemed more strain-specific. Between VOC groups, both quantitative and qualitative differences in the immune responses were observed, suggesting differences in immunogenicity. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of protective humoral and B cell responses in the light of emerging antigenically distinct VOCs, and highlights the need to study the immune system beyond serum neutralization to gain a better understanding of the protection against emerging variants.">

        <tr id="Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which coexists as four genetically and immunologically distinct serotypes (DENV1-4). In secondary heterologous DENV infection, pre-existing immunity is believed to contribute to severe disease through antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). Although the elevated pathology observed in ADE conditions has been described, the cell intrinsic mechanisms governing this process remain unclear. Using scRNAseq, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages infected by DENV via ADE compared to conventional infection conditions. Unsupervised analysis of scRNAseq data enabled the identification and differentiation of infected and bystander/uninfected cells in a heterogeneous cell culture. Differential gene expression and Ingenuity Pathway analyses revealed a number of significantly up- and down-regulated genes and gene networks between cells infected by ADE compared to conventional infection. Specifically, these pathways indicated mechanisms such as suppressed interferon signaling and inflammatory chemokine transcription in cells infected via ADE. Further analysis revealed that transcriptomic changes were independent of viral RNA within infected cells, suggesting that the observed changes are reflective of cell-intrinsic responses and not simply a function of per-cell viral burden. Bystander cells in ADE conditions also demonstrated distinct profiles, indicating an immunologically activated phenotype enriched for the expression of gene networks involved with protein translation, cytokine production, and antigen presentation. Together, these findings support the concept that DENV infection via ADE induces a qualitatively different transcriptomic response in infected and bystander cells, contributing to our understanding of ADE as a mechanistic driver of disease and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen with a significant and growing global health burden. Although correlates of severe dengue disease are poorly understood, pre-existing immunity to DENV has been associated with severe disease risk and known to contribute to an alternative route of viral entry termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Using single cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct transcriptomic processes involved in antibody-mediated DENV entry compared to conventional receptor mediated entry. These data provide meaningful insight into the discrete processes contributing to DENV pathogenesis in ADE conditions.">

        <tr id="        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2). It is characterized by respiratory distress, multiorgan dysfunction and death in some cases. The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestation. However the pathological mechanism underling the disease has not been fully defined. Lung autopsy samples from 3 patients with fatal COVID-19 were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin stain to analyze the histopathological changes. While immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed for detecting CD4 in helper T-cells, CD8 in cytotoxic T-cells, CD56 in NK-cells and CD45RO in memory T-cells. Histopathological examination revealed features of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with exudate in alveolar space and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Immunohistochemistry staining for CD4 showed weak to positive staining, CD8 showed weak positive staining, CD56 showed negative staining, while CD45RO showed a positive staining. It can be concluded that SARS-CoV-2 virus impaired innate immune response through a decrease in NK cells and adaptive immune response through a decrease in CD8 T cells which is one of the explanations of the destructive nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus.">

        <tr id="The enduring impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its disease manifestation, COVID-19, on public health remains significant. Postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) affect a considerable number of patients, impairing their quality of life. While the role of the cytokine storm in acute COVID-19 is well established, its contribution to the pathophysiology of PASC is not fully understood. This study aimed to analyze the cytokine profile of patients with PASC following in vitro stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, comparing them with a healthy control group. From October 2020 till March 2021, Brugmann University Hospital's clinical research unit included patients with PASC in the study. Whole blood samples were collected from 50 patients and 25 healthy volunteers. After in vitro stimulation under five different conditions, cytokine levels were measured using a multiplex method. Significantly decreased cytokine levels were observed in patients with PASC compared with healthy volunteers, particularly after TLR4 (interleukin [IL]-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-10, interferon (IFN)α, IFNγ, IFNω, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α) and TLR7/8 (IL-1α, IL-1β, IFNα, IFNω, IFNγ, and TNFα) pathway stimulation. Principal component analysis identified two distinct clusters, suggesting a likely dysregulation of immunity involving TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways in patients with PASC. Our study suggests that TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways play a role in the pathophysiology of PASC. Continuous basal activation of immunity could explain the high basal concentrations of cytokines described in these patients and the decreased amplitude of response of these signaling pathways following specific stimulation.">

        <tr id="The average cost to bring a new drug from its initial discovery to a patient's bedside is estimated to surpass $2 billion and requires over a decade of research and development. There is a need for new drug screening technologies that can parse drug candidates with increased likelihood of clinical utility early in development in order to increase the cost-effectiveness of this pipeline. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, resources were rapidly mobilized to identify effective therapeutic treatments but many lead antiviral compounds failed to demonstrate efficacy when progressed to human trials. To address the lack of predictive preclinical drug screening tools, PREDICT96-ALI, a high-throughput (n = 96) microphysiological system (MPS)  that recapitulates primary human tracheobronchial tissue,is adapted for the evaluation of differential antiviral efficacy of native SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Here, PREDICT96-ALI resolves both the differential viral kinetics between variants and the efficacy of antiviral compounds over a range of drug doses. PREDICT96-ALI is able to distinguish clinically efficacious antiviral therapies like remdesivir and nirmatrelvir from promising lead compounds that do not show clinical efficacy. Importantly, results from this proof-of-concept study track with known clinical outcomes, demonstrate the feasibility of this technology as a prognostic drug discovery tool.">

        <tr id="Immunity against respiratory pathogens is often short-term, and, consequently, there is an unmet need for the effective prevention of such infections. One such infectious disease is coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel Beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that emerged around the end of 2019. The World Health Organization declared the illness a pandemic on 11 March 2020, and since then it has killed or sickened millions of people globally. The development of COVID-19 systemic vaccines, which impressively led to a significant reduction in disease severity, hospitalization, and mortality, contained the pandemic’s expansion. However, these vaccines have not been able to stop the virus from spreading because of the restricted development of mucosal immunity. As a result, breakthrough infections have frequently occurred, and new strains of the virus have been emerging. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 will likely continue to circulate and, like the influenza virus, co-exist with humans. The upper respiratory tract and nasal cavity are the primary sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection and, thus, a mucosal/nasal vaccination to induce a mucosal response and stop the virus’ transmission is warranted. In this review, we present the status of the systemic vaccines, both the approved mucosal vaccines and those under evaluation in clinical trials. Furthermore, we present our approach of a B-cell peptide-based vaccination applied by a prime-boost schedule to elicit both systemic and mucosal immunity.">

        <tr id="Through widespread immunization against SARS-CoV-2 prior to or post-infection, a substantial segment of the global population has acquired both humoral and cellular immunity, and there has been a notable reduction in the incidence of severe and fatal cases linked to this virus and accelerated recovery times for those infected. Nonetheless, a significant demographic, comprising around 20% to 30% of the adult population, remains unimmunized due to diverse factors. Furthermore, alongside those recovered from the infection, there is a subset of the population experiencing persistent symptoms referred to as Long COVID. This condition is more prevalent among individuals with underlying health conditions and immune system impairments. Some Long COVID pathologies stem from direct damage inflicted by the viral infection, whereas others arise from inadequate immune system control over the infection or suboptimal immunoregulation. There are differences in the serum cytokines and miRNA profiles between infected individuals who develop severe COVID-19 or Long COVID and those who control adequately the infection. This review delves into the advantages and constraints associated with employing imiquimod in human subjects to enhance the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 immunization. Restoration of the immune system can modify it towards a profile of non-susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. An adequate immune system has the potential to curb viral propagation, mitigate symptoms, and ameliorate the severe consequences of the infection.">

        <tr id="Background/Rationale We investigated the effect of pre-existing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human coronaviruses on infection outcomes in Omicron BA1/2 exposed household members from January to March 2022. Methods Data from a prospective household study in the Netherlands were used including 63 households with 195 household members exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA1/2 index case. The protocol included repeated nose-throat swab and saliva RT-PCR testing, paired serology, and self-reported daily symptom scoring by household members. Infection outcomes included the occurrence of secondary infections, symptom severity, and CT-value trajectories. We studied the effect of baseline binding antibody levels for SARS-CoVs and seasonal coronaviruses (hCoV) NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43 spike protein, on SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Results 132 of 195 (68%) exposed household members developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among exposed household members, higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 and beta hCoV antibodies (HKU1 and OC43) at baseline, were associated with a reduced risk of secondary infection (adjusted Odds ratio 0.61; 95% Confidence interval 0.44-0.84 and aOR 0.72; 95%CI 0.56-0.92, respectively). No significant differences between antibody levels and symptom burden or CT-value trajectories were observed. Conclusions Our study suggests that prior SARS-CoV-2 and beta hCoV antibodies provide some protection against Omicron BA.1/BA.2 infection, while effects on symptom burden or CT-value could not be demonstrated. The results highlight the relatively limited, but not negligible role of cross-protective antibodies, especially when facing immune escape variants of SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Objective: The immune response initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is poorly elucidated. We aimed to access and compare the antiviral cellular responses and lymphocytes activation between healthy pregnancies and pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We detected the immunological changes of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of healthy non-pregnant women, non-pregnant women with COVID-19, healthy pregnant women, pregnant women with COVID-19 and convalescent group by flow cytometry. In vitro blockade was used to identify NKT-like cell activation through ICOS-ICOSL pathway. Results: We found that CD3+CD56+ NKT-like cells decreased significantly in COVID-19 positive pregnant women compared to healthy pregnant women. NKT-like cells of pregnant women expressed higher level of activating receptors CD69 and NKp46 after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly, they also increased the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule ICOS. NKT-like cells of pregnant women with COVID-19 up-regulated the expression of IFN-γ, CD107a and Ki67. Meanwhile, we found that ICOSL expression was significantly increased on pDCs in pregnant women with COVID-19. Blocking ICOS in vitro significantly decreased the antiviral activity of NKT-like cells in COVID-19 positive pregnant women, suggesting that ICOS-ICOSL may play an important role in the virus clearance by NKT-like cells. Conclusions: During SARS-CoV-2 infection, NKT-like cells of pregnant women activated through ICOS-ICOSL pathway and played an important role in the antiviral response.">

        <tr id="Background: A pandemic classification for COVID-19 was later issued. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was the cause of it. It spreads quickly and can result in severe respiratory failure at an early stage. Clinical research has demonstrated that the risk of infection is increased by both aging and chronic conditions. As such, blood group effects on the COVID-19 infection and its progression remain unknown. Aim: This study investigates possible relationships between patient blood group types, risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 in diabetic patients. Methodology: Age (41–60) was shown to be the age group most susceptible to infection with the SARS–COVID–19 virus, according to a statistical analysis of data from 90 individuals infected with COVID-19. Based on gender, the findings indicated that women had a greater incidence of diabetes than men did, with women having a 46% incidence of diabetes and men having a 44% infection rate. The blood types A and O were the most prevalent. According to the results of the current investigation, blood type O+ individuals had a higher prevalence of diabetes than blood type O-individuals. Based on gender, the findings indicated that women had a greater incidence of diabetes than men did, with women having a 46% incidence of diabetes and men having a 44% infection rate. Results: The results of the present study suggest that while blood group A might have a role in increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, blood group O might be somewhat protective. However, blood group type does not seem to influence clinical outcomes once infected.">

        <tr id="Long COVID (post-acute sequelae of COVID-19—PASC) is a consequence of infection by SARS-CoV-2 that continues to disrupt the well-being of millions of affected individuals for many months beyond their first infection. While the exact mechanisms underlying PASC remain to be defined, hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of long COVID are varied and include (but are not limited to) dysregulated local or systemic inflammatory responses, autoimmune mechanisms, viral-induced hormonal imbalances, skeletal muscle abnormalities, complement dysregulation, novel abzymes, and long-term persistence of virus and/or fragments of viral RNA or proteins. This review article is based on a comprehensive review of the wide range of symptoms most often observed in long COVID and an attempt to integrate that information into a plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of PASC. In particular, it is proposed that long-term dysregulation of the gut in response to viral persistence could lead to the myriad of symptoms observed in PASC.">

        <tr id="Acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is paralleled by a rise in the peripheral levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), suggesting early nervous system damage. In a cohort of 103 COVID-19 patients, we studied the relationship between the NfL and peripheral inflammatory markers. We found that the NfL levels are significantly predicted by a panel of circulating cytokines/chemokines, including CRP, IL-4, IL-8, IL-9, Eotaxin, and MIP-1ß, which are highly up-regulated during COVID-19 and are associated with clinical outcomes. Our findings show that peripheral cytokines influence the plasma levels of the NfL, suggesting a potential role of the NfL as a marker of neuronal damage associated with COVID-19 inflammation.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is characterized by excessive inflammation leading to the development of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) derived from ω6 and ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are central to the regulation of inflammation, controlling both its initiation and resolution. Still, their role in COVID-19 remains underexplored. By employing a holistic approach involving the analysis of white blood cell transcriptomes, targeted lipidomics, cytokine and immune cell profiling, across the spectrum of disease severity groups, including mild non-hospitalized patients and healthy individuals, we now show that LM networks are profoundly altered in COVID-19, correlate with inflammatory patterns, and stratify patients according to disease severity. Central to this are CYP450-derived LMs such as 20-HETE, lipid peroxidation metabolites such as iPF2a-VI, and lipoxygenase-derived LMs such as 12-HETE, all of which are major vasoactive mediators of inflammation. Among them, 20-HETE appears to be a promising prognostic biomarker for ICU admission and a potential therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 disease. Our study thus underscores the significance of LM networks in COVID-19 pathophysiology and sheds light into the broader mechanisms driving viral pneumonia in humans.">

        <tr id="Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus transmitted via aerosols. To understand how MeV exits the airways of an infected host, we use unpassaged primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE). MeV typically remains cell-associated in HAE and forms foci of infection, termed infectious centers, by directly spreading cell-to-cell. We previously described the phenomenon in which infectious centers detach en masse from HAE and remain viable. Here we investigate the mechanism of this cellular detachment. Via immunostaining, we observed loss of tight junction and cell adhesion proteins within infectious centers. These morphological changes indicate activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT can contribute to wound healing in respiratory epithelia by mobilizing nearby cells. Inhibiting TGF-β, and thus EMT, reduced infectious center detachment. Compared to uninfected cells, MeV-infected cells also expressed increased levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a regulator of live cell extrusion. Live cell extrusion encourages cells to detach from respiratory epithelia by contracting the actomyosin of neighboring cells. Inhibition or induction of live cell extrusion impacted infectious center detachment rates. Thus, these two related pathways contributed to infectious center detachment in HAE. Detached infectious centers contained high titers of virus that may be protected from the environment, allowing the virus to live on surfaces longer and infect more hosts. This mechanism may contribute to the highly contagious nature of MeV. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely contagious respiratory pathogen that continues to cause large, disruptive outbreaks each year. Here, we examine a phenomenon that may help explain the contagious nature of MeV: detachment of MeV-infected cells. MeV spreads cell-to-cell in human airway epithelial cells (HAE) to form groups of infected cells, termed “infectious centers”. We reported that infectious centers ultimately detach from HAE as a unit, carrying high titers of virus. Viral particles within cells may be more protected from environmental conditions, such as ultraviolet radiation and desiccation. We identified two host pathways, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and live cell extrusion, that contribute to infectious center detachment. Perturbing these pathways altered the kinetics of infectious centers detachment. These pathways influence one another and contribute to epithelial wound healing, suggesting infectious center detachment may be a usurped consequence of the host’s response to infection that benefits MeV by increasing its transmissibility between hosts.">

We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (CVOID-19) has varied clinical manifestations including mild to severe acute respiratory symptoms. Inflammasome complex and mitochondria play an important role in initiating inflammatory responses and could potentially be affected by this infection. To study the inflammasome and mitochondrial fission and fusion gene expression levels in COVID-19 patients, we designed this experiment. 
The inflammasome and mitochondrial gene expression profiles were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the peripheral blood of 70 hospitalized CVOID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms (HOSP) and 30 ICU patients with severe symptoms (ICU) compared to 20 healthy controls (HC). 
The results indicated that the expression of the dynamin-related protein-1 was extremely suppressed in HOSP while it came back to the normal range in the ICU group. However, the expression of fission 1 protein had a non-significant increase in HOSP and a decrease in the ICU group. The mitofusin-1 and dominant optic atrophy genes showed high expression levels (10-fold) and (70-fold), respectively, in the HOSP group. However, mitofusin-2 significantly decreased in both groups. Although leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 (NLRP3) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activating and recruitment domain genes dramatically increased in both groups (10 and 4-fold), other inflammasome genes declined in both groups. Finally, Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activate d B cells (NF-κB) extremely decreased, and Intreleukine-1 showed high expression in ICU patients (3-fold). 
CVOID-19 infection suppresses the fission genes and elevates the fusion gene expression in mitochondria, and it can cause activation of the inflammasome via the NLRP3 pathway.">

        <tr id="Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the severity of COVID-19, since the respiratory, thrombotic and myocardial complications of the disease are closely linked to vascular endothelial damage. To address this issue, we evaluate here the effect of conditioned media from spike S1-activated macrophages (CM_S1) on the proliferation of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), focusing on the specific role of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Results obtained demonstrate that the incubation with CM_S1 for 72 h hinders endothelial cell proliferation and induces signs of cytotoxicity. Comparable results are obtained upon exposure to IFN-γ + TNF-α, which are thus postulated to play a pivotal role in the effects observed. These events are associated with an increase in p21 protein and a decrease in Rb phosphorylation, as well as with the activation of IRF-1 and NF-kB transcription factors. Overall, these findings further sustain the pivotal role of a hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines as a trigger for endothelial activation and injury in the immune-mediated effects of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Epithelial injury calls for a regenerative response from a coordinated network of epithelial stem cells and immune cells. Defining this network is key to preserving the repair process for acute resolution, but also for preventing a remodeling process with chronic dysfunction. We recently identified an immune niche for basal-epithelial stem cells using mouse models of injury after respiratory viral infection. Niche function depended on an early sentinel population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) that provided ligand GPNMB to basal-ESC receptor CD44 for reprogramming towards chronic lung disease. These same cell and molecular control points worked directly in mouse and human basal-ESC organoids, but the findings were not yet validated in vivo in human disease. Further, persistence of GPNMB expression in moDCs and M2-macrophages in mouse models suggested utility as a long-term disease biomarker in humans. Here we show increased expression of GPNMB localized to moDC-macrophage populations in lung tissue samples from long-term Covid, asthma, and COPD. The findings thereby provide initial evidence of a persistent and correctable pathway from acute injury to chronic disease with implications for cellular reprogramming and inflammatory memory.">

        <tr id="Background Severe COVID and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) are characterized by excessive inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. In adults, disease severity is associated with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG Fc afucosylation, which induces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from innate immune cells. This study aimed to define spike IgG Fc glycosylation following SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults and children and following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in adults and the relationships between glycan modifications and cytokine/chemokine levels. Methods We analyzed longitudinal (n=146) and cross-sectional (n=49) serum/plasma samples from adult and pediatric COVID patients, MIS-C patients, adult vaccinees, and adult and pediatric healthy controls. We developed methods for characterizing bulk and spike IgG Fc glycosylation by capillary electrophoresis (CE) and measured levels of ten inflammatory cytokines/chemokines by multiplexed ELISA. Results Spike IgG were more afucosylated than bulk IgG during acute adult COVID and MIS-C. We observed an opposite trend following vaccination, but it was not significant. Spike IgG were more galactosylated and sialylated and less bisected than bulk IgG during adult COVID, with similar trends observed during pediatric COVID/MIS-C and following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Spike IgG glycosylation changed with time following adult COVID or vaccination. Afucosylated spike IgG exhibited inverse and positive correlations with inflammatory markers in MIS-C and following vaccination, respectively; galactosylated and sialylated spike IgG inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines in adult COVID and MIS-C; and bisected spike IgG positively correlated with inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in multiple groups. Conclusions We identified previously undescribed relationships between spike IgG glycan modifications and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines that expand our understanding of IgG glycosylation changes that may impact COVID and MIS-C immunopathology.">

In this paper, we review the most recent studies on the complicated dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune system, highlight the importance of understanding these dynamics in developing effective treatments and formulate potent management strategies for COVID-19. We describe the activation of the host's innate immunity and the subsequent adaptive immune response following infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the review emphasizes the immune evasion strategies of the SARS-CoV-2, including inhibition of interferon production and induction of cytokine storms, along with the resulting clinical outcomes. Finally, we assess the efficacy of current treatment strategies, including antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and anti-inflammatory treatments, and discuss their role in providing immunity and preventing severe disease.">

        <tr id="The increased incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, occurring in patients infected with severe influenza or SARS-CoV-2, suggests that antiviral immune responses create an environment permissive to fungal infection. Our recent evidence suggests that absence of the type I IFN receptor 2 subunit (IFNAR2) of the heterodimeric IFNAR1/2 receptor is allowing for this permissive immune environment of the lung through regulation of damage responses. Because damage is associated with poor outcome to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, this suggested that IFNAR2 may be involved in A. fumigatus susceptibility. In this study, we determined that absence of IFNAR2 resulted in increased inflammation, morbidity, and damage in the lungs in response to A. fumigatus challenge, whereas absence of IFNAR1 did not. Although the Ifnar2-/- mice had increased morbidity, we found that the Ifnar2-/- mice cleared more conidia compared with both wild-type and Ifnar1-/- mice. However, this early clearance did not prevent invasive disease from developing in the Ifnar2-/- mice as infection progressed. Importantly, by altering the inflamed environment of the Ifnar2-/- mice early during A. fumigatus infection, by neutralizing TNF-α, we were able to reduce the morbidity and fungal clearance in these mice back to wild-type levels. Together, our results establish a distinct role for IFNAR2 in regulating host damage responses to A. fumigatus and contributing to an A. fumigatus-permissive environment through regulation of inflammation. Specifically, our data reveal a role for IFNAR2 in regulating TNF-α-mediated damage and morbidity during A. fumigatus infection.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging flavivirus, is associated with devasting developmental and neurological disease outcomes particularly in infants infected in utero. Towards understanding the molecular underpinnings of the unique ZIKV disease pathologies, numerous transcriptome-wide studies have been undertaken. Notably, these studies have overlooked the assimilation of RNA-seq analysis from ZIKV-infected patients with cell culture model systems. In this study we find that ZIKV-infection of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, mirrored both the transcriptional and alternative splicing profiles from previously published RNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from pediatric patients during early acute, late acute, and convalescent phases of ZIKV infection. Our analyses show that ZIKV infection in cultured cells correlates with transcriptional changes in patients, while the overlap in alternative splicing profiles was not as extensive. Overall, our data indicate that cell culture model systems support dissection of select molecular changes detected in patients and establishes the groundwork for future studies elucidating the biological implications of alternative splicing during ZIKV infection.">

        <tr id="Background Granulomas (defining tuberculosis histopathological feature) are central to the host’s defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, critically influencing patient outcomes. However, knowledge of human granulomas’ structure and function are incomplete. This study employs single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to dissect human granuloma’s cellular composition, structure, communication and function from 19 pulmonary, lymphatic and skeletal samples. Results Our study identified nine key immune-activated/signaling-active cell clusters. Notably, we delineated a three-layered granuloma structure: a core with macrophages (Macro-c09, Macro-c10) and occasional fibroblasts (Fib-c03); a fibroblast-rich (Fib-c01) periphery; and an immune-infiltrated intermediate layer comprising diverse immune-cells recruited by strong signaling-molecules (SPP1/MIF) from core/periphery cells. This study also shows granuloma heterogeneity across individuals and tissues. Conclusions By merging scRNA-seq with ST-seq, we offer an intricate single-cell perspective of granulomas’ spatial-structure and formation mechanisms, identify signaling-molecules and significantly changed genes as potential targets for host-directed tuberculosis immunotherapy, highlight fibroblasts’ crucial role in granuloma formation, and provide an important reference/improved understanding of TB.">

        <tr id="Abstract The poor prognosis observed in elderly individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) remains a serious clinical burden and the underlying mechanism is unclear, which necessities detailed investigation of disease characteristics and research for efficient countermeasures. To simulate lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in senescent human patients, 80‐week‐old male hamsters are intranasally inoculated with different doses of SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 variant. Exposure to a low dose of the Omicron BA.5 variant results in early activation of the innate immune response, followed by rapid viral clearance and minimal lung damage. However, a high dose of BA.5 results in impaired interferon signaling, cytokine storm, uncontrolled viral replication, and severe lung injury. To decrease viral load and reverse the deterioration of COVID‐19, a new bio‐mimic decoy called CoVR‐MV is used as a preventive or therapeutic agent. Administration of CoVR‐MV as a preventive or therapeutic intervention in the early stages of infection can effectively suppress viral load, regulate the immune response, and rescue animals from death and critical illness. These findings underscore the risk associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 exposure in senescent hamsters and highlight the importance of early intervention to prevent disease progression.">

        <tr id="Abstract The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has occurred in Massachusetts in multiple waves led by a series of emerging variants. While the evidence has linked obesity with severe symptoms of COVID-19, the effect of obesity on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Identification of intrinsic factors, which increase the likelihood of exposed individuals succumbing to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection could help plan mitigation efforts to curb the illness. We aim to investigate whether obese individuals have a higher susceptibility to developing productive SARS-CoV-2 infection given comparable exposure to nonobese individuals. This case–control study leveraged data from the Mass General Brigham's (MGB) electronic medical records (EMR), containing 687,813 patients, to determine whether obesity at any age increases the proportion of infections. We used PCR results of 72,613 subjects who tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 or declared exposure to the virus independently of the result of the test. For this study, we defined susceptibility as the likelihood of testing positive upon suspected exposure. We demonstrate evidence that SARS-CoV-2 exposed obese individuals were more prone to become COVID positive than nonobese individuals [adjusted odds ratio = 1.34 (95% CI: 1.29–1.39)]. Temporal analysis showed significantly increased susceptibility in obese individuals across the duration of the pandemic in Massachusetts. Obese exposed individuals are at a higher risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. This indicates that obesity is not only a risk factor for worsened outcomes but also increases the risk for infection upon exposure. Identifying such populations early will be crucial for curbing the spread of this infectious disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Aims SARS‐CoV‐2 causes systemic immune dysfunction, leading to severe respiratory dysfunction and multiorgan dysfunction. Granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) therapy is designed to regulate an excessive inflammatory response and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We aimed to investigate a targeted subset of granulocytes and monocytes to be removed after GMA therapy in patients with severe COVID‐19 infection. Methods We established an ex vivo experimental system to study the effects of GMA. Blood samples were collected into EDTA‐treated tubes and a mixture of blood samples and cellulose acetate beads was used in GMA. After GMA, blood samples were removed, and the granulocyte and monocyte subtypes before and after GMA were determined by CyTOF mass cytometry. To analyze mass cytometry data with a self‐organizing map, hierarchical clustering was used to determine the appropriate number of metaclusters from t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results We included seven patients with severe COVID‐19 and four age‐ and sex‐matched volunteers. Granulocyte subsets removed by GMA strongly expressed CD11b, CD16, and CD66b, and weakly expressed CD11c, consistent with mature and activated neutrophils. Monocyte subsets strongly expressed CD14, weakly expressed CD33 and CD45RO, and did not express CD16. These subsets were indicated to promote the release of inflammatory cytokines and activate T cells. Conclusions The identification of the granulocyte and monocyte subsets removed after GMA in patients with severe COVID‐19 may help explain the potential mechanism underlying the effectiveness of GMA in COVID‐19 and other inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Global amphibian declines are compounded by deadly disease outbreaks caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Much has been learned about the roles of amphibian skin-produced antimicrobial components and microbiomes in controlling Bd, yet almost nothing is known about the roles of skin-resident immune cells in anti-Bd defenses. Mammalian mast cells reside within and serve as key immune sentinels in barrier tissues like skin. Accordingly, we investigated the roles of Xenopus laevis frog mast cells during Bd infections. Our findings indicate that enrichment of X. laevis skin mast cells confers anti-Bd protection and ameliorates the inflammation-associated skin damage caused by Bd infection. This includes a significant reduction in infiltration of Bd-infected skin by neutrophils, promoting mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands, and preventing Bd-mediated changes to skin microbiomes. Mammalian mast cells are known for their production of the pleiotropic interleukin-4 (IL4) cytokine and our findings suggest that the X. laevis IL4 plays a key role in manifesting the effects seen following cutaneous mast cell enrichment. Together, this work underscores the importance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in anti-Bd defenses and illuminates a novel avenue for investigating amphibian host–chytrid pathogen interactions.">

        <tr id="Oxygen as a key element has a high impact on cellular processes. Infection with a pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 and after inflammation may lead to hypoxic conditions in tissue that impact cellular responses. To develop optimized translational in vitro models for a better understanding of physiologic and pathophysiologic oxygen conditions, it is a prerequisite to determine oxygen concentrations generated in vivo. Our study objective was the establishment of an invasive method for oxygen measurements using a luminescence-based microsensor to determine the dissolved oxygen in the lung tissue of ferrets as animal models for SARS-CoV-2 research. By way of analogy to humans, aged ferrets are more likely to show clinical signs after SARS-CoV-2 infection than are young animals. To investigate oxygen concentrations during a respiratory viral infection, we intratracheally infected nine aged (3-yr-old) ferrets with SARS-CoV-2. The aged SARS-CoV-2–infected ferrets showed mild to moderate clinical signs associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding until 14 days postinfection. SARS-CoV-2–infected ferrets showed histopathologic lung lesion scores that significantly negatively correlated with oxygen concentrations in lung tissue. At 4 days postinfection, oxygen concentrations in lung tissue were significantly lower (mean percentage O2, 3.89 ≙ ≈ 27.78 mm Hg) than in the negative control group (mean percentage O2, 8.65 ≙ ≈ 61.4 mm Hg).

        <tr id="The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic had an extensive impact on global morbidity and mortality. Several other common respiratory viruses, such as the influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are endemic or epidemic agents causing acute respiratory infections that are easily transmissible and pose a significant threat to communities due to efficient person-to-person transmission. These viruses can undergo antigenic variation through genetic mutations, resulting in the emergence of novel strains or variants, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of current vaccines, and necessitating ongoing monitoring and adjustment of vaccine antigens. As the virus-specific immunity is maintained only for several weeks or months after the infection, there is an emergent need to develop effective and durable vaccines. Additionally, specific populations, such as elderly or immunocompromised individuals, may exhibit reduced immune responses to respiratory viruses, posing significant challenges to develop vaccines that elicit durable and potent immunity. We present a comprehensive review of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and virulence of common respiratory viruses, such as RSV, influenza virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We discuss several vaccine approaches that are under development. A thorough understanding of the current strategies and the challenges encountered during the vaccine development process can lead to the advancement of effective next-generation vaccines.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the critical need to integrate immunomics within the One Health framework to effectively address zoonotic diseases across humans, animals, and environments. Employing advanced high-throughput technologies, this interdisciplinary approach reveals the complex immunological interactions among these systems, enhancing our understanding of immune responses and yielding vital insights into the mechanisms that influence viral spread and host susceptibility. Significant advancements in immunomics have accelerated vaccine development, improved viral mutation tracking, and broadened our comprehension of immune pathways in zoonotic transmissions. This review highlights the role of animals, not merely as carriers or reservoirs, but as essential elements of ecological networks that profoundly influence viral epidemiology. Furthermore, we explore how environmental factors shape immune response patterns across species, influencing viral persistence and spillover risks. Moreover, case studies demonstrating the integration of immunogenomic data within the One Health framework for COVID-19 are discussed, outlining its implications for future research. However, linking humans, animals, and the environment through immunogenomics remains challenging, including the complex management of vast amounts of data and issues of scalability. Despite challenges, integrating immunomics data within the One Health framework significantly enhances our strategies and responses to zoonotic diseases and pandemic threats, marking a crucial direction for future public health breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="In atopic dermatitis (AD), lesional skin is frequently colonized by Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, contributing to the severity and clinical symptoms of the disease. The inflammatory milieu in the skin is characterized by a type 2 inflammatory signature, including M2 macrophages, which cannot eradicate S. aureus. Since S. aureus is effectively controlled in macrophages activated by pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced NF-κB and interferon (IFN)-γ-induced STAT1 stimulation, we hypothesized that pre-treatment with LPS as a PRR/TLR4-activating agent and IFN-γ would induce effective control of S. aureus in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) of AD patients. Our data show that the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD is strongly expressed in skin macrophages and MDMs from AD patients compared to healthy controls and impairs the anti-staphylococcal activity of PRR-activated and IFN-treated MDMs. Functionally, CYLD impaired M1 macrophage polarization, as evidenced by reduced expression of CD80, TNF, and IL-6 upon LPS- and IFN-γ treatment in CYLD-deficient as compared to wild-type (WT) MDM/THP1 macrophages. Mechanistically, CYLD inhibited IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and activation by binding to STAT1 and inducing its K63 deubiquitination. CYLD also interacted with TRAF6 and NEMO/IKKγ in the MYD88 signaling pathway and with RIPK2 in the NOD2 pathway, leading to impaired activation of NF-κB. Inhibition of both STAT1 by siRNA and NF-κB by IKK inhibitor treatment, respectively, independently abolished the control of S. aureus in both CYLD-deficient and WT THP1 macrophages, which harbored identical high numbers of the pathogen. The in vivo inhibitory function of CYLD on the control of S. aureus was also observed upon infection of Cyld-deficient and WT mice. Collectively, these data illustrate that the increased expression of CYLD in macrophages of AD patients is a factor contributing to the ineffective control of S. aureus, diminishes M1 macrophage polarization, and that CYLD deletion unleashes the break on effective STAT1 and NF-κB-dependent control of S. aureus.">

While both two dimensional cell culture and animal models exist for NTM infections, a major knowledge gap is the early responses of human alveolar and innate immune cells to NTM within the human alveolar microenvironment. Here we describe development of a humanized, three-dimensional, alveolus lung-on-a-chip (ALoC) model of Mycobacterium fortuitum lung infection that incorporates only primary human cells such as pulmonary vascular endothelial cells in a vascular channel, and type I and II alveolar cells and monocyte-derived macrophages in an alveolar channel along an air-liquid interface. M. fortuitum introduced into the alveolar channel primarily infected macrophages, with rare bacteria inside alveolar cells. Bulk-RNA sequencing of infected chips revealed marked upregulation of transcripts for cytokines, chemokines and secreted protease inhibitors (SERPINs). Our results demonstrate how a humanized ALoC system can identify critical early immune and epithelial responses to M. fortuitum infection. We envision potential application of the ALoC to other NTM and for studies of new antibiotics.">

In a study of a perforin-deficient mouse model of HLH with a viral trigger, we aimed to determine if CD8+ T cell behaviour could be modulated by targeted interleukin (IL)-2 treatment. We observed a paradoxical benefit that contrasted with IL-2’s typical role in boosting T cell activity: targeted IL-2 delivery to CD8+ T cells led to reduced hyperinflammation and disease severity. Our results demonstrated that IL-2 induced exhaustion in overactive CD8+ T cells, thus mitigating hyperinflammation. These findings highlight the context-dependency of cytokine treatment and suggest new therapeutic strategies for HLH and other inflammatory diseases by leveraging cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The distinct functions of immune cells in atherosclerosis have been mostly defined by preclinical mouse studies. Contrastingly, the immune cell composition of human atherosclerotic plaques and their contribution to disease progression is only poorly understood. It remains uncertain whether genetic animal models allow for valuable translational approaches.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to define the immune cell landscape in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The human immune cell repertoire demonstrated an unexpectedly high heterogeneity and was dominated by cells of the T-cell lineage, a finding confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Bioinformatical integration with 7 mouse scRNA-seq data sets from adventitial and atherosclerotic vascular tissue revealed a total of 51 identities of cell types and differentiation states, of which some were only poorly conserved between species and exclusively found in humans. Locations, frequencies, and transcriptional programs of immune cells in mouse models did not resemble the immune cell landscape in human carotid atherosclerosis. In contrast to standard mouse models of atherosclerosis, human plaque leukocytes were dominated by several T-cell phenotypes with transcriptional hallmarks of T-cell activation and memory formation, T-cell receptor-, and pro-inflammatory signaling. Only mice at the age of 22 months partially resembled the activated T-cell phenotype. In a validation cohort of 43 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, the abundance of activated immune cell subsets in the plaque defined by multi-color flow cytometry associated with the extend of clinical atherosclerosis.


CONCLUSIONS
Integrative scRNA-seq reveals a substantial difference in the immune cell composition of murine and human carotid atherosclerosis - a finding that questions the translational value of standard mouse models for adaptive immune cell studies. Clinical associations suggest a specific role for T-cell driven (auto-) immunity in human plaque formation and -instability.">

        <tr id="Following the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, certain individuals experience persistent symptoms referred to as long COVID. This study analyzed the patients categorized into three distinct groups: (1) individuals presenting rheumatological symptoms associated with long COVID, (2) patients who have successfully recovered from COVID-19, and (3) donors who have never contracted COVID-19. A notable decline in the expression of miR-200c-3p, miR-766-3p, and miR-142-3p was identified among patients exhibiting rheumatological symptoms of long COVID. The highest concentration of miR-142-3p was found in healthy donors. One potential way to reduce miRNA concentrations is through antibody-mediated hydrolysis. Not only can antibodies possessing RNA-hydrolyzing activity recognize the miRNA substrate specifically, but they also catalyze its hydrolysis. The analysis of the catalytic activity of plasma antibodies revealed that antibodies from patients with long COVID demonstrated lower hydrolysis activity against five fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the Flu-miR-146b-5p, Flu-miR-766-3p, Flu-miR-4742-3p, and Flu-miR-142-3p miRNAs and increased activity against the Flu-miR-378a-3p miRNA compared to other patient groups. The changes in miRNA concentrations and antibody-mediated hydrolysis of miRNAs are assumed to have a complex regulatory mechanism that is linked to gene pathways associated with the immune system. We demonstrate that all six miRNAs under analysis are associated with a large number of signaling pathways associated with immune response-associated pathways.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a global respiratory disease, which annually leads to 3-5 million cases of severe illness, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths. Additionally, during the past century, four global IAV pandemics have claimed millions of human lives. The epithelial lining of the trachea plays a vital role during IAV infection, both as point of viral entry and replication as well as in the antiviral immune response. Tracheal tissue is generally inaccessible from human patients, which makes animal models crucial for the study of the tracheal host immune response.In this study, pigs were inoculated with swine- or human-adapted H1N1 IAV to gain insight into how host adaptation of IAV shapes the innate immune response during infection. In-depth multi-omics analysis (global proteomics and RNA sequencing) of the host response in upper and lower tracheal tissue was conducted, and results were validated by microfluidic qPCR. Additionally, a subset of samples was selected for histopathological examination.A classical innate antiviral immune response was induced in both upper and lower trachea after infection with either swine- or human-adapted IAV with upregulation of genes and higher abundance of proteins associated with viral infection and recognition, accompanied by a significant induction of interferon stimulated genes with corresponding higher proteins concentrations. Infection with the swine-adapted virus induced a much stronger immune response compared to infection with a human-adapted IAV strain in the lower trachea, which could be a consequence of a higher viral load and a higher degree of inflammation.Central components of the JAK-STAT pathway, apoptosis, pyrimidine metabolism, and the cytoskeleton were significantly altered depending on infection with swine- or human-adapted virus and might be relevant mechanisms in relation to antiviral immunity against putative zoonotic IAV. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that during host adaptation, IAV evolve to modulate important host cell elements to favor viral infectivity and replication.">

        <tr id="Critical lung damage and death are the most profound outcomes associated with the cytokine storm induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is well known that COVID-19 in many patients triggers hyperactivation of the immune system, resulting in the release of a diverse set of cytokine signal molecules in the pulmonary tissue, leading to a potentially lethal hyperinflammatory condition. One cytokine found to play a central role in this outcome is interleukin-6 (IL-6). Therefore, preventing IL-6 signaling could potentially improve patient outcomes. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor agonist originally approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis, which was found to be effective at reducing the mortality of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms through prevention of the aforementioned induced cytokine storm. Clinical trials have supported this conclusion and will be addressed, such as the RECOVERY and COVACTA trials. Results have shown a decrease in mortality, as well as an increase in discharge rate. Future research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms as well as the therapeutic roles of Tocilizumab on COVID-19 and similar pneumonia by virus infections.">

        <tr id="Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Mayaro (MAYV) viruses are arthritogenic alphaviruses that promote an incapacitating and long-lasting inflammatory muscle–articular disease. Despite studies pointing out the importance of skeletal muscle (SkM) in viral pathogenesis, the long-term consequences on its physiology and the mechanism of persistence of symptoms are still poorly understood. Combining molecular, morphological, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and histological analysis, we conduct a temporal investigation of CHIKV and MAYV replication in a wild-type mice model, focusing on the impact on SkM composition, structure, and repair in the acute and late phases of infection. We found that viral replication and induced inflammation promote a rapid loss of muscle mass and reduction in fiber cross-sectional area by upregulation of muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and Atrogin-1 expression, both key regulators of SkM fibers atrophy. Despite a reduction in inflammation and clearance of infectious viral particles, SkM atrophy persists until 30 days post-infection. The genomic CHIKV and MAYV RNAs were still detected in SkM in the late phase, along with the upregulation of chemokines and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. In agreement with the involvement of inflammatory mediators on induced atrophy, the neutralization of TNF and a reduction in oxidative stress using monomethyl fumarate, an agonist of Nrf2, decreases atrogen expression and atrophic fibers while increasing weight gain in treated mice. These data indicate that arthritogenic alphavirus infection could chronically impact body SkM composition and also harm repair machinery, contributing to a better understanding of mechanisms of arthritogenic alphavirus pathogenesis and with a description of potentially new targets of therapeutic intervention.">

Apart from three uninfected historic controls, nine Indian rhesus macaques were infected acutely with SIVmac251 and divided into three groups (n = 3 each): an untreated control and two groups treated for 20–30 days with low- (10 mg/kg/day) or high- (30 mg/kg/day) dose BLZ945. With the high-dose BLZ945 treatment, there was a significant reduction in cells expressing CD163 and CD206 across all four brain areas examined, compared with the low-dose treatment and control groups. In 9 of 11 tested regions, tissue viral DNA (vDNA) loads were reduced by 95%–99% following at least one of the two doses, and even to undetectable levels in some instances. Decreased numbers of CD163+ and CD206+ cells correlated significantly with lower levels of vDNA in all four corresponding brain areas. In contrast, BLZ945 treatment did not significantly affect the number of microglia. Our results indicate that doses as low as 10 mg/kg/day of BLZ945 are sufficient to reduce the tissue vDNA loads in the brain with no apparent adverse effect. This study provides evidence that infected PVMs are highly sensitive to CSF1R inhibition, opening new possibilities to achieve viral clearance.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most healthy individuals recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas a remarkable number continues to suffer from unexplained symptoms, known as Long COVID or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). It is therefore imperative that methods for preventing and treating the onset of PASC be investigated with the utmost urgency. Methods A mathematical model of the immune response to vaccination and viral infection with SARS-CoV-2, incorporating immune memory cells, was developed. Results and discussion Similar to our previous model, persistent infection was observed by the residual virus in the host, implying the possibility of chronic inflammation and delayed recovery from tissue injury. Pre-infectious vaccination and antiviral medication administered during onset can reduce the acute viral load; however, they show no beneficial effects in preventing persistent infection. Therefore, the impact of these treatments on the PASC, which has been clinically observed, is mainly attributed to their role in preventing severe tissue damage caused by acute viral infections. For PASC patients with persistent infection, vaccination was observed to cause an immediate rapid increase in viral load, followed by a temporary decrease over approximately one year. The former was effectively suppressed by the coadministration of antiviral medications, indicating that this combination is a promising treatment for PASC.">

        <tr id="The circulation of seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) in humans relies on effective evasion and subversion of the host immune response. While the evolution of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to avoid humoral immunity is well characterized, relatively little is known about the evolution of innate immune antagonism phenotypes in these viruses. Numerous studies have established that only a small subset of infected cells is responsible for initiating the type I and type III interferon (IFN) response during IAV infection, emphasizing the importance of single cell studies to accurately characterize the IFN response during infection. We developed a flow cytometry-based method to examine transcriptional changes in IFN and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression at the single cell level. We observed that NS segments derived from seasonal H3N2 viruses are more efficient at antagonizing IFN signaling but less effective at suppressing IFN induction, compared to the pdm2009 H1N1 lineage. We compared a collection of NS segments spanning the natural history of the current seasonal IAV lineages and demonstrate long periods of stability in IFN antagonism potential, punctuated by occasional phenotypic shifts. Altogether, our data reveal significant differences in how seasonal and pandemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses antagonize the human IFN response at the single cell level.">

Inbred mice lack the diversity inherent to people, while the microanatomical organisation of human tissue is lost in isolated cell suspensions. We describe precision-cut human lymph node (LN) slices as architecturally-preserved, functioning lymphoid tissue model system, and explore early inflammatory responses to a potent vaccine liposomal adjuvant containing a TLR4-agonist and QS21 saponin. Combining scRNA-seq, multiplexed immunofluorescence and secretome analysis, we dissect direct and indirect signalling pathways in both leukocytes and stromal cells to reveal communication networks linking innate and adaptive immunity. Application of molecular inhibitors reveals that secretion of IL-1β, but not IL-18, is TLR4-dependent in human LN. Retaining donor-to-donor immune variation, this ex vivo LN model system enables the study of pathways previously difficult to observe in humans, paving the way towards precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

        <tr id="Frequent viral infections leading to infectious disease outbreaks have become a significant global health concern. Fully elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the immune response against viral infections is crucial for epidemic prevention and control. The innate immune response, the host's primary defense against viral infection, plays a pivotal role and has become a breakthrough in research mechanisms. A component of the innate immune system, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are involved in inducing inflammatory responses to viral infections. Numerous DAMPs are released from virally infected cells, activating downstream signaling pathways via internal and external receptors on immune cells. This activation triggers immune responses and helps regulate viral host invasion. This review examines the immune regulatory mechanisms of various DAMPs, such as the S100 protein family, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and heat shock proteins, in various viral infections to provide a theoretical basis for designing novel antiviral drugs.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has been a global health concern since 2007. It primarily causes fetal microcephaly and neuronal defects through maternal transmission and induces neurological complications in adults. Recent studies report elevated proinflammatory cytokines and persistent neurological alterations post recovery, but the in vivo mechanisms remain unclear. In our study, viral RNA loads in the brains of mice infected with ZIKV peaked at 7 days post infection and returned to baseline by day 21, indicating recovery. RNA sequencing of the cerebral cortex at 7 and 21 days revealed upregulated genes related to neuroinflammation and microglial activation. Histological analyses indicated neuronal cell death and altered neurite morphology owing to severe neuroinflammation. Additionally, sustained microglial activation was associated with increased phospho-Tau levels, constituting a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings highlight how persistent microglial activation leads to neuronal dysfunction post ZIKV recovery, providing insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced brain abnormalities.">

        <tr id="The impact of community-acquired respiratory viral infections (CARVIs) in the transplant population has been highlighted by the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) following acute COVID-19 experienced significant morbidity and mortality. Few guidelines and reports suggest that HCT is deferred during persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity during and after infection, and is feasible only in fully recovered patients [1, 2]. However, those with high-risk haematological malignancies often progress and succumb to their disease without timely HCT. These two opposing pressures must therefore be reconciled, yet data are sparse on the optimal timing and safety of HCT that needs be performed during or immediately following acute COVID-19 infection. In this study at Singapore General Hospital, the largest tertiary transplant centre in Singapore, the outcome of patients who underwent HCT following COVID-19 in the preceding 120 days or with active COVID-19 infection during transplant was analysed. A retrospective analysis of transplant-related outcomes in consecutive patientsadmittedforplannedHCTbetweenSeptember2021andApril 2022 was conducted.

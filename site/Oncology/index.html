        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Bats can host viruses of pandemic concern without developing disease. The mechanisms underlying their exceptional resilience to viral infections are largely unresolved, necessitating the development of physiologically relevant and genetically tractable research models. Here, we developed respiratory and intestinal organoids that recapitulated the cellular diversity of the in vivo epithelium present in Rousettus aegyptiacus, the natural reservoir for the highly pathogenic Marburg virus (MARV). In contrast to human counterparts, bat organoids and mucosal tissue exhibited elevated constitutive expression of innate immune effectors, including type I interferon-ε (IFNε) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Upon infection with diverse zoonotic viruses, including MARV, bat organoids strongly induced type I and III IFN responses, which conferred robust antiviral protection. Type III IFNλ3 additionally displayed virus-independent self-amplification, acting as an ISG to enhance antiviral immunity. Our organoid platform reveals key features of bat epithelial antiviral immunity that may inform therapeutic strategies for viral disease resilience.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context-dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases. We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT2. Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model, revealing SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells (macrophages and T lymphocytes) and repair Schwann cells, as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve-resident cell types. Notably, endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines (Ccl9, Cxcl5) and complement components (C3, C4b, C6) in response to chronic SARM1 activation, indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non-immune nerve-resident cells. Analysis of CD45+ immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b+ macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation. We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves. Remarkably, T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model. These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1-dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease.

        <tr id="Background CNS infection by HIV-1 contributes to neuroinflammation, cognitive impairments, and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Although HIV-1 is known to enter the brain early in infection via “Trojan horse” leukocytes, including infected monocytes and CD4+T cells, the specific cellular phenotypes facilitating this process during acute infection remain incompletely characterized. Objective This study aims to characterize the roles of brain lymphocytes during acute infection and primary CD4+ T cell phenotypes seeding the SIV to the CNS. Methods scRNA-seq was performed on brain and blood cells of three acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The transcriptomic data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches and validated through in vitro co-culture assays and re-analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset. Results We found a distinct cell cluster in the brain co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, suggesting brain myeloid cells may engulf CD4+ T cells entering from the blood. This finding was confirmed in by coculture studies of macrophages and T cells, and identified specific chemokines could distinguish such cells. Acute infection induced an increase in proliferating CD4+ cytotoxic-like T cells, which had high expression of viral entry receptors and adhesion molecules, indicating their role in CNS infection. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of cytotoxic genes, MHC class II molecules, ISG15, and USP18 in brain lymphocytes, indicating a robust immune response to acute infection. Conclusion Our findings suggest that CD4+cytotoxic-like T cells represent a key lymphocyte subset responsible for initiating SIV entry into the brain and triggering neuroinflammatory processes. Furthermore, interactions between infiltrating lymphocytes and brain-resident myeloid cells may facilitate viral propagation within the CNS.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory CNS disease with heterogeneous manifestation. Prognostic markers for early classification of MS are currently under investigation. Higher diagnostic resolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to contribute significantly to patient stratification, which should be especially important for a subgroup of patients with high risk to convert to a progressive disease course. This study aimed to determine whether spectral flow cytometry of CSF cells could identify pathogenic CD4+ T cell subset in MS. Using a two-step approach, we designed a marker panel informed by publicly available transcriptomic datasets from early human MS and our own single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine MS model. Notably, chronic (‘phase’) markers such as Il7r and Ramp3 (associated with memory T cells), Itgb1 (integrin beta-1) and anti-apoptotic genes like Dnaja1, Hsph1 and Jun/AP-1 were enriched in EAE. These markers reflect pro-survival signalling and tissue-residency characteristics, including CXCR6, CD69 and Bhlhe40, which suggest an adaptation of CD4+ T cells towards persistent neuroinflammatory responses in chronic EAE. This phase-specific marker profile highlights CD4+ T cells as both indicators and contributors to disease progression in EAE. Translating these findings to MS datasets, we found an enrichment of phase-specific markers in CSF cells. Spectral flow cytometry in an independent MS cohort revealed distinct memory and effector T cell subsets, indicating unique CSF signatures in MS. This study underscores the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of CD4+ T cells detectable by spectral flow cytometry, enhancing diagnostic resolution of CSF cells and informing more precise therapeutic strategies for MS.">

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune‐stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA‐seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell–cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage–endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage‐derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage‐driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

Herein, we examined the impact of repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on T cell phenotypic and functional exhaustion in frail older adults in long-term care (n = 23), individuals on immunosuppressive drugs (n = 10), and healthy adults (n = 43), in Canada. Spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels did not decline in any cohort following repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, nor did the expression of exhaustion markers on spike-specific or total T cells increase. T cell production of multiple cytokines (i.e. polyfunctionality) in response to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 did not decline in any cohort following repeated vaccination. None of the cohorts displayed elevated levels of terminally differentiated T cells following multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Thus, repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was not associated with increased T cell exhaustion in older frail adults, immunosuppressed individuals, or healthy adults.">

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.">

        <tr id="Long COVID is a heterogeneous condition characterized by a wide range of symptoms that persist for 90 days or more following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Now more than five years out from the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the mechanisms driving Long COVID are just beginning to be elucidated. Adipose tissue has been proposed as a potential reservoir for viral persistence and tissue dysfunction contributing to symptomology seen in Long COVID. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from two cohorts: participants with subacute COVID-19 (28–89 days post-infection) compared to pre-pandemic controls, and participants with Long COVID compared to those with those classified as “indeterminate” based on the RECOVER-Adult Long COVID Research Index (12-47 months post-infection). We found no evidence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA in adipose tissue in any participant. SAT from participants with subacute COVID-19 displayed significant transcriptional remodeling, including depleted immune activation pathways and upregulated Hox genes and integrin interactions, suggesting resident immune cell exhaustion and perturbations in tissue function. However, no consistent changes in gene expression were observed between Long COVID samples and samples from indeterminant participants. Thus, SAT may contribute to inflammatory dysregulation following COVID-19, but does not appear to play a clear role in Long COVID pathophysiology. Further research is needed to clarify the role of adipose tissue in COVID-19 recovery.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 was the causing agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and massive economic losses. Although there are already several vaccines licensed, as novel variants develop, understanding the immune response induced by vaccination and natural infection is key for the development of future vaccines. Methods: In this study, we have used flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing to assess the longitudinal CD8+ T-cell response against natural infection and vaccination in convalescent and vaccinated individuals, from early activation to immune memory establishment. Moreover, we have characterized the T-cell receptor clonality and diversity at different stages post-infection and post-vaccination. Results: We have found no significant differences in CD8+ T-cell activation during the first three weeks post-infection compared to the first three weeks after first vaccination. Conversely, natural infection resulted in sustained high levels of T-cell activation at four weeks post-infection, a point in which we observed a decline in T-cell activation post-vaccination despite boosting with a second vaccination shot. Moreover, additional vaccination did not result in enhanced T-cell activation. Of note, we have observed variations in the memory subset structure at every stage of disease and vaccination. Overall, both infection and immunization induced a highly diverse T-cell receptor repertoire, which was observed both between study groups and between patients inside a given group. Conclusions: These data contribute to expand our knowledge about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination and call for additional strategies to enhance T-cell responses by booster immunization.">

        <tr id="Targeting inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major unmet need. Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2LD) selectively increases regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers in patients with coronary artery disease. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor analyses and show that IL-2LD clonally expands effector Treg cells in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The clonally expanded Treg cells upregulate key immunosuppressive and metabolic pathways and show an increased number of predicted ligand–receptor interactions. These Treg cells also display similar predicted antigen specificities, which cluster with published sequences specific to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. By tracking the T cell receptors of single cells over time, we identify an inflammatory polarization of the T cell compartment after myocardial infarction, which is restrained by IL-2LD. We identify BACH2 as a repressor of the Treg effector program. However, BACH2-mediated regulation is bypassed with IL-2LD. Overall, these results lend insight into the IL-2-driven clonal expansion program in human Treg cells, with important therapeutic implications for patients with cardiovascular and other immune-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the TEC family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, including B lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Selective BTK inhibitors (BTKi) have shown efficacy in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we investigated the role of BTK in human and mouse myeloid cells in in vitro and in vivo studies. Methods We evaluated i) the impact of the BTK inhibitor (BTKi) evobrutinib on monocyte markers for activation, costimulation, adhesion and phagocytosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from healthy and MS subjects; ii) the therapeutic effects and the action of evobrutinib on myeloid cell phenotype in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS; iii) the contribution of BTK in short-lived vs. long-lived myeloid cells to EAE expression via experiments with double transgenic mice allowing inducible inactivation of BTK in CX3CR1 expressing cells. Results We report that BTKi supported monocyte expression of VLA4/CD49d, an integrin directing immune cell migration towards the central nervous system, and CD163, a well-known scavenger receptor involved in removal of myelin debris, in samples from healthy subjects. This effect was maintained under distinct inflammatory settings and replicated with PBMC of MS subjects. Therapeutic intervention with evobrutinib ameliorated EAE severity and was associated with a significant modest decrease in the frequency of CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory macrophages. However, conditional BTK deletion in short-lived or long-lived CX3CR1-positive cells did not reduce EAE severity. Discussion This functional evidence questions the real contribution of BTK expressing myeloid cells to experimental MS.">

        <tr id="Background Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play a central role in atherosclerosis by undergoing phenotypic modulation from a quiescent, contractile state to a range of synthetic phenotypes, including fibroblast-like, macrophage-like, and lipid-laden foam cell–like states. However, a comprehensive multimodal characterization and understanding of the transcriptional programs driving these transitions remain incomplete. Methods To comprehensively define the phenotypic diversity of VSMCs during atherosclerosis progression, we performed in-depth profiling using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing in a VSMC lineage-tracing atherosclerotic mouse model. Insights from these datasets guided the design of targeted in vitro experiments to investigate candidate regulatory mechanisms. Results Single-cell multi-omics revealed extensive cellular heterogeneity within atherosclerotic plaques, including a rare population of VSMC-derived macrophage-like cells, whose presence was confirmed by histological analysis. These studies also identified a substantial population of VSMC-derived foam cells, comprising approximately 70% of all foam cells in the lesions. These cells exhibited activation of gene programs associated with lipid metabolism, proliferation, and tumor-like features. The transcription factor Bhlhe40 emerged as a key regulator of this phenotypic transition, with elevated expression in VSMC-derived foam cells during disease progression. Functional knockdown of Bhlhe40 suppressed VSMC phenotypic switching and foam cell characteristics, underscoring its potential role as a driver of VSMC modulation. Conclusions These findings advance our understanding of VSMC phenotypic modulation in atherosclerosis and highlight Bhlhe40 as a key regulator of this process. Elucidating the mechanisms governing VSMC plasticity may offer new therapeutic opportunities to reduce cardiovascular risk by targeting disease-driving cellular transitions.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is contributed by B lymphocytes, macrophages, and microglia. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an intracellular enzyme within these cells that modulates their inflammatory properties. Thus, central nervous system–penetrant inhibitors of BTK may counter immune dysregulation, and this aspiration is highlighted by 11 phase 3 clinical trials in MS to inhibit this enzyme. Despite the keen interest, the spatial and temporal elevation of BTK in lesions of MS and its models is not well characterized. Methods We used quantitative fluorescence immunohistology to assess the expression of BTK and a phosphorylated activated form in different lesion types of MS and 3 of its models: inflammatory experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), toxin-induced demyelination of lysolecithin, and oxidized phosphatidylcholine injuries. GDC-0853 (fenebrutinib), a BTK inhibitor in phase 3 clinical trials in MS, was evaluated in EAE for its capacity to alter disease course. Results We observed low expression of BTK and a phosphorylated form (pBTK) in murine spinal cord but significant upregulation in white matter lesions inflicted by oxidized phosphatidylcholine, lysolecithin, and EAE. Expression predominantly localized to microglia/macrophages shown through colocalization analysis by Imaris 3-dimensional rendering. GDC-0853 (fenebrutinib) significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE when administered prophylactically and marginally ameliorated disability when initiated from onset of clinical disability. Finally, we report the increase in BTK expression in microglia/macrophages in active plaques and in the hypercellular rim of chronic active lesions of MS. In the inactive core of chronic active MS lesions, the few remaining HLA-DR+ myeloid cells were still BTK immunoreactive. Discussion Our results demonstrate that BTK immunoreactivity is normally undetectable in uninjured areas or normal-appearing white matter of human and murine CNS, but that expression becomes prominent in lesions with hypercellular aggregates of microglia and macrophages. Staining for pBTK reveals that its upregulation declines in the later stage of lysolecithin and chronic stage of EAE injury while BTK upregulation is maintained. Our collective results support the rationale of using brain-penetrant BTK inhibitors to modulate the elevation of this enzyme in microglia/macrophages within inflamed plaques of MS.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Recent documented infection with an endemic coronavirus (eCoV) is associated with less severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet the immune mechanism behind this protection has not been fully explored. We measured both antibody and T-cell responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals, classified into two groups: those with or without presumed recent eCoV infections. There was no difference in neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens between the two groups. SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals with recent presumed eCoV infection, however, had higher and significantly correlated levels of Fc receptor (FcR)-binding antibodies against eCoV spikes (S) and SARS-CoV-2 S2. Recent eCoV infection boosts cross-reactive antibodies that can mediate Fc effector functions, and this may play a role in the observed heterotypic immune protection against severe COVID-19. IMPORTANCE With the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses, it is important to understand how the immune system may protect against disease from future coronavirus outbreaks. We investigated the adaptive immune responses elicited from a “common cold” eCoV and measured the cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals classified as having or not having a recent eCoV infection. Although both groups had similar cross-reactive T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses, individuals with a recent eCoV infection had higher antibody levels capable of Fc receptor binding. Antibodies with enhanced Fc receptor binding could mediate the killing of virally infected cells through mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, which may reduce the severity of COVID-19. Antibodies capable of mediating Fc effector functions may be critical for therapies and vaccines against future pathogenic coronavirus outbreaks.

        <tr id="Immune responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) following influenza A virus (IAV) infection can influence disease severity, and subsequently inflammation and lung tissue damage in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). This study investigated the role of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a key pattern recognition receptor that senses viral RNA and triggers antiviral and proinflammatory signaling to activate immune responses, in specifically shaping URT and LRT immune responses to IAV infection. Wild type C57Bl/6 and TLR7 knockout (TLR7 KO) mice were infected with the H3N2 IAV strain Hk-X31, and key immune responses in the nasal tissue (URT) and lower airways and lung tissue (LRT) measured after acute infection. We found reduced body weight loss, and increased type II/III interferons and proinflammatory cytokines in the URT of TLR7 KO mice; while LRT inflammation was reduced. TLR7 was essential for activating immune responses in the LRT but played a more selective role in the URT, primarily influencing monocytes, pDCs and B cells. Our data suggest that TLR7 plays a critical role in the transition of inflammation from the URT to the LRT during IAV infection, making it a promising therapeutic target to modulate disease severity.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a heterogeneous infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The distinctive features of COVID-19 infection encompass a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe illness involving diverse underlying pathophysiological processes such as hyperinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic microangiopathies, and multiple organ failure. However, the host responses to COVID-19, including systemic inflammation and immunity against SARS-CoV-2, remain largely undefined across different disease states. Here, we performed global transcriptome profiling of 228 peripheral blood samples of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations and subsequent clustering using an unsupervised algorithm. We identified various transcriptomic clusters and globally dysregulated immune-related pathways, leading to distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles in severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This underscores the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release. Additionally, our results reveal variances in circulating cell populations and the activation of apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients with diverse clinical presentations offers valuable insights into molecular mechanisms and may inform clinical decisions on anti-inflammatory therapies.

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular complications are a hallmark of Post-Acute Sequelae of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC), yet the mechanisms driving persistent cardiac dysfunction remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction in immune cells as a key contributor. This study investigated whether CD14++ monocytes from long COVID patients exhibit bioenergetic impairment, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, and defective oxidative stress adaptation, which may underlie cardiovascular symptoms in PASC. CD14++ monocytes were isolated from 14 long COVID patients with cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, angina) and 10 age-matched controls with similar cardiovascular risk profiles. Mitochondrial function was assessed using a Seahorse Agilent Analyzer under basal conditions and after oxidative stress induction with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured via Tetramethylrhodamine Ethyl Ester (TMRE) assay, mtDNA integrity via qPCR, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dynamics via Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Parallel experiments exposed healthy monocytes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to evaluate direct viral effects. CD14++ monocytes from long COVID patients with cardiovascular symptoms (n = 14) exhibited profound mitochondrial dysfunction compared to age-matched controls (n = 10). Under oxidative stress induced by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), long COVID monocytes failed to upregulate basal respiration (9.5 vs. 30.4 pmol/min in controls, p = 0.0043), showed a 65% reduction in maximal respiration (p = 0.4035, ns) and demonstrated a 70% loss of spare respiratory capacity (p = 0.4143, ns) with significantly impaired adaptation to BSO challenge (long COVID + BSO: 9.9 vs. control + BSO: 54 pmol/min, p = 0.0091). Proton leak, a protective mechanism against ROS overproduction, was blunted in long COVID monocytes (3-fold vs. 13-fold elevation in controls, p = 0.0294). Paradoxically, long COVID monocytes showed reduced ROS accumulation after BSO treatment (6% decrease vs. 1.2-fold increase in controls, p = 0.0015) and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (157 vs. 113.7 TMRE fluorescence, p = 0.0179), which remained stable under oxidative stress. mtDNA analysis revealed severe depletion (80% reduction, p < 0.001) and region-specific damage, with 75% and 70% reductions in amplification efficiency for regions C and D (p < 0.05), respectively. In contrast, exposure of healthy monocytes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein did not recapitulate these defects, with preserved basal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity, though coupling efficiency under oxidative stress was reduced (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID syndrome arises from maladaptive host responses rather than direct viral toxicity, characterized by bioenergetic failure, impaired stress adaptation, and mitochondrial genomic instability. This study identifies persistent mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID monocytes as a critical driver of cardiovascular complications in PASC. Key defects—bioenergetic failure, impaired stress adaptation and mtDNA damage—correlate with clinical symptoms like heart failure and exercise intolerance. The stable elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential and resistance to ROS induction suggest maladaptive remodeling of mitochondrial physiology. These findings position mitochondrial resilience as a therapeutic target, with potential strategies including antioxidants, mtDNA repair agents or metabolic modulators. The dissociation between spike protein exposure and mitochondrial dysfunction highlights the need to explore host-directed mechanisms in PASC pathophysiology. This work advances our understanding of long COVID cardiovascular sequelae and provides a foundation for biomarker development and targeted interventions to mitigate long-term morbidity.">

        <tr id="Long‐term consequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are unknown since recovered individuals can experience symptoms and latent viral reactivation for months. Indeed, acute post‐infection sequelae have also been observed in other respiratory viral infections, including influenza. To characterize post‐COVID‐19 and post‐influenza induced alterations to the cellular immunome, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients 3 months after recovery from COVID‐19 (n = 93) or influenza (n = 25), and from pre‐pandemic healthy controls (n = 25). PBMCs were characterized using a 40‐plex mass cytometry panel. Principal component analysis (PCA), classification models, and K‐means clustering were subsequently applied. PCA identified distinct immune profiles between cohorts, with both post‐COVID and post‐flu patients displaying an altered chemokine receptor expression compared to pre‐pandemic healthy controls. These alterations were more prominent in post‐COVID patients since they exhibited highly increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6 by various lymphoid populations, while post‐influenza patients mainly showed a decrease in CCR4 expression by naïve T cells, monocytes, and conventional dendritic cells. Classification models using immunophenotyping data confirm the three groups, while K‐means clustering revealed two subgroups among post‐COVID patients, with younger patients showing more pronounced immune alterations in the chemokine receptor profile, independently of long COVID symptoms. In conclusion, post‐COVID and post‐influenza patients exhibit distinct and unique persistent immune alterations. Understanding these altered immune profiles can guide targeted therapies for post‐COVID syndrome and highlight differences in immune recovery from various respiratory infections.">

        <tr id="The 2024 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle presented an unprecedented scenario where the virus infected bovine mammary glands and was detected in milk, raising serious concerns for public health and the dairy industry. Unlike previously described subclinical influenza A virus (IAV) infections in cattle, H5N1 infection induced severe clinical symptoms, including respiratory distress, mastitis, and abnormal milk production. To understand the host immune responses and changes, particularly in the mammary gland, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on bovine milk somatic cells (bMSCs) in vitro exposed to an H5N1 isolate from an infected dairy farm. We identified ten distinct cell clusters and observed a shift toward type-2 immune responses, characterized by T cells expressing IL13 and GATA3, and three different subtypes of epithelial cells based on the expression of genes associated with milk production. Our study revealed temporal dynamics in cytokine expression, with a rapid decline in luminal epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages and dendritic cells, suggesting a role in increased antigen presentation. While viral RNA was detected in bulk-exposed bMSC samples via qRT-PCR, no viral reads were observed in the scRNA-seq data, indicating that the immune responses captured may be due to exposure to viral components rather than productive infection. This research fills a critical gap in understanding the immune responses of bovine mammary glands to H5N1 exposure and highlights the need for further investigation into therapeutic strategies for managing such outbreaks.">

We aimed to examine associations between immune senescence, T and B cell clonal diversity and immunoglobulin G secretion in response to immune challenge in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from people of different chronological ages. We isolated PBMC from 49 individuals categorised into < 35 years and > 60 years age groups. Cells were then challenged with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or vehicle and IMMAX score was calculated for each sample from flow cytometry. Antibody response was assessed using the proxy of IgG secretion and T cell receptor and immunoglobulin framework region recombination was determined by clonality studies. We observed that individuals aged > 60 years demonstrated a higher immune ‘age’ as calculated by IMMAX score (0.75 compared with 0.48 for individuals aged < 35 years; p = < 0.0001). Immune age negatively correlated with IgG responsivity in older individuals with recent prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (b = -0.01; p = 0.05). Higher immune age was also negatively correlated with TCR Vd + Jd receptor diversity regardless of immune challenge (b = -0.02; p = < 0.0001 and b = -0.02; r2 = 0.0.35; p = < 0.0001 for control and exposed samples respectively). Our data demonstrate that PBMC samples from older people display a higher cellular immune age and attenuation of immune response. This suggests that future treatments targeting cellular ageing of immune cells may be a useful avenue for investigation to improve immune function in older people.

        <tr id="Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by episodic relapses of neurological symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of patients is key to prevent relapses and irreversible damage to the CNS. However, development of therapies targeting early MS is constrained by the lack of knowledge of early MS disease pathogenesis. In RRMS, nervous tissue damage is induced by CNS-infiltrating immune cells, including T cells. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the early events of CNS infiltration by T cells in RRMS, including their interaction with astrocytes and brain endothelial cells. Using a human in vitro model system and tissue samples obtained from newly diagnosed patients and healthy individuals, we found that CD8+CD20+ T cells could cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid-barrier in the absence of inflammation. As CD8+CD20+ T cells are present in the CNS before inflammation and are highly enriched in MS lesions once the disease is initiated, they may be among the first effector cells in RRMS. Our study also showed that CD4+CD20+ T cells can stimulate brain endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules and chemokines needed for peripheral immune cells to adhere and migrate through the BBB, and stimulate astrocytes to produce chemokines directing transmigrating cells to the site of inflammation. This suggests that CD4+CD20+ T cells, once migrated to the CNS, strengthens the infiltration of immune cells to the CNS and hereby amplify CNS inflammation. Altogether, this indicates that CD20+ T cells play a role in the early phases of MS-inflammation and therefore are candidate targets for early treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) is a severe condition that may follow sepsis and is characterized by ongoing inflammation and immune suppression, diminishing quality of life and potentially causing death. The role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in PICS, despite their association with thrombopoiesis, is not well understood. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile MKs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from 11 patients, including six with PICS, five with sepsis, and five healthy controls, to determine the diversity and molecular signatures of the MKs. Five subgroups of MKs are identified (MK1-MK5), and their proportions vary across the groups. MK1 and MK2 are predominant in PICS. Gene Ontology analysis shows that genes related to antigen processing and presentation and IL-17 signaling are enriched in MK1, whereas genes associated with platelet degranulation and neutrophil activation are enriched in MK2. Moreover, the expression level of CCL5 is markedly increased in MKs. Ligand-receptor analysis reveals dynamic interactions among MKs and T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages, suggesting a broad role of MKs in immune homeostasis. In PICS model mice, MKs regulate systemic inflammation by reducing the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A and promoting lung tissue repair. Our findings establish MKs as essential components of the immune system in PICS and provide new insights into their potential as therapeutic targets for post-sepsis immune dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a prevalent condition whose recurrence leads to multiple adverse effects. Previous studies on INS pathogenesis primarily focused on immune dysregulation, particularly T-cell changes and their correlation with cytokine shifts. Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell dysfunction also plays a role. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effective treatment strategies remains incomplete. Methods This study investigates changes in gene expressions and cellular interactions of immune cells at a single-cell level using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). And subsequently validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. Results We identified seven main clusters using unsupervised clustering of 103,213 high-quality single cells. Through unsupervised clustering, patient-specific T cells (IFI44L + CD4 + T cells) that exhibited a pronounced elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is identified. Activation of ISGs and interferon (IFN)-related pathways are also observed in other clusters. Specifically, this study demonstrates that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role by promoting the interaction between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and receptors on B cells. This interaction triggers the release of autoantibodies, thereby initiating INS pathogenesis. Furthermore, telitacicept has shown efficacy in treating pediatric patients with frequent relapse NS(FRNS). Conclusions Overall, our findings underscore the role of interferon and its related pathways in INS pathogenesis, providing novel therapeutic interventions for NS.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has underscored the need to understand the virus’s evolution due to its global health impact. This study employed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to analyze gene expression differences across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We used publicly available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with IDs GSE157103, GSE171110, GSE189039, and GSE201530, which contain RNA-Seq data extracted from white blood cells, whole blood, or PBMCs of individuals infected with the Original Wuhan variant (both hospitalized and non-hospitalized), the French variant (hospitalized), the Beta variant (hospitalized), and the Omicron variant (moderate and mild cases), along with COVID-negative controls. Our first objective was to examine differences in gene expression dynamics using Generalized Linear Models with Quasi-Likelihood F-tests and the Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (GLMQL-MAS) technique, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. Our second objective was to employ Cross-MAS to identify a robust set of genes indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the variant and to assess their classification performance. GO and pathway analyses revealed a significant evolutionary shift in how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host. Early variants such as the Original Wuhan and French cases primarily affected pathways related to viral replication, including Eukaryotic Translation Elongation and Viral mRNA Translation. In contrast, later variants like Beta and Omicron showed a strategic shift toward modulating and evading the host immune response, engaging immune-related pathways such as Interferon Alpha/Beta signaling and Cytokine signaling in the immune system. To evaluate the classification potential of the identified genes, we tested them on held-out datasets GSE152418, PMC8202013, GSE161731, and GSE166190, which contain RNA-Seq data from whole blood or PBMCs of COVID-positive and healthy individuals. Using top-ranked genes such as IFI27, CDC20, RRM2, HJURP, and CDC45 in linear models including logistic regression and linear SVM, we achieved 97.31% accuracy, with precision and recall rates of 0.97 and 0.99, respectively. These signatures also achieved perfect classification (100% accuracy, precision, and recall) in two additional datasets: GSE294888, which includes blood-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (DC2s) stimulated with Delta or Omicron variants, and GSE239595, which features Omicron-infected nasopharyngeal tissue. These findings demonstrate the potential of transcriptomic signatures for variant-agnostic COVID-19 detection and provide a foundation for flexible diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in response to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="In this comprehensive review, we delve into the significant body of research on single-cell transcriptomics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to understand neurological diseases with autoimmune, neurodegenerative, infectious, or oncogenic origins. We thoroughly examine all published studies in these areas, with a particular focus on multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. For these diseases, we review findings related to immune cells that infiltrate the brain, based on postmortem brain tissue analyses and include CSF cytometry findings. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), and single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) are increasingly vital tools for studying CSF to understand various aspects of neurological diseases. These advanced techniques allow researchers to explore the etiopathogenesis of these conditions by identifying the roles and interactions of different immune cells. scRNA-seq provides detailed insights into the gene expression profiles of individual cells, revealing how specific cell types contribute to disease progression. scTCR-seq and scBCR-seq enable the study of clonal expansion in T and B cells, respectively, and facilitate antigen prediction, helping to uncover the nature of antigens that trigger adaptive immune responses. By integrating these technologies, scientists can define new therapeutic targets and categorize patients, leading to more personalized and effective treatments. This review highlights the promising advancements and addresses the current limitations of single-cell transcriptomics in the context of CSF and neurological diseases, setting the stage for future breakthroughs.">

To investigate the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, seven SIV+ rhesus macaques were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 in all macaques was mild. SARS-CoV-2 replication persisted in the upper, but not the lower respiratory tract for 14 days post-infection. Animals showed impaired generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cells. Animals also displayed transient changes in microbial communities in the upper airway and gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 evolution was observed in the upper respiratory tract. This study demonstrates that SIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in rhesus macaques recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in PLWH. We show that SIV impairs anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, potentially leading to prolonged viral shedding, altered pathogenesis, and viral evolution. This highlights the importance of HIV status in COVID-19 and supports the use of this model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive, human-specific commensal infectious pathogen, poses a significant global health threat, especially in children under five, often resulting in fatalities. The intricacies of the immune response in pneumococcal meningitis (PM) remain elusive, necessitating a meticulous examination of immune cell subsets at the single-cell resolution. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PM patients and healthy individuals. We found significant relative changes in the compositions of immune cell subset, with significant relative increases in platelets, neutrophils, and their precursors, alongside relative decreases in natural killer (NK) cells, T cell subtypes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PM patients. Functional enrichment analyses revealed an up-regulation of neutrophils-related immune genes across multiple immune cell types, including platelets, myeloid cells and B cells, suggesting excessive neutrophil activation. However, a down-regulation of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation in myeloid cells and B cells in the PM group indicated a relative dampening of the adaptive immune response in the PM patients. This was further corroborated by the reduced proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T cells. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxity were down-regulated in both NK cells and T cells, alongside impaired T cell activation. Notably, distinct B cell subtypes, including unique naïve B cell clusters, demonstrated differentially expressed genes associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of immune responses in PM. The identified cellular and molecular signatures offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention and provide a foundation for further investigation into the immunopathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis.">

We applied a multidimensional approach to decipher the immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infected infants (n = 26; 10 subacute, 11 moderate and 5 severe disease; median age = 1.6 months) and matched controls (n = 14; median age = 2 months). Single cell (scRNA-seq) profiling of PBMCs revealed substantial alterations in cell composition in SARS-CoV-2 infected infants; with most cell-types switching to an interferon-stimulated gene (ISGhi) state including: (i) CD14+ monocytes co-expressing ISGs and inflammasome-related molecules, (ii) ISGhi naive CD4+ T cells, (iii) ISGhi proliferating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and (iv) ISGhi naive and transitional B cells. We observe increased serum concentrations of both interferons and inflammatory cytokines in infected infants. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are also consistently detected in the absence of anti-IFN autoantibodies. Compared with infected adults, infants display a similar ISG signature in monocytes but a markedly enhanced ISG signature in T and B cells. These findings provide insights into the distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of life and underscore the importance of further defining the unique features of early life immunity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), continues to circulate globally despite the widespread vaccination and therapeutics like Paxlovid, remdesivir, and molnupiravir. COVID-19 is associated with both respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations, with persistent intestinal pathology contributing to the post-COVID-19 condition. We have previously demonstrated the antiviral activity of autophagy-blocking drugs, such as Berbamine dihydrochloride, against intestinal SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. In addition, the autophagy blockers restored the barrier function of infected intestinal epithelium. In this addendum, using human intestinal organoids, we present evidence for a protective role of intrinsic higher levels of autophagy flux in limiting intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological treatment with Akt inhibitor MK-2206 hydrochloride suppressed viral entry into the intestinal epithelium. This antiviral effect of MK-2206 was shown to be dependent on Synaptosomal-associated protein 29-dependent (SNAP-29)-mediated autophagy flux. Furthermore, extrinsically enhanced autophagy with MK-2206 also prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced intestinal barrier damage. Our findings thus underscore the intricate role of autophagy pathways in the dissemination and pathogenesis of intestinal SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the therapeutic potential of host-directed therapies targeting autophagy to intervene in COVID-19-associated sequelae and improve intestinal health.">

        <tr id="Introduction The chronic nature of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) allows it to coexist with diverse pathologies. However, it remains unclear whether immune alterations associated with LTBI influence COVID-19 coinfection and patient outcomes. This study aims to compare the immune phenotype of patients with LTBI/COVID-19 to those with COVID-19 alone, in order to assess whether latent tuberculosis infection induces significant immune cell alterations. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured and stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (M. bovis BCG) to evaluate cellular distribution and function. Results the LTBI/COVID-19 group exhibited a narrower range of symptoms and required less complex treatment regimens than the COVID-19 group. The cellular evaluation revealed that individuals with COVID-19 displayed a distinct immune profile, characterized by a predominance of monocytes expressing pro-inflammatory and regulatory markers, including TNFR2, HLA-DR+TNFR2, and CD71. While CD4+ T cell subpopulation distribution and function were similar across groups, LTBI/COVID-19 and COVID-19 exhibited similar frequencies of CD8+perforin+ and CD8+Granzime B+ T cells. However, LTBI/COVID-19 displays lower soluble levels of granzyme B and perforin in culture supernatants and perforin, granulysin, and sFas in plasma compared to COVID-19. Notably, CD8+ T cells from LTBI/COVID-19 showed higher antigen-specific degranulation than COVID-19. Moreover, LTBI/COVID-19 individuals predominantly displayed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with highly polarized, compact mitochondria at baseline, which remained unchanged under stimulation. In contrast, COVID-19 had T cells with highly polarized, fragmented mitochondria at baseline, a profile that persisted under stimulation. Conclusion The findings reveal significant alterations in monocytes and T cells of individuals with LTBI/COVID-19, suggesting that co-infection may induce changes in the cellular phenotype and cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS. Clemastine fumarate, the over-the-counter antihistamine and muscarinic receptor blocker, has remyelinating potential in MS. A clemastine arm was added to an ongoing platform clinical trial, targeting residual activity by precision, biomarker-guided combination therapies of multiple sclerosis (TRAP-MS) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03109288), to identify a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remyelination signature and to collect safety data on clemastine in patients progressing independently of relapse activity (PIRA). The clemastine arm was stopped per protocol-defined criteria when 3 of 9 patients triggered individual safety stopping criteria. Clemastine-treated patients had significantly higher treatment-induced disability progression slopes compared with the remaining TRAP-MS participants. Quantification of approximately 7,000 proteins in CSF samples collected before and after clemastine treatment showed significant increases in purinergic signaling and pyroptosis. Mechanistic studies showed that clemastine with sublytic doses of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activates inflammasome and induces pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. Clemastine with ATP also caused pyroptosis of induced pluripotent stem cell–derived human oligodendrocytes. Antagonist of the purinergic channel P2RX7, which is strongly expressed in oligodendrocytes and myeloid cells, blocked these toxic effects of clemastine. Finally, reanalysis of published single-nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) studies revealed increased P2RX7 expression and pyroptosis transcriptional signature in microglia and oligodendrocytes in the MS brain, especially in chronic active lesions. The CSF proteomic pyroptosis score was increased in untreated MS patients, was higher in patients with progressive than relapsing-remitting disease, and correlated significantly with the rates of MS progression. Collectively, this identifies pyroptosis as a likely mechanism of CNS injury underlying PIRA even outside of clemastine toxicity.">

        <tr id="Introduction The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (XBB.1.5) variants, has substantially influenced the clinical and immunological landscape of COVID-19. This study investigates the differential pathogenicity and immune responses in a feline model infected with these variants, focusing on neutrophil activation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and cytokine profiles. Methods Eight pathogen-free cats were inoculated with B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2 (n=3), XBB.1.5 (Omicron) SARS-CoV-2 (n=3), or vehicle (n=2), and clinical assessments, histopathological examinations, and cytokine analyses were performed post-infection. Results Results demonstrate that Delta-infected cats exhibit more severe clinical manifestations characterized by significant elevation in respiratory effort, wheezing, and systemic inflammation compared to Omicron-infected cats, which show milder symptoms, primarily confined to the upper respiratory tract. Histopathological findings suggest pronounced lung damage in Delta-infected cats, whereas Omicron infection resulted in localized pathology. Cytokine profiling demonstrates heightened proinflammatory responses, particularly in Delta-infected cats, characterized by elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α while Omicron infection results in less pronounced inflammatory responses. Moreover, neutrophil-related parameters, including total neutrophil counts and banded neutrophils, were significantly elevated in Delta-infected cats, correlating with enhanced NET formation as evidenced by increased NETs-related markers MPO, NE, and citrullinated H3, and NET-specific markers MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free DNA. Discussion This study underscores the importance of variant-specific immune responses and highlights the need for targeted therapeutic strategies that mitigate severe lung injury associated with Delta infection, while also considering the distinct immune dynamics observed with the Omicron variant. Furthermore, results support the importance of delineating immune responses concerning future variants. These findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in companion animals and inform public health strategies as new variants continue to emerge.">

        <tr id="Atherosclerosis (AS), the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases, is a chronic inflammatory disorder involving lipid metabolism, immune dysregulation, and cell death. Pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory programmed cell death, is implicated in AS progression, yet its molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential remain incompletely understood. A multi-omics framework integrating transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to identify and prioritize pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in AS. Functional enrichment, immune infiltration profiling, and protein–protein interaction network analyses were conducted. Experimental validation was conducted using in vitro and in vivo models. Thirty-six PRGs were identified, with TREM2, TNF, MMP9, IL1B, and CASP1 emerging as key regulators of pyroptosis and inflammation. These PRGs demonstrated robust diagnostic potential in internal and external datasets. Immune infiltration analysis stratified AS patients into subtypes, with Cluster 2 characterized by elevated macrophage pyroptosis and a pro-inflammatory immune microenvironment. Single-cell analysis confirmed TREM2 upregulation in macrophages and monocytes, linking it to immune activation and plaque instability. Experimental validation revealed TREM2’s dual role in promoting macrophage lipid accumulation and pyroptosis. This study establishes PRGs, particularly TREM2, as critical modulators of AS progression. These findings enhance our understanding of pyroptosis in AS and provide a framework for developing PRG-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is associated with milder COVID-19 symptoms than previous strains. This study analyzed alterations in natural killer (NK) cell-associated immunity dynamics in mild and moderate COVID-19 cases during the Omicron phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients aged ≥16 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalized at Tottori University Hospital between January 2022 and May 2022. A total of 27 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 11 and 16 were diagnosed with mild and moderate COVID-19, respectively, based on the Japanese COVID-19 clinical practice guideline. Peripheral blood NK cell subsets and surface markers, including the activating receptor NKG2D and the inhibitory receptor TIGIT, as well as serum levels of 24 immunoregulatory markers, such as cytokines and cytotoxic mediators, were measured at admission and recovery. In addition, to explore immune patterns associated with disease severity, differences in 24 serum markers and soluble UL16-binding protein 2 (sULBP2) at the clinically most symptomatic time point during hospitalization were visualized using a volcano plot and analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Results Patients with mild COVID-19 exhibited expanded subsets of unconventional CD56dimCD16- NK cells with elevated NKG2D expression and lower levels of cytotoxic mediators (granzyme A, granzyme B, and granulysin). In contrast, patients with moderate disease exhibited NK cell exhaustion, characterized by upregulation of TIGIT, along with increased levels of NK cell-associated cytokines and cytotoxic mediators. The volcano plot identified that the patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited significantly elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed that IL-6, IFN-γ, soluble Fas, and CXCL8 were correlated with increased sULBP2. The PCA identified distinct clusters based on disease severity. Conclusions The results of study highlight the differences in NK cell-associated immune alterations between mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. Elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels, along with their correlations with inflammatory mediators, reflects differences in immune response based on disease severity. These findings provide insight into the immune response to infection caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and improve our understanding of its immunological features.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, viral mutations have posed significant challenges in identifying therapeutic targets and developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Post-translational modifications of genes involved in interferon production and signaling pathways play a crucial role in regulating interferon responses. In this study, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 screening based on adenine base editors to investigate functional amino acids in 1,278 innate immune-related genes. This approach, which converts A-T base pairs into G-C base pairs to probe the functional importance of specific amino acids, allowed us to identify 17 vital factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the candidate genes, genetic knockdown of EHMT2 exhibited the strongest antiviral effect. Further analysis revealed that UNC0638, a selective inhibitor of EHMT2, significantly reduced the endosomal entry of SARS-CoV-2 in pseudovirus assays. The observed inhibitory effect was consistently observed across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Mechanistically, UNC0638 reduced mature cathepsin L (CTSL) levels, impairing the proteolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and subsequent membrane fusion, a critical step for viral entry. Our findings uncover EHMT2 as a host dependency factor and reveal the antiviral mechanism of EHMT2 inhibitors through CTSL maturation blockade. These results advance the understanding of host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a strategic framework for developing host-targeted antiviral therapies. IMPORTANCE In this study, we demonstrated that knockdown or knockout of EHMT2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection, and inhibitors of EHMT2, including UNC0638, UNC0642, and BIX01294 showed similar restrictive effects. Mechanistically, the EHMT2 inhibitor UNC0638 restricts spike-mediated cell entry by inhibiting the maturation of CTSL, a critical protease required for SARS-CoV-2 entry via the endosomal pathway. Importantly, CTSL is not only essential for SARS-CoV-2 but also plays a key role in the entry of other coronaviruses that utilize similar pathways. Therefore, EHMT2 inhibitors could have broader applications as pan-coronavirus therapeutic agents.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a major health emergency since its emergence in late 2019. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of COVID-19, leading to severe illness, i.e. coagulopathy, multi-organ failure. FX06, a fibrin-derived peptide naturally occurring in the human body, formerly known as Bβ15-42, is a promising therapeutic candidate for endothelial complications like capillary leakage in COVID-19 and other forms of acute respiratory disorders. The aim of this project is to investigate whether FX06 can attenuate COVID-19 cytokine-triggered inflammatory processes in vitro. Methods To mimic the inflammatory status of COVID-19, a human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell line (ECs) – HULEC-5a, was treated with a cytokine cocktail comprised of ten different cytokines or chemokines at concentrations found in serum profiles of COVID-19 patients with severe illness, further referred to as the severe cytokine cocktail. ECs were treated with the severe cytokine cocktail for 24 h, in the absence or presence of FX06 for 2 h. Results The severe cytokine cocktail enhanced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-endothelial adhesion and monolayer transmigration. This deleterious effect was significantly reduced by FX06. FX06 was also shown to mitigate the cytotoxic activity of allogeneic CD8+ T cells, which increased upon cytokine treatment. FX06 restored continuous vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin/CD144 distribution on the EC surface and reversed morphological changes mediated by the severe cytokine cocktail, such as the elongation of F-actin stress fibers. FX06 reduced capillary-like structure formation of the severe cytokine cocktail treated-ECs, indicating FX06 down-regulated the pro-inflammatory angiogenic activity caused by the severe cytokine cocktail. Additionally, FX06 might assist in maintaining the normal barrier function of ECs by altering the surface expression of Syndecan-1 (SDC1/CD138). Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses demonstrated that FX06 in the presence of the severe cytokine cocktail inactivated RhoGTPase, which was confirmed by western blotting that FX06 attenuated RhoA, a member of RhoGTPase, enhanced by the severe cytokine cocktail and down-regulated the expression of the phosphorylated downstream protein, ROCK1. Conclusion Overall, FX06 shows promising potential in normalizing ECs and reducing vascular leakage to protect the endothelium against the proinflammatory effect of COVID-19-triggered cytokines.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound impact on global health, with nearly 800 million cases reported in the Americas alone. The clinical presentation of the disease is highly variable, with approximately half of all patients experiencing severe symptoms. This variability confounds the complex interplay between immune responses and disease severity. Severe cases are often characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. Over 88% of COVID-19 patients have multiple comorbidities; factors such as age and pre-existing conditions further modulate immune responses and contribute to the severity of the disease. While some studies have reported differences in cytokine profiles between severity groups, larger, well-designed cohorts are needed to clarify these relationships. Natural Killer cells, which are critical for the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2, are often impaired and contribute to immune exhaustion. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 evades innate immune defenses through accessory proteins that inhibit interferon signaling and exacerbate cytokine storms and inflammation. This integrative review aims to synthesize findings from 2020 onward and provide insights into the innate immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and their contributions to disease pathogenesis. Understanding cytokine dynamics, NK cell behaviors, and viral immune evasion strategies is critical for advancing therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="The Global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 was initiated by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In addition to conventional pulmonary lesions, a range of neurological injury symptoms have been identified in clinical practice, but the aetiology of neurological disorders linked to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection remains poorly understood. Syrian hamsters, which are highly susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, exhibit a disease phenotype similar to that observed in human COVID‐19 patients. In this study, a hamster model of COVID‐19 infection was used to analyze molecular changes in different tissues at various time points post infection with distinct strains using proteomic and phosphoproteomic approaches. Multi‐omics analysis showed that SARS‐COV‐2 infection triggers sustained downregulation of the abundance and phosphorylation levels of neuronal and synapse‐associated proteins in the brain, suggesting that neuronal damage persists even during the recovery period. Additionally, infections with SARS‐CoV‐2 may contribute to the onset of long‐term symptoms of COVID‐19 by impacting energy metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic transmission pathways. This study provides a comprehensive molecular profile of hamsters infected with different SARS‐CoV‐2 strains in different tissues, offering foundational insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID‐19.">

Surprisingly, we identified a pleocytosis in the CSF, most pronounced in patients with early PD. Single-cell RNAseq revealed increases in CSF-specific microglia-like macrophages expressing JAK-STAT and TNFα signaling signatures in prodromal PD, with a lack of T cell activation in the CSF. The CSF macrophages exhibited similar transcriptional profiles to dural macrophages from human α-synuclein-expressing PD model mice. These findings uncover a myeloid-mediated TNFα inflammatory process in the CNS of patients with prodromal PD, suggesting a novel pathological mechanism in disease etiology.">

We analyzed blood samples from 210 COVID-19 patients and the control group consisted of 80 healthy individuals. Results revealed the miRNA expression pattern has the potential to predict the severity of COVID-19, reflecting the clinical symptoms of the infection, such as the need for oxygen therapy and concomitant pneumonia. In particular, low expression of miRNAs miR106a-5p, miR17-5p, miR181a-5p, miR191-5p, miR20a-5p and miR451a, especially in the initial phase of the disease, is associated with an unfavorable clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection (admission to the ICU).">

        <tr id="Background Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) triggers a dynamic immune response involving macrophages, However, the functional heterogeneity of these cells and the mechanisms through which they promote repair remain unclear. Although the neuropeptide CGRP has been shown to modulate macrophage phenotypes in other pathological contexts, its role in ICH recovery and white matter repair remains unexplored. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45 + cells from ICH mice (GSE167593 and GSE230414 datasets) identified macrophage subsets. Flow cytometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), behavioral assays, and immunofluorescence validated macrophage dynamics and white matter (WM) integrity. Bone marrow and skull analyses traced macrophage origins. The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was tested via intraperitoneal administration in ICH mice, with outcomes assessed through transcriptomics, ultrastructural imaging, and functional recovery. Results scRNA-seq revealed sustained accumulation of THBS1 + macrophages post-ICH, correlating with WM repair and neurological recovery. These macrophages exhibited pro-repair and remyelination gene signatures (e.g., Arg1, Tgm2). Bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, particularly skull-resident populations, served as the primary source of THBS1 + macrophages. CGRP, elevated in meninges and bone marrow post-ICH, drove macrophage polarization toward THBS + phenotypes. CGRP administration expanded THBS1-positive macrophages in the bone marrow and brain, improving WM integrity (reduced radial diffusivity, higher fractional anisotropy) and sensorimotor function. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed enhanced myelin regeneration (lower g-ratio) in CGRP-treated mice. Conclusions This study identifies a neuroimmune axis wherein CGRP promotes bone marrow-derived THBS1 + macrophages to facilitate WM repair and functional recovery after ICH. Targeting CGRP-macrophage signaling offers a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery in hemorrhagic brain injury.

        <tr id="Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may present with a wide clinical spectrum, including extrapulmonary involvement, such as neurological damage. Although the pathogenesis of neurological COVID-19 still remains unclear, some studies have discussed the potential association between tissue injury and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and/or immune imbalance. These two mechanisms are non-mutually exclusive; however, exacerbated inflammatory-response-induced neurological damage appears to be more aligned with COVID-19 pathogenesis, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication in the CNS remains widely discussed. Herein, we dissect this last issue, highlighting some evidence on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, as well as discussing gaps that should be addressed for a better understanding of its potential neurotropism, specifically in the CNS. Finally, we propose some deeper reflections on the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic potential.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological issues, including cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19, is also a risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation in COVID-19 patients, and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD. SARS-CoV-2 also induces cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We hypothesized that eNOS deficiency would worsen neuroinflammation, senescence, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and hypercoagulability in eNOS-deficient mice. Six-month-old eNOS+/− (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and wild-type (WT) male mice were infected with mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2. Mice were evaluated for weight loss, viral load, and markers of inflammation and senescence 3 days post-infection. eNOS+/− mice showed more weight loss (~15%) compared to WT mice (~5%) and increased inflammatory markers (Ccl2, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, IL-1β, and IL-6) and senescence markers (p53 and p21). They also exhibited higher microglial activation (Iba1) and increased plasma coagulation and BBB permeability, despite comparable lung viral loads and absence of virus in the brain. This is the first experimental evidence demonstrating that eNOS deficiency exacerbates SARS-CoV-2-induced morbidity, neuroinflammation, and brain senescence, linking eNOS to COVID-19-related neuropathology.">

        <tr id="The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of numerous variants with enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. Despite widespread vaccination, infections persist, and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 reprograms host metabolism remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether virus-induced lipid remodeling is conserved across variants and whether changes in lipid abundance correlate with alterations in lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Using global untargeted lipidomics and quantitative proteomics, we analyzed A549-ACE2 cells infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants and compared them to cells infected with the ancestral WA1 strain. In parallel, we conducted quantitative proteomics to assess virus-induced changes in the host proteome. Our results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 drives a remarkably consistent pattern of metabolic rewiring at both the lipidomic and proteomic levels across all three variants. We mapped changes in the expression of host metabolic enzymes and compared these to corresponding shifts in lipid abundance. This integrative analysis identified key host proteins involved in virus-mediated lipid remodeling, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), and ORM1-like protein 2 (ORMDL2). Together, these findings highlight conserved metabolic dependencies of SARS-CoV-2 variants and underscore host lipid metabolism as a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.">

        <tr id="Objectives To evaluate the immune persistence and cross-immune response of elderly individuals after Omicron BA.5 infections. Method The neutralizing antibodies against WT, BA.5, XBB.1 and EG.5 strains were analyzed. The T/B-cell subsets’ responses were tested through intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Results The neutralizing antibodies titers against WT and BA.5 strain, remaining high level for at least 6 months, were higher than that of both XBB.1 and EG.5 variants. The neutralizing antibodies of WT, BA.5, XBB.1, and EG.5 strains in the elderly were slightly lower than those in middle-age. The memory B cells decreased rapidly in the elderly, and Tfh, Th17 cells of the elderly continued to increase for only 3 months, while Tfh and Th17 cells increased in the middle-aged for over 6 months. For the elderly, after peptide stimulation, unswitched/switched memory B cells decreased, while double negative B cells displayed higher proliferation. The proportions of both naïve and Temra cells in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells declined, whereas those of Tcm and Tem cells elevated. In the meantime, both CD69+ and CD38+ T cells decreased, but the frequencies of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed an increasing trend. The proportions of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ cells also increased in older people with long COVID symptoms at 3m post-infection. Conclusions Omicron BA.5 infection induced lower neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1 and EG.5 variant. The decrease of memory B cells, CD69+ and CD38+T cells, as well as the increase of PD-1+, CTLA-4+ of CD4+/CD8+T cells and double negative B cells, indicate that sustained immune responses against BA.5 infection may wane more rapidly in elderly populations.">

The cellular immune response is crucial against SARS-CoV-2, particularly with the emergence of new variants that evade antibody neutralization. This study focuses on the immune memory response in individuals who have been vaccinated with the Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV vaccine. Methods: A cross-sectional study evaluated lymphocyte subpopulations using flow cytometry in 52 vaccinated adults (30 females, 22 males) who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or diagnosed with COVID-19. Conducted from February to June 2023 during the Omicron variant’s circulation, this study assessed antigens—CD154 in CD4+ T cells, CD107 and CD314 in CD8+ T cells, CD314 in NK cells, and CD86 in CD19 B cells—after stimulation with viral peptides and an inactivated virus. Granzyme B and IFN-γ were quantified using ELISA. Results: The memory response, regardless of gender, age, or Body Mass Index (BMI), was mild but significant upon exposure to a viral antigen or inactivated virus.

        <tr id="COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), stands as one of the most severe pandemics the world has ever faced in recent times. SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of symptoms, varying from severe manifestations to mild cases and even asymptomatic carriers. This diversity stems from a multitude of factors, including genetic predisposition, viral variants, and immune status. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune system engages pattern recognition receptors, setting off a series of intricate signalling cascades. These cascades culminate in the activation of innate immune responses, including induction of type I and type III interferons. The emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose challenges to the innate immune system defense. Therefore, investigating the innate immune response is crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophoshate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, a critical innate immune mechanism, represents a promising target for intervention at multiple stages to reduce the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review explores innate immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other immune responses critical for SARS-CoV-2 defence. As part of the therapeutic approach, we extend our review to highlight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as emerging and effective therapeutics for controlling SARS-CoV-2 by targeting different stages of the innate immune system. A diverse range of mAbs has been explored to address specific targets within the innate immune pathways. A deep understanding of innate immunity and targeted monoclonal therapeutics will be instrumental in combating viruses and their variants, laying the foundation for enhanced treatment and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Significance Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) employs multiple strategies to evade human antiviral defenses, leading to potentially severe outcomes such as pneumonia and death. A detailed investigation of these evasion strategies should enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and guide future vaccine development. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15) and demonstrate that its endoribonuclease activity delays the activation of antiviral responses in human lung cells. SARS-CoV-2 variants lacking this activity exhibit impaired replication and cause milder disease in animals, highlighting nsp15 as a key virulence factor. These findings underscore the importance of nsp15’s endoribonuclease activity in both promoting virus replication and influencing disease severity.">

        <tr id="Neurological symptoms involving the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) are common complications of acute COVID-19 as well as post-COVID conditions. Most research into these neurological sequalae focuses on the CNS, disregarding the PNS. Guinea pigs were previously shown to be useful models of disease during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic. However, their suitability for studying SARS-CoV-2 has not been experimentally demonstrated. To assess the suitability of guinea pigs as models for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the PNS, and to determine routes of CNS invasion through the PNS, we intranasally infected wild-type Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020. We assessed PNS sensory neurons (trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia), autonomic neurons (superior cervical ganglia), brain regions (olfactory bulb, brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus), lungs, and blood for viral RNA (RT-qPCR), protein (immunostaining), and infectious virus (plaque assay) at three- and six-days post infection. We show that guinea pigs, which have previously been used as a model of SARS-CoV-1 pulmonary disease, are not susceptible to intranasal infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, and are not useful models in assessing neurological impacts of infection with SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the early pandemic.">

        <tr id="In the last 2 years, there has been an increasing concern that SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a marker of undiagnosed cancers. A potential connection between COVID-19/long COVID and malignant transformation/cancer progression was reported in a number of studies. It is, however, unclear if the virus itself can cause malignant transformation or if it has a potential to support malignant processes in human body. We analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs collected from individuals infected with Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and conducted in vitro studies using BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells. Here we report that Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein induce activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription complex in infected cells. This effect is achieved through conversion of cellular 2-oxoglutarate into 2-hydroxy-glutarate, which most likely blocks the activity of HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylation. As such, it leads to activation of HIF-1, which triggers production of transforming growth factor–β type 1 (TGF-β). TGF-β induces expression of immune checkpoint proteins, such as galectin-9, programmed death-ligand 1, and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme, which is involved in production of immunosuppressive amino acid called L-kynurenine. These immune checkpoint pathways were capable of suppressing both helper and cytotoxic activities of T lymphocytes and, as such, could potentially support malignant processes in infected tissues.">

        <tr id="Background Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by persistent inflammation of the colon. The specific cause of UC is still not fully understood, but this condition is believed to arise from a combination of environmental, genetic, microbial, and immune factors. This study aimed to explore the specific roles of macrophages and fibroblasts in UC pathogenesis, focusing on their interactions and contributions to disease progression. Methods We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze macrophages and fibroblasts in peripheral blood and colon biopsy samples from UC patients. Bulk RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and flow cytometry and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data were used for validation. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the correlation between cell abundance and disease severity. Results Macrophages and fibroblasts were identified as key communication hubs in UC; specifically, SPP1 + macrophages and CHI3L1 + fibroblasts were significantly enriched at the sites of inflammation. These cells are strongly correlated with disease severity and orchestrate inflammatory responses within the intestinal immune microenvironment, contributing to UC-associated colorectal cancer. Conclusions Our study identified SPP1 + macrophages and CHI3L1 + fibroblasts as key contributors to UC pathogenesis. These cells are enriched in inflammatory sites, are correlated with disease severity, and play a role in UC-associated colorectal cancer, providing new insights into UC mechanisms.

We identify a subset of EGR1+ CD14+ monocytes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This subset activates NF-kB signaling and differentiates into tissue-damaging macrophages, which accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, we identify a CD8+ T cell subset with type II interferon signature in the peripheral blood and the lung tissue of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD), suggesting that chemokine-driven migration of these cells contributes to ILD progression.

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) includes a uniquely regulated immune response that supports homeostasis, response to injury, and response to pathogens. Recent work has shown that virus-associated immune responses in the CNS may contribute to neuronal injury and long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive decline. However, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate acute infiltration of immune cells from vascular compartments into the CNS are not well defined. Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection. CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells exhibit a bystander, memory phenotype (CD49d+, Tbet+, NKG2D+, Eomes+), are cytotoxic, and are recruited independent of antigen specific responses. We show that infiltration of CD8+ bystander T-cells is supported by microglia and infiltrating macrophage expression of IL-15 and interferon expression in the CNS. These innate antiviral immune signals support activation of bystander CD8+ T-cells in the CNS that contribute to tissue injury independent of virus replication at early time points post-infection. These data support a mechanism by IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T-cells to enter the CNS and contribute to injury independent of antigen-specific stimulation. Importance Prior studies have shown that virus infections in the respiratory and olfactory nerve pathways can result in long term injury in the brain. However, the mechanisms that link virus infection in the olfactory neurons and brain injury are not understood. We show that virus infection of olfactory neurons results in immune stimulation in the brain of resident immune cells to release a cytokine called IL-15 and interferon. This results in infiltration and activation of non-specific T-cells that cause injury of neurons in the brain. This may be an important mechanism by which respiratory viruses and other viruses cause inflammation and injury in the brain.">

        <tr id="Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 (NEK2), a member of the serine-threonine kinase family, is critically involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Upregulation of NEK2 is associated with aberrant B cell proliferation, a phenomenon potentially driven by NEK2-mediated disruption of the PKM1/PKM2 equilibrium. The overexpression of NEK2 in the B cell lineage may facilitate the maturation processes of B cells. Nonetheless, the precise role of NEK2 in modulating B cell-mediated immunity in autoimmune disorders remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that NEK2 was significantly upregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Pharmacological inhibition of NEK2 resulted in a marked reduction in the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on B cells, concomitant with a suppression of their proliferation and differentiation into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and class-switched memory B cells (SWM). Administration of the NEK2 inhibitor INH1 in a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) led to notable improvements in neurological function, amelioration of demyelination, and a decrease in the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the central nervous system (CNS) compared to vehicle-treated EAE mice. Mass cytometry analysis revealed that NEK2 inhibition downregulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and diminished the proportion of Th1 cells in the CD4 + T cell population. In vitro studies further substantiated that NEK2 blockade attenuated CD4 + T cell proliferation and differentiation into Th1 cells by disrupting B-T cell interactions. Collectively, these findings underscore an immunomodulatory function for NEK2 and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

        <tr id="Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating symptom in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Fresh insights indicate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may undergo neuron-like differentiation, potentially contributing to pain mechanisms. By examining the apolipoprotein E (APOE) together with the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), this study aims to clarify their joint function in modulating differentiation and how this interplay might be implicated in chronic pain associated with NPC. Through comprehensive analysis using TCGA-NPC transcriptomic datasets and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we assessed the molecular landscapes of both NPC-affected and healthy nasopharyngeal tissues. Differential gene expression and immune cell profiling identified macrophages as key players in the inflammatory response. Single-cell sequencing revealed a distinct subpopulation of neuron-like macrophages expressing neurogenesis-related genes. Macrophage-to-neuron-like cell transformation in response to NPC cells was examined through in vitro co-culture systems, highlighting the involvement of the APOE-TREM2 regulatory pathway. In vivo studies involved macrophage depletion and TREM2 knockdown in mouse models to evaluate the impact on chronic pain development. Infiltrating macrophages were significantly more abundant in NPC samples, with many exhibiting neuron-like features that were positively linked to high levels of WNT5 A expression. In vitro, NPC cells induced macrophage differentiation into neuron-like cells, a process regulated by TREM2 and APOE. TREM2 knockdown in macrophages resulted in a reduction of chronic pain behaviors in mouse models, highlighting the contribution of the APOE-TREM2 Axis to NPC-associated chronic pain. Our findings demonstrate that NPC cells promote macrophage reprogramming through the APOE-TREM2 Axis, leading to neuron-like differentiation and contributing to chronic pain in NPC patients. Targeting this pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies for managing chronic pain in NPC. Graphical Abstract 1.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe lung damage due to uncontrolled viral replication or/and excessive inflammation. New variants of concern (VOCs) have raised additional concerns due to disparate pathogenicity and possible enhanced virulence. Herein, using RNA sequencing, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis following infection with major VOCs. We evaluated the transcriptional changes induced in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice following infection with the ancestral B.1 lineage (Wuhan), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10). Our work reveals the molecular basis of pathological hallmarks in the lungs associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report that infection with B.1, pre-Omicron VOCs, and MA10 induce similar molecular fingerprints of excessive lung inflammation and immune activation in K18-hACE2 mice. Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed both shared and variant-specific responses, with key immune markers such as Cxcl10, Zbp1, Ifit3, Isg15, Rsad2, and Irf7 consistently upregulated across variants. Clustering of highly variable genes across samples revealed two variant groups distinguished by upregulation of antigen presentation and immune-related genes (e.g. Retnla, Saa3, Plac8, Ly6c2, H2-D1, and H2-K1). Delta, Beta, Alpha, and MA10 showed elevated expression, whereas Wuhan and Omicron exhibited attenuated responses. In addition, we show that Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) plays a role in viral clearance in the lungs after SARS-CoV-2 infection. ZBP1 deficiency resulted in reduced expression of cell death-associated markers and virus-induced cell death in the lungs following MA10 infection. Furthermore, the knockout of ZBP1 resulted in an attenuated inflammatory response with reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and decreased macrophage infiltration in the lungs. These results suggest that ZBP1 plays a role in viral clearance and in enhancing the inflammatory response and virus-induced cell death during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altogether, our study provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, facilitating the identification of biomarkers and the development of potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Introduction The immune and inflammatory responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in the context of long COVID, remain critical areas of study. Understanding these responses is essential for addressing the long-term health impacts of COVID-19. Recent research also highlights the pivotal role of proteases in modulating immune responses and contributing to disease severity, making them a key focus of our analysis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 72 convalescent COVID-19 patients, assessing recovery at three key time points: immediately post-discharge, one month later, and three months post-infection. Additionally, a subset of 15 patients was followed up two years post-COVID-19. Clinical parameters, including demographics, comorbidities, treatment modalities, and COVID-19 severity, were evaluated. Using CyTOF technology, we characterized over 30 immune cell subsets, including granulocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. We also performed multiplexed analyses of blood samples to profile cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and COVID-19-related proteins. Results Our comprehensive approach revealed significant changes in the immune system over time, highlighting the role of specific immune cells and proteases in the recovery process. Key findings include a decreasing deregulatory effect on immune responses exerted by subsequent SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Delta, and Omicron. Conclusion This study provides an in-depth understanding of the molecular dynamics of immune recovery following COVID-19. By integrating clinical profiling, plasma multiplex analysis, antibody profiling, mass cytometry immunophenotyping, in vitro PBMC stimulation, and the role of proteases, we offer valuable insights into the complex interplay of immune, inflammatory, and protease-mediated responses in individuals recovering from COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection precedes multiple sclerosis (MS) onset and plays a poorly understood etiologic role. To investigate possible viral pathogenesis, we analyzed single-cell expression in peripheral B cells from people with early MS collected longitudinally during the Immune Tolerance Network STAyCIS Trial. Expression profiles were compared with single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) from in vitro EBV models, autoimmune disorders, chronic infectious diseases, and healthy controls. Analyses focused on CD19+CD20+CD21loCD11c+T-bet+ atypical B cells (ABCs). ABCs were significantly enriched in early MS PBMCs versus healthy controls by scRNA-Seq and flow cytometry, establishing ABC expansion as a clinical feature. EBV-associated ABC expression, including CXCR3, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and PD-L2, was enriched in early MS; however, direct EBV infection of ABCs was not detected. Early MS ABCs exhibited significantly upregulated inflammatory cytokine mRNAs (CXCL8, IL18, VEGFA). Further, de novo EBV-infected B cells secreted IL-8 and VEGF. MS activity stratification revealed rare, distinctive inflammatory ABCs significantly underrepresented in individuals with no evidence of activity long-term versus people with additional relapsing-remitting MS activity at the primary endpoint. Moreover, CXCR3+ ABCs increased after baseline diagnosis and were significantly enriched in people with disease exacerbation during the study. Thus, ABC expansion and inflammatory responses correlate to early MS activity, possibly as a bystander response to EBV.">

        <tr id="Impaired spermatogenesis has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on male fertility remains unclear. The purpose of this multicenter study was to investigate the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility and determine the potential reasons leading to impaired male reproductive functions. In silico approach identified ~60 amino acid sequences containing at least five continuous residues shared by SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and spermatogenesis-linked proteins. Four synthetic peptides were tested with sera from independent cohorts of patients with acute and long COVID-19 syndrome (LCS), and naïve vaccinated subjects. Immunogenicity and pathogenicity studies were performed by immunizing mice with two selected peptides and testing the antigenicity of induced antibodies. While none of four peptides were recognized by antibodies from vaccinated people, infected patients exhibited high reactivity to peptide 4, and LCS patients, especially women, showed elevated antibody levels against peptide 2. Women with LCS and chronic fatigue syndrome had higher levels of peptide 2–reacting antibodies than those with idiopathic chronic fatigue syndrome. Noteworthy, peptide 2 antibodies showed, in in vitro experiment, a specific interaction with mouse testicular tissue antigens. These findings raise the possibility that cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and spermatogenesis-related antigens may affect infected patients’ fertility, suggesting a potential for autoimmune responses with human consequences.">

        <tr id="For a more precise understanding of the course of the pathological process in patients with severe COVID-19, it is necessary to continue the search for factors that affect the course of the pathological process and the possibility of a favorable outcome in critically ill patients. Comparative RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) in patients with a severe clinical course of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta strain revealed a number of differentially expressed genes that distinguish patients with different clinical outcomes (survivors vs. nonsurvivors) in the period of 30 days after admission to the hospital. Most of them are associated with the “negative regulation of viral process” and “negative regulation of immune response” clusters. Moreover, in surviving patients, there is increased expression of the key genes C1QB, C1QA, ISG15, SERPING1, VSIG4, KLRD1, TRPM4, and HFE incorporated in these clusters. Among these key genes, the ISG15 gene, which links several clusters of gene ontology enrichments and encodes an interferon-induced ubiquitin-like protein, deserves special attention. Its product, ISG15, is known to be a primary substrate for SARS-CoV-2 protease PLpro, which plays a role in counteracting hosts’ antiviral mechanisms.

        <tr id="Objectives: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are at high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019. It is unclear whether anti-viral cellular and humoral immunity is impacted in patients with ILD in the presence of immune disorders and immunosuppressive therapy. This results in poor control of viral infections following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to highlight the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We compared viral clearance, antibody levels, and T-cell immune response between healthy controls and patients with connective tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Results: Patients with ILD exhibited a higher viral load than the control group (1.58 × 106 vs. 2.37 × 103 copies/mL, p = 0.018), as well as a significantly lower level of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type (WT) virus (7.01 vs. 625.6, p < 0.0001) and Omicron BA.5 (7.19 vs. 128.4, p < 0.001). Similarly, a lower virus-specific T-cell (VST) immune response was observed 14 days post-symptom onset in the ILD group (CD4+ VSTs: 0.018 vs. 0.082, p = 0.005; CD8+ VSTs: 0.0008 vs. 0.047, p = 0.004). The ILD group had no other heightened inflammatory biomarkers compared with the control group. Conclusions: Our study provides novel evidence of the underlying interaction between virus clearance and host immune status and sheds light on the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly burdened global public health. However, the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 within the human body remains not fully understood. In this review, we overview the literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection across various human organs and tissues. We summarize the relevant specimen types, techniques for examining SARS-CoV-2 tropism, and findings at both organ/tissue and cellular levels. To systematically evaluate the evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism, we establish a hierarchical classification system based on two key criteria: (1) specimen origin and (2) detection methodology. Clinical specimens obtained directly from COVID-19 patients provide the most definitive evidence, whereas organoid-derived specimens and animal models indicate potential infectivity under artificial conditions. In terms of detection methods, we prioritize viral particle identification over viral protein or RNA detection, as the latter requires further confirmation to establish productive infection. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 potentially targets multiple human organ systems, including the respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, pancreas, small intestine, liver, and salivary glands. By contrast, viral tropism for the central nervous system and the reproductive system remains uncertain and requires further validation. At the cellular level, we identify specific target cell types vulnerable to infection, including ciliated epithelial cells, alveolar type II pneumocytes, enterocytes, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, and pancreatic acinar cells. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor distribution patterns and viral tropism, as well as potential variations in tissue specificity among different viral variants. We expect this review to provide a comprehensive landscape of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and enhance our understanding of the life cycle and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the human body.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease linked with deregulated immune responses, leading to hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis, often with fatal outcomes. Neutrophils play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, with elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts correlating with disease severity. Despite extensive research, the molecular processes associated with neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 remain elusive. Methods To investigate the molecular signatures underlying neutrophil-driven pathology, we conducted transcriptome analysis in neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients versus healthy individuals. To evaluate the specificity of identified neutrophil signatures in COVID-19, we extended our transcriptomic analysis to neutrophils from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a non-infectious fibrotic lung disease. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining was performed on lung biopsy specimens from IPF patients to validate transcriptomic findings at the tissue level. Results Our analysis revealed significant transcriptional changes in COVID-19 neutrophils, particularly in pathways involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and antiviral responses. Additionally, pathways associated with autophagy and chromatin remodeling were upregulated, while translation-related processes were suppressed, indicating an increased predisposition for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release. This neutrophil transcriptional signature in COVID-19 appears to be associated with the previously reported deregulation of the Activin/Follistatin system in the periphery. Notably, a comparative transcriptomic analysis with neutrophils isolated from IPF patients revealed the induction of substantially overlapping inflammatory processes, suggesting common deregulated responses in COVID-19 and IPF. Consistently, significant NET formation, a hallmark of COVID-19-related inflammation, was observed within lung biopsies from IPF patients. Conclusion By delineating both shared and disease-specific molecular pathways, our findings validate the critical role of neutrophils in COVID-19 and IPF pathophysiology, highlighting their involvement in balancing the inflammatory response across diverse lung diseases.

        <tr id="Most genetic variants that confer risk of complex immune-mediated diseases (IMD) affect gene regulation in specific cell types. Their target genes and focus cell types are often unknown, partially because some effects are hidden in untested cell states. B cells play important roles in IMDs, including autoimmune, allergic, infectious, and cancerous diseases. However, despite this established importance, B cell activation states are underrepresented in functional genomics studies. In this study, we obtained B cells from 26 healthy female donors. We stimulated B cells in vitro with six activation conditions targeting key pathways: the B cell receptor (BCR), Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR9, CD40, and a cocktail that promotes differentiation into double negative 2 (DN2) IgD- CD27- CD11c+ CD21- B cells, a likely pathogenic B cell subset for autoimmunity that is also expanded in infectious diseases. We profiled up to 24 human B cell activation states and up to 5 control conditions using RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq coupled with surface protein markers (CITE-seq), and ATAC-seq. We provide an in-depth characterization of how IMD-associated genes responded to stimuli and group into modules with distinct functions. Using high-depth RNA-seq data, we found pervasive splicing effects during B cell activation. Using single-cell data, we describe stimulus-dependent B cell fates. Chromatin data reveal the transcription factors likely involved in stimulus-dependent B cell activation. These open chromatin regions capture a significant proportion of the genetic risk of IMDs and elucidate IMD genetic risk variants with previously unknown function. These data are shared via an interactive browser that can be used to query the dynamics of gene regulation and B cell differentiation during activation by different stimuli, enhancing further investigation of B cells and their role in IMDs.">

        <tr id="Many neurological diseases remain difficult to treat, necessitating further elucidation of their pathogenesis. Conditional inactivation of Pdgfra in Nestin-expressing cells leads to the depletion of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha+ (PDGFRα+) oligodendroglial lineage cells responsible for myelination, resulting in forebrain hypomyelination and severe, progressive neurological deficits in neonatal mice. The present study examined the cerebral cortex of these mice to better understand the mechanisms underlying such progressive neurological deficits, that are often observed in refractory neurological diseases. Histological and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses showed that, following activation of meningeal border-associated macrophages (BAMs), PDGFRα+ fibroblasts that escaped gene inactivation were extensively recruited from the meninges into the hypomyelinated subpial cerebral cortex. Transcriptional reprogramming suggested that these fibroblasts originated from the pial fibroblast lineage and adopted a myofibroblast-like transcriptional phenotype. The recruited fibroblasts established stable cell–cell interactions with activated brain macrophages, including BAMs and microglia, accompanied by signaling pathways associated with chronic, tissue-damaging inflammation. Subsequently, inflammatory cortical lesions emerged, characterized by glial activation, angiogenesis, and neuronal oxidative stress. Treatment with a PDGFRα-neutralizing antibody significantly reduced fibroblast recruitment and mitigated glial activation and angiogenesis. These findings suggest that meningeal BAMs and pial fibroblasts are key contributors to the formation of tissue-damaging subpial cortical lesions. The interactions between brain macrophages and pial fibroblasts may contribute to the mechanisms underlying chronic and progressive neurological deficits and represent potential therapeutic targets for refractory neurological diseases.

Methods We analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and anxiety.

Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol. Results We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent. Conclusions Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.">

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis (VMC), a multifaceted pathological condition predominantly triggered by viral infections, has emerged as a major worldwide healthcare concern due to its intricate pathogenesis and substantial disease burden. Although the centrality of immune dysregulation in driving VMC progression is well-established, the precise identities of distinct immune cell subsets and their molecular mediators governing pathological progression continue to present significant knowledge gaps. Single-cell datasets were integrated using quality control, batch correction, and normalization. The FindAllMarkers function identified marker genes for each cluster. Cell types were annotated based on literature-derived marker genes. DESeq2 was employed to identify differentially expressed genes in T cells. CellChat was used to explore intercellular communication and identify key ligand-receptor signaling pathways. Receiver operating characteristic curves assessed the predictive performance of key factors in a validation cohort. T cells were re-annotated for higher-resolution subtyping, and pseudotime analysis depicted the cell trajectories of T cell subtypes. Integrated single-cell data revealed a comprehensive single-cell atlas of VMC. Mechanistic delineation of T cell as principal pathogenic effectors emerged through multi-omics interrogation incorporating single-cell transcriptomic profiling and pathological trajectory reconstruction; functional genomics analyses further substantiated their cardinal involvement in cardiotropic viral pathogenesis. Additionally, communication analysis highlighted CCL as a critical immune regulatory pathway for T cell interactions in VMC. Significant upregulation of CCL3 was confirmed in the validation cohort, establishing it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for VMC. Pseudotime analysis and re-annotation of T cell subpopulations revealed significant enrichment of T.8EFF.OT1LISO and T.Tregs in VMC. This study identifies T cells as key immune players in VMC, with CCL3 proposed as a novel biomarker for the condition.">

        <tr id="Background Immune-related myocarditis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is a rare immune-related adverse event (irAE) but is characterized by a high mortality rate. However, the specific pathological mechanisms underlying immune-related myocarditis remain largely unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the inflammatory microenvironment within cardiac tissues affected by immune-related myocarditis at the single-cell level to identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on an endomyocardial biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma who developed immune-related myocarditis following treatment with ICIs. Additionally, the scRNA-seq data of heart specimens from deceased donors without cardiovascular diseases were collected and applied as normal control. To validate our findings and assess their specificity to ICI-related pathology, we analyzed mouse scRNA-seq data, including controls, ICI-related myocarditis, viral myocarditis, and autoimmune myocarditis. Results We found elevated proportions of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and fibroblasts in the irAE group, suggesting an intensified inflammatory microenvironment in human immune-related myocarditis. Within the lymphocyte compartment, increased proportions of CD8 + T exhausted cells and CD8 + T proliferative cells were observed in the irAE group. The upregulated differentially expressed genes in myeloid cells in the irAE group were enriched in pro-inflammatory pathways, consistent with the observed metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. CXCL9 + fibroblasts, characterized by the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and enriched in the JAK-STAT and TNFα signaling pathways, were predominantly found in the irAE group. Venous endothelial cells specifically expressing atypical chemokine receptor-1 (ACKR1) interacted with myeloid cells and CXCL9 + fibroblasts through the CXCL signaling pathway, facilitating chemokine transcytosis and leukocyte recruitment. Analysis of murine scRNA-seq data further supported these findings, revealing that exhausted CD8 + T cells and pro-inflammatory fibroblasts were uniquely enriched in ICI-related myocarditis, reflecting its distinct inflammatory microenvironment. Conclusions We elucidated the unique inflammatory microenvironment of immune-related myocarditis at the single-cell level. Our work revealed key cell subpopulations that were significantly implicated in inflammation, thus offering potential therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which led to a global pandemic causing millions of deaths, is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- -2). While previous research on COVID-19 has primarily utilized nasal swabs and blood samples, these do not provide comprehensive insights into all the organ systems affected by the infection. A recent study by Topper et al. addressed this gap by analyzing both nasal samples and autopsy tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Their findings highlight a significant role of mitochondrial damage pathways and RAAS overactivation in contributing to the severity of SARSCoV- 2 infections. Importantly, targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and RAAS overactivation pathways may offer promising and specific druggable targets for treating COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Background By employing a high-dimensionality approach, this study aims to identify mechanistically relevant cellular immune signatures that predict poor outcomes. Methods This prospective study recruited 39 children with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit and 19 healthy age-matched children. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were studied with mass cytometry. Unique cell subsets were identified in the paediatric sepsis immunome and depicted with t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (tSNE) plots. Network analysis was performed to quantify interactions between immune subsets. Enriched immune subsets were included in a model for distinguishing sepsis and validated by flow cytometry in an independent cohort. Results The median (interquartile range) age and paediatric sequential organ failure assessment (pSOFA) score in this cohort was 5.6(2.0, 11.3) years and 6.6 (IQR: 2.5, 10.1), respectively. High-dimensionality analyses of the immunome in sepsis revealed a loss of coordinated communication between immune subsets, particularly a loss of regulatory/inhibitory interaction between cell types, fewer interactions between cell subsets, and fewer negatively correlated edges than controls. Four independent immune subsets (CD45RA−CX3CR1+CTLA4+CD4+ T cells, CD45RA−17A+CD4+ T cells CD15+CD14+ monocytes, and Ki67+ B cells) were increased in sepsis and provide a predictive model for diagnosis with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC 0.90 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.82–0.98) in the discovery cohort and AUC 0.94 (95% CI 0.83–1.00) in the validation cohort. Conclusion The sepsis immunome is deranged with loss of regulatory/inhibitory interactions. Four immune subsets increased in sepsis could be used in a model for diagnosis and prediction of poor outcomes.">

Methods We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of physiological and pathological parameters in Balb/c mice infected with H1N1 influenza over a 14-day period. We employed the DIABLO multi-omics integration method to analyze dynamic changes in the lung transcriptome, metabolome, and serum metabolome from mild to severe stages of infection. Results Our analysis highlighted the critical importance of intervention within the first 6 days post-infection to prevent severe disease. We identified several novel biomarkers associated with disease progression, including Ccl8, Pdcd1, Gzmk, kynurenine, L-glutamine, and adipoyl-carnitine. Additionally, we developed a serum-based influenza disease progression scoring system. Discussion This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying influenza progression and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The developed scoring system serves as a valuable tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of severe influenza.">

        <tr id="Recurrent COVID-19, defined as two or more distinct episodes, may reflect an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In this case–control study, we compared three groups: individuals with recurrent COVID-19, those with a single episode, and SARS-CoV-2-naïve controls. We genotyped six immune-related SNPs, including TLR7 rs179008, and measured CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens using flow cytometry. The T allele of TLR7 rs179008, previously linked to reduced receptor expression, was significantly overrepresented in the recurrent COVID-19 cohort. At baseline, frequencies of IFN-γ+, IL-2+, and TNF-α+ cells among CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not differ between groups. However, stratification by the rs179008 genotype revealed that T allele carriers displayed diminished IFN-γ production in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and reduced IL-2 production in CD4+ T cells. Following vaccination, T cell responses were comparable across all genotypes. The T allele of TLR7 rs179008 is associated with recurrent COVID-19 and may contribute to impaired T cell-mediated immunity. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanistic role of TLR7 variation in SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lung cancers develop from lung epithelial cells after a series of genetic and epigenetic changes, and these cells are major sites of influenza virus infection. Thus, we explored how changes found in patient-derived lung cancer cell lines impacted influenza virus replication and identified two lines with opposite responses to influenza A viral infection. We show that the NCI-H820 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is resistant to influenza A virus and VSV infection, while LUAD line NCI-H322 is highly susceptible to infection by both viruses. H322 cells have a homozygous deletion in a region of chromosome 9 encoding IFNαgenes, IFNβ1, IFNω1, and IFNε genes, leading to downregulation of immune response and high infection rates. In contrast, the resistant H820 cell line has three copies of these same interferon genes and shows increased expression of interferon-regulated genes. We found that the resistance of H820 cells to influenza infection is likely linked to impaired viral entry—due to high basal levels of interferon-induced proteins known to inhibit endocytosis (IFITM1/2/3, NCOA7, and CH25H)—and to increased expression of mRNAs that encode other antiviral factors. In contrast, H322 cells show the absence or low levels of interferon-regulated genes involved in the inhibition of viral entry. These results suggest that the opposite phenotypes on viral entry of H322 and H820 cells may be at least in part associated with impaired or enhanced interferon response, respectively. Since most lung cancer patients have genomic characterization of their tumors, individualized differences in interferon responses may have therapeutic and patient management implications. IMPORTANCE Lung cancers develop from genetic and epigenetic changes that can dramatically influence patients’ susceptibility to viral infection and replication. This study evaluates the responses to influenza virus infection of two patient-derived lung cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the cell lines investigated are of the same cancer type, lung adenocarcinomas, yet one cell line is highly susceptible, while the other cell line is highly resistant to viral infection. This is in part due to contrasting genetic alterations that lead to changes in the interferon response pathways, which differentially impact viral entry. Thus, identifying these risk factors can inform the prognosis of patients infected with influenza virus and guide their personalized treatment plans.

Then, Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate the causal relationship between COVID-19 and RA, and further analyzed the cytokines and immune cells in COVID-19 and RA. Finally, we obtained microarray datasets of COVID-19, RA patients, and normal controls from the GEO database. And performed functional, pathway enrichment, and immune cell infiltration analysis on differentially expressed genes between each group. Results The meta-analysis results suggested that the hospitalization rate and mortality rate of RA patients infected with COVID-19 were higher than those of the control population. MR analysis showed a positive correlation between COVID-19 infection and RA. We also found that interleukin 13 was associated with RA and COVID-19 infection. CD27 on IgD + CD24 + B cells and CD3 on CD39 + CD8 + T cells are common immune cell phenotypes in two diseases. In addition, COVID-19 function is enriched in immune responses mediated by leukocytes and neutrophils, while RA is significantly enriched in the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. The results of immune cell infiltration showed that both diseases had more neutrophils and fewer CD8 T cells. Conclusion There are many similarities between COVID-19 and RA in immune inflammatory responses such as cytokines and immune cells. COVID-19 may lead to the development of RA through immune inflammation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40659-025-00620-7.">

        <tr id="As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, the extent of their impact on shaping population immunity through repeated waves remains poorly understood. This study assessed age-specific immune responses and the effects of vaccination on neutralization against wild-type (WT) and JN.1 variants. We analyzed 4,371 serum samples from individuals aged 6 months–80 years (May-August 2024). We found that 95.1% of participants had detectable anti-N Ig, suggesting widespread prior infection. Among unvaccinated children (6 months–4 years), 96.5% exhibited anti-RBD or anti-N Ig antibodies mostly from asymptomatic infections. Neutralization against JN.1 did not significantly differ by age, but children aged 6 months–4 years exhibited higher JN.1 neutralization than WT, while individuals aged ≥ 12 years showed the opposite pattern. Unvaccinated individuals demonstrated stronger neutralization against JN.1, whereas vaccinated participants had lower neutralization against JN.1 relative to WT, regardless of vaccine dose. No significant differences in JN.1 neutralization were observed across vaccine doses or age groups. Although 86.5% of participants exhibited neutralizing activity against JN.1, the titers remained relatively low. These findings highlight that almost all children experienced asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that natural exposure maintains immunity in adults. Infection-driven boosting may improve community-wide protection and alleviate immune imprinting, offering key insights for optimizing vaccine strategies.

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Long Covid is a post‐viral syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms targeting multiple organ systems after initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Current literature suggests that the mechanisms causing Long Covid involve viral persistence, immune dysregulation, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. By forming reservoirs in the tissues of various organs, SARS‐CoV‐2 may evade immunological clearances while triggering immune responses and contributing to chronic symptoms through cytokine imbalances, T‐cell exhaustion, and systemic inflammation. These symptoms parallel other post‐viral syndromes such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting similar mechanisms of pathology. The coronavirus has also been linked to neuroinflammation and endothelial dysfunction causing cognitive symptoms and cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, its ability to lower energy production links it to post‐exertion malaise (PEM) and muscle pain. These symptoms may result from iron dysregulation and persistent oxidative stress due to Covid‐impaired mitochondrial function. This review synthesizes current data on the mechanisms that drive Long Covid pathogenesis and explores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate viral persistence, immune dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. It is critical to understand these interactions to develop targeted interventions that address the long‐term sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in millions of deaths globally. Adults with immunosuppression (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients) and those undergoing active cancer treatments experience worse infections and more severe COVID-19. It is difficult to conduct clinical studies in these populations, resulting in a restricted amount of data that can be used to relate mechanisms of immune dysfunction to COVID-19 outcomes in these vulnerable groups. To study immune dynamics after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to investigate drivers of COVID-19 severity in individuals with cancer and immunosuppression, we adapted our mathematical model of the immune response during COVID-19 and generated virtual patient cohorts of cancer and immunosuppressed patients. The cohorts of plausible patients recapitulated available longitudinal clinical data collected from patients in Montréal, Canada area hospitals. Our model predicted that both cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients with severe COVID-19 had decreased CD8 + T cells, elevated interleukin-6 concentrations, and delayed type I interferon peaks compared to those with mild COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, our results suggest that cancer patients experience higher viral loads (however, with no direct relation with severity), likely because of decreased initial neutrophil counts (i.e., neutropenia), a frequent toxic side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, severe cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients suffered a high degree of tissue damage associated with elevated neutrophils. Lastly, parameter values associated with monocyte recruitment by infected cells were found to be elevated in severe cancer and immunosuppressed patients with respect to the COVID-19 reference group. Together, our study highlights that dysfunctions in type I interferon and CD8 + T cells are key drivers of immune dysregulation in COVID-19, particularly in cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals.">

        <tr id="Leishmania is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease prevalent in 97 countries. Co-infection with HIV increases susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis (VL), accelerating HIV’s progression to AIDS. Managing VL in HIV-infected individuals is challenging due to atypical presentations and limited therapeutic responses, highlighting the need to develop new disease management strategies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great promise for this goal as they can be used for a higher understanding of biological processes and biomarker discovery. In this context, a proteomic analysis was carried out from plasma-EVs of an HIV/VL patient over two years and compared to HIV and healthy controls. The analysis confirmed classical EV markers but showed limited detection of Leishmania proteins. However, variations in human protein abundance related to relevant immunological processes were observed. Notably, the macrophage receptor with a collagenous structure (MARCO) was consistently detected only in the patient and not in the control groups. Significantly, the relevance of MARCO as a possible VL biomarker was confirmed using a validation cohort with five VL patients and its detection by Western Blot was possible. Although MARCO warrants further investigation as a VL related biomarker, the study of EVs confirmed their promise of being a privileged window into this disease. Future studies are needed to broaden data on EVs in infections to improve clinical management.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused a global public health crisis, with a significant impact on multiple body systems. This virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, shows ~80% genomic similarity to SARS-CoV and ~50% genomic similarity to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The spike (S) protein plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the virus, as it facilitates its entry into host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In addition to the respiratory system damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a variety of gastrointestinal (GI), neurological, cardiovascular (CV), ocular, renal, etc. clinical manifestations. Neurological complications, such as anosmia, ague, headache, encephalitis and cerebrovascular events, were frequently observed, being attributed to both direct viral invasion and a very strong systemic inflammatory response. GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common and may occur independently of respiratory symptoms, and the presence of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) detected in fecal samples suggests possible fecal-oral transmission. The CV system is affected by myocardial damage, inflammation and coagulation disorders, with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. At the ocular level, the virus was identified in ocular secretions, and conjunctivitis, uveitis and episcleritis were observed in about 11% of patients. Renal involvement, manifested by acute kidney injury, was detected in 0.5-7% of cases. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to respiratory tract involvement but also has significant systemic implications.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world, but our understanding of causation is still lacking. A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD. Methods This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation. Results Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Discussion Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.">

        <tr id="Abstract Arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV), Ross River (RRV), and O’nyong nyong virus (ONNV), are emerging and reemerging viruses that cause disease characterized by fever, rash, and incapacitating muscle and joint pain and inflammation. Alphavirus infection induces robust immune responses, leading to the upregulation of several cytokines and chemokines, including chemokine C ligand 4 (CCL4). CCL4 is a chemoattractant for immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, recruiting these cells to the site of infection, stimulating the release of proinflammatory mediators, and inducing T cell differentiation. CCL4 has been found at high levels in both the acute and chronic phases of chikungunya disease; however, the role of CCL4 in arthritogenic alphavirus disease development remains unexplored. Here, we tested the effect of CCL4 on MAYV infection in mice through antibody neutralization and treatment with recombinant mouse CCL4. We observed no differences in mice depleted of CCL4 or treated with recombinant CCL4 in terms of disease progression such as weight loss and footpad swelling or the development of viremia. CCL4 uses the G protein-coupled receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). To determine whether CCR5 deficiency would alter disease outcomes or virus replication in mice, we inoculated CCR5 knockout (CCR5−−) mice with MAYV and observed no effect on disease development and immune cell profile of blood and footpads between CCR5−/− and wild type mice. These studies failed to identify a clear role for CCL4 or its receptor CCR5 in MAYV infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tamdy virus (TAMV) is one of the zoonotic tick-borne bunyaviruses that have emerged as global public health threats in recent decades. To date, however, TAMV pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have established different mouse infection models to enable investigation of TAMV pathogenesis. Adult BALB/c mice did not exhibit obvious clinical symptoms or signs post-TAMV infection. In contrast, adult type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR−/−) A129 mice were found to be susceptible to high-doses of TAMV (6 × 102 and 6 × 104 FFU) and all developed severe clinical symptoms and signs, including weight loss and immobility, and reached the euthanasia criteria at 4/5-day post-infection (dpi). Viral RNA was detected in peripheral blood and different tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, and brain) of the high-dose infected adult A129 mice, with the highest viral loads in the liver (approximately 108.3 copies/μL). Pathological examination also revealed severe liver damage in the high-dose infected A129 mice. In addition, the titres of TAMV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies increased rapidly 4–5 dpi. Analysis of cytokine and chemokine expression changes demonstrated that type I IFN may play an important role in the host defence against viral infection by enhancing IL-10 production. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses showed that liver injury may be associated with virus-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Together, we have investigated TAMV pathogenesis using immunocompetent and immunocompromised mouse models, which will facilitate the development of TAMV-specific antivirals and vaccines.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and systemic immune responses, particularly through the gut–lung axis. Disruptions in gut microbial diversity and function—commonly referred to as dysbiosis—have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we assessed the gut bacteriome and permeability in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using 16S sequencing and ELISA assays, respectively. We also measured blood inflammatory cytokines and fecal secretory IgA to evaluate systemic and mucosal immune responses. Significant alterations in both alpha and beta diversity metrics were observed in patients with COVID-19 (n = 79) and those with post-COVID-19 condition (n = 141) compared to the controls (n = 97). Differential abundance and taxonomic analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles in the infected groups. Increased plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and zonulin were detected in patient samples. Some genera were elevated during acute infection, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia-Shigella were associated with increased zonulin levels, indicating compromised intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that gut dysbiosis may contribute to bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the gut–lung axis and suggest that modulating the gut microbiota could support immune regulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Understanding the intricacies of the host inflammatory response to coronaviruses is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to mitigate the severe consequences of these infections. Various coronaviruses can trigger the host immune response, leading to highly similar inflammatory reactions. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which belongs to the same group of beta-coronaviruses as SARS-CoV-2 and induces high pathogenicity in mice, typically serves as a safety model for investigating highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, replication, and virus-host interactions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) infected with MHV. Results We characterized the global gene changes at both the mRNA and protein levels following viral infection, identifying ten genes involved in various anti-MHV biological processes. Furthermore, by integrating our findings with relevant published data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells, we observed significant similarities in the responses to MHV and SARS-CoV-2, particularly regarding immune and inflammatory responses. Discussion These findings underscore how our research enhances the understanding of global gene expression alterations during coronavirus infection and facilitates the identification of novel antiviral targets.">

        <tr id="Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) represent one of the most susceptible populations for developing severe COVID-19, and a unique human genetic condition for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility of neurologically vulnerable individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human Chromosome-21 (HSA21) triplication in DS causes global transcriptional deregulation, affecting multiple genes that may directly (e.g., TMPRSS2) or indirectly influence the SARS-CoV-2 entry into central nervous system (CNS) cells. The anti-viral immune response may also be altered in cells with trisomy-21 (T21) due to triplication of genes encoding for several interferon receptor subunits and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we demonstrate that human cells derived from fetal cortical specimens and maintained in primary cultures are susceptible to infection with a molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to express the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and to authentic SARS-CoV-2. The level of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cultures originated from different cortical specimens varied, seemingly depending on ploidy and chromosomal sex of the cells. We confirmed the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cultures and found that XY T21 group had the highest TMPRSS2 mRNA levels, which was associated with increased infectivity in XY—compared to XX T21 cultures. The XX T21 cultures exhibited elevated expression of several ISGs (MX1, STAT1, and STAT2) which was associated with lower infectivity. The comparisons of postmortem aged brain specimens revealed reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2, but elevated STAT2 protein levels in individuals with DS and Alzheimer’s disease (DS-AD) compared to control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) group. Collectively, these results suggest multifactorial regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cortical cells that involves ploidy, chromosomal sex, and the expression of genes implicated in regulation of virus entry and anti-viral response as contributing factors.

        <tr id="Background Vitiligo is an acquired skin depigmentation disorder often accompanied by leukoderma and leukotrichia. Half of vitiligo patients experience episodes of stress. Methods We established a chronic unpredictable mild stimulation (CUMS) model in C57BL/6 J mice to simulate chronic mental stress-induced leukoderma and leukotrichia. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to determine the immune landscape and to characterize the relationship between immune-stromal cells. Immunohistochemistry was employed for validation. Results We discovered a similar pro-inflammatory micro-environment composed of keratinocytes and fibroblasts similar to that in human vitiligo. Macrophages in CUMS mice expressed high levels of inflammatory factors and were inclined to an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. Two distinct clusters of melanocytes were also identified: Mel2, defined as melanocyte stem cells, and Mel3, defined as mature melanocytes. Mel2 cells were prone to pyroptosis and necroptosis, while Mel3 cells were susceptible to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. Compared with control mice, higher expression of CXCL16 on dendritic cells and of the CXCL16 ligand, CXCR6, on γδT cells were observed in leukoderma. Dendritic cells and natural killer T cells in the CUMS mouse spleen exhibited elevated levels of CXCL16 and CXCR6, respectively. Activation of the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis and a non-specific immune response in our CUMS model might imitate chronic mental stress-induced vitiligo in humans better than CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated models. Conclusions We discovered two melanocyte clusters with distinct fates and a pro-inflammatory micro-environment with CXCL16–CXCR6 axis activation of antigen-presenting cells and other innate immunocytes that might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of stress-induced vitiligo.

        <tr id="Background Persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 is an increasing problem after COVID-19 disease. The pathogenesis of this persistent post Covid-19 Condition (PCC) is, however, largely unknown. We hypothesized that persistent T cell activation and exhaustion play a role in PCC development. Methods We examined plasma levels of soluble (s) CD25, TIM-3 and LAG-3, all markers of T cell activation/exhaustion, by enzyme immunoassays in 170 home-isolated and 53 hospitalized patients for up to 18 months after COVID-19 in relation to persistent symptomatology. Results Our major findings were: (i) Cases with persistent dyspnea and fatigue had markedly higher sCD25 at 6–18 months with a more modest increase in sTIM-3. (ii) Cases with memory problems at 12–18 months had increased sLAG-3 iii) sCD25 correlated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and microneutralization titers only in cases with PCC while sTIM-3 correlated with these parameters irrespectively of symptoms. iv) Although hospitalized patients had markedly elevated levels of T cell activation/exhausting markers during follow-up, there was no relation to PCC symptoms. Conclusion Our study indicates a role for T cell activation/exhaustion in PCC following home isolated COVID-19 infection, with somewhat different patterns of sCD25, sTIM-3 and sLAG-3, but not in hospitalized COVID-19 patients where disease severity may be more important.">

        <tr id="Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) has been extensively used in clinical treatments during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades host cells via its spike (S) protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell membrane, mediating viral-host membrane fusion. Blocking viral entry is a crucial step in preventing infection, with the interaction between the S receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 being a key antiviral target. Given that SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects the respiratory system and approximately 25% of patients suffering from corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with gastrointestinal symptoms, we are committed to identifying more active ingredients in QFPDD that target the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of COVID-19 patients. Among medicinal plants, ephedra and liquorice derived from QFPDD, along with two other Chinese herbs, Platycodon grandiflorum and Radix Rhei Et Rhizome (rhubarb), have garnered our interest. These herbs have historically been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating infectious diseases with respiratory and digestive symptoms. Here, we established a library containing all components of the four individual herbs gathered from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and performed structure-based virtual screening to identify potential ACE2/S-RBD inhibitors. Subsequently, we selected 10 ingredients from the top 30 candidates and evaluated their activities using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Delphinidin and deapio platycodin D (DPD) showed significant antiviral potential with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 45.35 µM and 1.38 µM, respectively. Furthermore, delphinidin also inhibited the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), indicating its dual-viral target inhibitory potential. Notably, DPD effectively suppressed HCoV-229E replication in BEL-7402 cells. This study not only provides a strategy for rapid identifying antiviral agents from TCM in anticipation of future pandemics but also offers theoretical and experimental evidence to support for the clinical use of QFPDD.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and often exhibit reduced vaccine efficacy due to chronic immunosuppression. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, understanding immune responses following natural infection remains critical for informing protection strategies in this vulnerable population. We conducted a longitudinal study of SOT recipients who had recovered from Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 infection, evaluating immune responses to the JN.1 subvariant at 4-6 weeks and 1 year postinfection.


METHODS
Neutralizing antibodies to JN.1 were measured using a pseudovirus neutralization assay, and JN.1-specific T-cell responses were assessed by flow cytometry. Frequencies of bulk T-cells and innate immune cells, identified via flow cytometry, and their correlation with adaptive responses were also analyzed.


RESULTS
At 4-6 weeks, 30% of participants had detectable JN.1-neutralizing antibodies, rising to 43% at one year, although titers remained low. In contrast, CD4⁺ T-cell responses were robust and detected in 75%-83% of participants at 4-6 weeks, increasing to 75%-93% by 1 year. CD8⁺ T-cell responses were observed less frequently. Exploratory correlations between innate and bulk T-cell subsets with heterologous adaptive immune responses were investigated but did not reveal statistically significant relationships.


CONCLUSION
These findings offer important insights into the durability and breadth of immunity following natural infection in immunocompromised transplant recipients. While heterologous neutralizing antibodies were limited, sustained CD4+ T-cell responses may help mitigate severe disease following exposure to JN.1-derived variants, which continue to dominate the SARS-CoV-2 landscape.">

        <tr id="Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with new-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The overall goal of this study is to uncover how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD to inform the identification of at-risk patients and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Transcriptomics analysis of 43 PD pathogenic genes was conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID-19 patients with varying severity including 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU, and 17 ICU patients, compared to 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The study shows that COVID-19 severity gradient differentially dysregulates PD pathological genes. Dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients was identified as the convergent network of COVID-19—PD interactions. These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system in ICU COVID-19 patients. A potential synergistic co-expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes was observed in ICU patients, indicating a possible overlap in biological pathways. Dysregulation of the PD pathopharmacogene, SLC6A3 was observed in ICU patients, suggesting potential COVID-19-gene-drug interactions. Nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes, which could advance studies on PD, including diagnosis, pathogenesis, and the development of disease-modifying treatments. Outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients may face a higher risk of developing new-onset PD, whereas ICU COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19-gene-drug interactions.

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a complex, multifactorial condition characterized by persistent symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks following acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, but chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and viral persistence are increasingly being implicated. This study investigated the immunopathological drivers of long COVID-19 and their associations with clinical manifestations and organ damage. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 200 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-65 years, in which immune markers, autoantibody profiles, lymphocyte dysfunction, and imaging findings were assessed over a 12-month period. Persistent inflammation was observed, with elevated interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α ± levels correlated with lung fibrosis and cognitive impairment. Autoantibodies were detected in 40% of the participants, particularly those with cardiovascular and neurological symptoms. A significant reduction in CD8+ T-cell counts was associated with severe fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, whereas persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in 10% of cases, primarily in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms. Imaging studies revealed multiorgan involvement, with structural abnormalities in the lungs, heart, and brain. These findings highlight the interplay of immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity in long-term COVID-19, underscoring the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to address its long-term health impacts.">

        <tr id="A series of hyper immune responses as combined reaction of innate and adaptive immunity may lead to cytokine storm prolonging sickness and causing severities among patients of respiratory infection in general and attack COVID-19 patients in particular. We measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines viz. TNF-alpha, Interleukin-6 and Interferon-gamma. The initiation of immune system against viral infection involves role of cytokines. In Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, high levels of cytokine were observed which led to severity in immune-compromised patients, elderly and even mildly infected patients. High levels of cytokines have not only been observed in SARS-CoV-2 but are also prevalent in other human coronavirus infections. There are other respiratory diseases occurring in the form of epidemics and outbreaks in all parts of the world, yet understanding of the fact that when system gets infected by more than one respiratory virus, the cytokine expression observed has not been looked upon.

This is irrespective of the fact that antibodies may already be present against respiratory diseases within the system over the course of time. We hereby hypothesise that if cytokine storm due to such condition may lead to activation of Th1/Th2 response, develop severity/complications and ultimately may lead to lung damage. In this study, we measured the cytokine response profiles (TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 and IFN-gamma) in patients with respiratory viral infections and we observed that TNF-α is the main factor contributing to cytokine storm and that hyper innate immune response is brought by mucosal immunity during infection by SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Although COVID-19 was originally considered a respiratory illness, it is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have far-reaching impacts on the nervous system. Neurological symptoms such as chemosensory dysfunction are frequently observed during acute infection and approximately 10% of COVID-19 cases will go on to develop new or persistent long-term symptoms, a condition known in the literature as post-acute symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC) or by the patient-coined term Long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The emergence of Long COVID has prompted renewed interest in the study of post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), particularly in the area of neuroimmune interactions. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the current body of literature on neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Long COVID, with an emphasis on neuroimmune mechanisms drawn largely from autopsy studies and animal models. A more complete understanding of neuroimmune crosstalk in Long COVID will not only guide the development of therapies for this highly disabling condition but will also contribute to our general understanding of neuroimmune interactions in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Several years after the COVID‐19 pandemic, the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immunity and the potential protective role of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination through trained immunity remain a subject of investigation. This study aimed to determine the long‐term impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immune cells and the association between BCG vaccination, latent infections and COVID‐19 severity and sepsis progression. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of patients who recovered from mild/severe/critical COVID‐19 (n = 97, 3–17 months after COVID‐19) and sepsis patients (n = 64). First, we assessed the impact of COVID‐19 and its severity on immune cell frequencies and expression of functional markers. Further, we analysed plasma titres of anti‐Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies and their association with COVID‐19 severity and sepsis outcome. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID‐19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS‐CoV‐2 and LPS. Results Post‐COVID‐19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterised by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post‐critical COVID‐19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. A trend toward improved outcomes in BCG‐seropositive COVID‐19/sepsis patients was observed, although this may be confounded by age differences between groups. In contrast, the monocyte response to stimulation appeared unaffected by COVID‐19 severity. Conclusion These findings highlight the long‐term alterations of immune cells in post‐COVID‐19 patients, emphasising the substantial impact of COVID‐19 on immune function.">

        <tr id="Background: In just twenty years, three dangerous human coronaviruses—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have exposed critical gaps in early detection of emerging viral threats. Current diagnostics remain pathogen-focused, often missing the earliest phase of infection. A virus-agnostic, host-based diagnostic capable of detecting responses to viral intrusion is urgently needed. Methods: We hypothesized that the lungs act as biomechanical instruments, with infection altering tissue tension, wave propagation, and flow dynamics in ways detectable through subaudible vibroacoustic signals. In a matched case–control study, we enrolled 19 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls across two Johns Hopkins hospitals. Multimodal data were collected, including passive vibroacoustic auscultation, lung ultrasound, peak expiratory flow, and laboratory markers. Machine learning models were trained to identify host-response biosignatures from anterior chest recordings. Results: 19 COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls (mean BMI 32.4 kg/m2, mean age 48.6 years) were successfully enrolled to the study. The top-performing, unoptimized, vibroacoustic-only model achieved an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.67–0.92). The host-covariate optimized model achieved an AUC of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.94–1.0), with 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 82–100%) and 99.6% specificity (95% CI: 85–100%). Vibroacoustic data from the anterior chest alone reliably distinguished COVID-19 cases from controls. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that passive, noninvasive vibroacoustic biosignatures can detect host response to viral infection in a hospitalized population and supports further testing of this modality in broader populations. These findings support the development of scalable, host-based diagnostics to enable early, agnostic detection of future pandemic threats (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04556149).">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been linked to long-term neurological effects with multifaceted complications of neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have found that pathological changes in transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) are involved in these cases. This review explores the causal interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and TDP-43 from multiple perspectives. Some viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to induce pathological changes in TDP-43 through its cleavage, aggregation, and mislocalization. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause liquid−liquid phase separation and stress granule formation, which accelerate the condensation of TDP-43, resulting in host RNA metabolism disruption. TDP-43 has been proposed to interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, though its role in viral replication remains to be fully elucidated. This interaction potentially facilitates viral replication, while viral-induced oxidative stress and protease activity accelerate TDP-43 pathology. Evidence from both clinical and experimental studies indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to long-term neurological sequelae, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like and frontotemporal dementia-like features, as well as increased phosphorylated TDP-43 deposition in the central nervous system. Biomarker studies further support the link between TDP-43 dysregulation and neurological complications of long-term effects of COVID-19 (long COVID). In this review, we presented a novel integrative framework of TDP-43 pathology, bridging a gap between SARS-CoV-2 infection and mechanisms of neurodegeneration. These findings underscore the need for further research to clarify the TDP-43-related neurodegeneration underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and to develop therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating long-term neurological effects in patients with long COVID.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the profound and lasting impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system. Beyond acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent, disrupting immune homeostasis and contributing to persistent inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, neuropathy, and mood disturbances. These are linked to immune dysregulation involving cytokine imbalance, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, glial activation, and T-cell exhaustion. Key biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NFL) correlate with disease severity and chronicity. This narrative review examines the immunopathological mechanisms underpinning the neurological sequelae of long COVID, focusing on neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and molecular mimicry. We also assess the role of viral variants in shaping neuroimmune outcomes and explore emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including biomarker-guided and immune-targeted interventions. By delineating how SARS-CoV-2 reshapes neuroimmune interactions, this review aims to support the development of precision-based diagnostics and targeted therapies for long COVID-related neurological dysfunction. Emerging approaches include immune-modulatory agents (e.g., anti-IL-6), neuroprotective drugs, and strategies for repurposing antiviral or anti-inflammatory compounds in neuro-COVID. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities, personalized therapies guided by biomarkers and patient-specific immune profiles may be essential. Advancements in vaccine technologies and targeted biologics may also hold promise for prevention and disease modification. Finally, continued interdisciplinary research is needed to clarify the complex virus–immune–brain axis in long COVID and inform effective clinical management.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 776 million confirmed cases and more than 7 million deaths worldwide. In addition to humans, various animal species have exhibited natural infections, with mink being the only farmed animals consistently linked to severe illness and zoonotic transmission to humans. This study investigates histological pulmonary lesions in Danish farm mink infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), focusing on groups with different clinical signs and outcomes. Results Histopathological evaluations revealed lesions in SARS-CoV-2-positive mink with and without clinical signs of disease. The main findings in lungs from SARS-CoV-2-positive mink in all study groups were extensive respiratory epithelial damage, acute diffuse alveolar damage, and vascular lesions, including the formation of thrombi. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of viral particles primarily in the respiratory epithelia. Lymphoid cells exhibited nodular and perivascular aggregates similar to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in older SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected mink, indicating a potential age-related feature of mink lungs. Conclusions The presence of subclinical and long-term pulmonary lesions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in farm mink suggests that the impact of outbreaks may be more serious than clinical signs records indicate. The current SARS-CoV-2 surveillance system on Danish mink farms does not properly address such problems and repeated outbreaks on farms could occur without detection if there are no clinical signs or increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2. The severity of subclinical lesions reveals hidden health and welfare challenges in mink, underscoring the need for improved prevention measures, surveillance and understanding of long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mink.

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a systemic host response to infection with life-threatening consequence which ranks among the top ten causes of death worldwide. Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular and cellular impact of sepsis remains rudimentary. Methods A mouse sepsis model was established through LPS induction and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect T helper 1 (Th1) cell subsets and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in septic mice. Additionally, in vivo neutralization experiments were conducted to block IFN-γ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, to explore the regulatory effect of DOCK2 on septic mice. Finally, the regulatory mechanism of DOCK2 was analyzed using an in vivo RNA-seq system. Results We identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a critical downregulating factor for LPS signal pathways. DOCK2-deficient mice were highly sensitive to LPS-induced sepsis and E. coli sepsis with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-γ which were mainly due to hyperresponsive Th1 cells. Ulteriorly, we verified the vital role of DOCK2-mediated Th1 cells in sepsis by neutralizing both IFN-γ and CD4 and found both of which blockade reduced the severity of sepsis in Dock2−/− mice. Mechanically, DOCK2-mediated cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling act in concert to govern peripheral Th1 cell fate. Conclusion Our data indicates that DOCK2 acts as a protective role in regulating systemic inflammation and multi-organ injury in bacterial sepsis by constraining Th1 response. These findings provide new targets for immunomodulatory therapy of sepsis, suggesting that targeting the DOCK2-Th1 axis may become a new strategy to improve systemic inflammatory responses associated with bacterial infections.">

        <tr id="Current vaccines rely on the sequence of Spike (S) protein to induce immunity against the severe acute respiratory coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus. Because of the high mutation rate of the viral S protein, new mutant strains are developed to generate new infectivity profiles. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are synthesized on demand to sustain homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to determine the action of selected LMs in the viral replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 variant in human lung and nasal epithelial cells. Cells from healthy donors were infected with Omicron BA.5 for one hour and treated with 500 nM Elovanoid (ELV)‐N32, ELV‐N34, Resolvin D6 isomer (RvD6i), Neuroprotection D1 (NPD1), or vehicle before and after infection. Impedance was recorded to determine cell death by infectivity. Cells were then immunostained for nucleocapsid (N) protein, microtubule‐associated protein 1B‐light chain 3 (LC3B), and autophagic proteins. N and S RNA were measured to assess the synthesis of viral components. The addition of ELV‐N34 or RvD6i decreased the synthesis of N RNA by 76.7% and 96.9%, respectively, in lung primary culture, while NPD1 exerted the same effect in nasal epithelial cells (61.7% reduction). In lung cells, transcription of autophagy‐related gene‐3 (ATG3) and Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), components of the autophagy initiation process, decreased compared to the non‐treated infected cells. The results suggest that specific LMs prevent viral autophagy machinery hijacking, leading to a decrease in BA.5 replication. This novel effect of the bioactive LMs as antivirals, regardless of the protein sequence, would potentially complement vaccination and other prevention and treatment therapeutics.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to a wide-range of outcomes from mild or asymptomatic illness to serious complications and death. While many studies have characterized hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patient immune responses, we were interested in whether serious complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be predicted early in ambulatory subjects. To that end, we used samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals from the placebo arm of the BLAZE-1 clinical trial who progressed to hospitalization or death compared to individuals in the same study who did not require medical intervention and investigated whether baseline serum cytokines and chemokines could predict severe outcome. High-risk demographic factors at baseline, including age, nasal pharyngeal viral load, duration from symptom onset, and BMI provide significant predictive capacity for a hospitalization or death with an AUC of ROC = 0.77. The predictive performance of our outcome modeling increased when baseline serum protein markers were included. In fact, the one-marker model indicated that there were 51 individual proteins (including known markers of inflammation like IL-6, MCP-3, CXCL10, IL-1Ra, and PTX3) that significantly increased the AUC of ROC beyond high-risk patient demographics alone to range between 0.78 to 0.88. Moreover, a two-marker model incorporating levels of both IL-6 and PTX3 further improved the prediction over the addition of a single protein marker to an AUC of ROC = 0.91. While the analytes identified in this study have been well-documented to be altered in SARS-CoV-2 infection, this analysis demonstrates the potential value of their use in predicting hospitalization or death in ambulatory participants infected with SARS-CoV-2 and could guide early treatment decisions.">

        <tr id="Bibliographic Review: Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19) presents a clinical spectrum from oligosymptomatic to severe and multisystemic inflammation, which may be followed by death. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has as its main human receptor the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is also crucial in the control of the inflammatory response, through the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System ( RAAS). Objective:  Due to the controversial roles of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the aim of this literature review was to address its distribution in the human body, associating it with the severity of COVID-19. Thus, using the terms ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus, a search was performed on the SciELO, PubMed and Scopus platforms. The research revealed that the aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 is related to its ability to interact with the host and, consequently, with ACE2 - widely distributed in organs and tissues. Final Considerations: However, since COVID-19 is an inflammatory disease, and ACE2 is critical in controlling inflammation, especially in RAAS, the data compiled in this review infers that ACE2 is more likely to act as a protective factor, against the severity of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to persistent or newly emerging symptoms lasting for months, a condition known as long COVID (LC). The pathophysiology of LC remains poorly understood, with cytokine dysregulation proposed as a key mechanism, although findings across the studies have been inconsistent. Patients and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study using the Olink® Target 96 Inflammation Panel to assess cytokines in COVID-19 (COV) patients at three months and six months post-infection. These profiles were compared with those of individuals recovering from other upper respiratory tract infections (non-COV). Additionally, we analyzed differences between individuals with LC and those who recovered from COVID-19. Predictive models for LC at three months and sixth months post-infection were developed using inflammatory markers and relevant clinical cofactors, including gender, age, BMI, hemogram, Β2-microglobulin, D-dimers, LDH, AST, ALT, Ferritin, vitamin D, CRP, and the severity of acute COVID-19 infection as classified by WHO criteria. Results: We observed a general decline in inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients over time, with only a few cytokines elevated (CCL4 at month 3 and CST5 at month 6) compared to non-COV controls. In LC patients, an early phase of low-grade inflammation transitioned into significant reduction in proinflammatory biomarkers compared to recovered individuals. Rather than indicating immune normalization, this pattern suggests a possible suppression or exhaustion of the immune response in the months following acute infection. Importantly, our predictive modeling demonstrated that this specific cytokine signature, in combination with acute disease severity and clinical cofactors, described well the presence of LC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inflammation-related biomarker dysregulation following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection evolves dynamically over a six-month period. By the sixth month, compared to the third month, the presence of LC is more accurately predicted by a combination of persistent biomarker alteration and the severity of the initial infection, as defined by WHO criteria. This represents a novel insight, as previous studies have primarily associated LC with elevated proinflammatory markers, whereas our results suggest that immune suppression or exhaustion may play a more prominent role in the later stages.">

        <tr id="Background COVID-19 progression and recovery involve complex gene expression changes and immune dysregulation, but their dynamic alterations remain poorly understood. Current clinical indicators lack precision in distinguishing severe cases, highlighting the need for molecular biomarkers and diagnostic tools. Methods Three transcriptomic datasets were analyzed: 1) COVID-19 progression from Healthy, Moderate, Severe, to ICU patients; 2) recovery stages (1, 3, and 6 months) compared to Healthy controls; and 3) COVID-19 ICU versus non-ICU patients. Differential expression analysis, immune cell infiltration estimation, machine learning (LASSO regression and random forest), and functional enrichment were used to identify key genes and molecular mechanisms. Results Gene expression analysis revealed dynamic changes during COVID-19 progression. Adaptive immune cells (e.g., B cells and T cells) decreased, while innate immune cells (e.g., monocytes and neutrophils) increased, particularly in ICU patients. Recovery analysis showed significantly reduced adaptive immune cells at 1 month, with partial recovery by 3 and 6 months. Machine learning identified CCR5, CYSLTR1, and KLRG1 as diagnostic biomarkers for distinguishing ICU from non-ICU patients, with AUC values of 0.916, 0.885, and 0.899, respectively. Conclusion This study identified CCR5, CYSLTR1, and KLRG1 as efficient diagnostic biomarkers for severe COVID-19 using machine learning and revealed immune regulatory features across COVID-19 progression and recovery.">

        <tr id="Background: Patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may exhibit altered immune responses to infections such as SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to characterize the cytokine profiles associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify immune markers related to the persistence of the humoral response in pwMS. Methods: A total of 90 pwMS were recruited before the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination in Spain; 46 were seropositive—defined by the presence of IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2—and 44 were seronegative. We compared baseline cytokine levels between groups and followed seropositive individuals for six months to assess IgG antibody persistence. Results: Seropositive patients showed significantly lower baseline levels of IL-10, IL-23, and IFN-α compared to seronegative individuals. Notably, elevated IL-18 at baseline was associated with persistent IgG seropositivity at six months. Conclusions: These findings suggest a distinct cytokine profile in SARS-CoV-2–exposed pwMS and highlight IL-18 as a potential marker of sustained humoral response. This study provides insight into host-virus immune dynamics in MS patients and may help guide future strategies for infection monitoring and immune evaluation in this population.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lipid metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of acute viral infections by affecting viral replication and the host immune response. In contrast, the role of host lipid metabolism during chronic viral infection has been less explored. The current study aims to define the role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a primary physiologic receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), during natural gammaherpesvirus infection. Gammaherpesviruses are highly prevalent cancer-associated pathogens that induce and manipulate germinal center responses to establish life-long infection of B cells. Importantly, gammaherpesvirus-infected germinal center B cells are thought to be the target of viral transformation. In this study, we found that global SR-BI deficiency led to increased gammaherpesvirus lytic gene expression in the lungs during the acute stage of infection. Chronic gammaherpesvirus infection of the SR-BI-deficient host was associated with exaggerated germinal center responses and increased differentiation of self-reactive B cells that persisted during the long-term stage of chronic infection. Interestingly, SR-BI-deficient germinal center B cells, although more numerous, failed to support efficient gammaherpesvirus infection. The exaggerated germinal center response was also observed following immunization of the SR-BI-deficient host, unveiling the novel role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of physiological and gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center responses. IMPORTANCE Lipid metabolism affects diverse acute viral infections. In contrast, less is known about the effect of lipid metabolism on chronic virus infection, including in the context of an intact host. Host lipid homeostasis is maintained via a combination of endogenous lipid synthesis that takes place in most cell types and cellular interaction with exogenous, circulating lipids. This study focuses on defining the interaction between SR-BI, a primary HDL receptor, and natural gammaherpesvirus infection. We found that SR-BI deficiency led to increased expression of lytic gammaherpesvirus genes during acute gammaherpesvirus replication in the lungs. Importantly, chronic gammaherpesvirus infection unveiled the physiological role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of the germinal center response, a B cell differentiation process that is critical for physiological B cell responses and that is manipulated by gammaherpesviruses to establish chronic infection.

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) strains mutate rapidly, making it crucial to study their molecular mechanisms for swift vaccine and drug development. Here, we utilized host lung proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling to investigate the underlying pathology caused by the variants. Lung tissues infected with wild‐type GD108, Delta, or Omicron BA.1 variants showed overexpression of proteins and phosphoproteins linked to the innate immune pathway, particularly in the Omicron group, with high activation of NOD‐receptor and RIG‐I like receptor signaling pathways. Protein‐protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed six key proteins, including antiviral innate immune response receptor RIG‐I (DDX58), and five interferon‐related proteins (IFIT2, ISG15, MX1, STAT1, and EIF2AK2), highlighting the importance of the innate immune response in combating all three variants. Kinase prediction analysis suggested that six kinases (DAPK1, DAPK2, DAPK3, PRACK, TTK, and MAP2K2), potentially inhibited by Fostamatinib, were activated across all three variants, and might be potential drug targets, pending further verification. Omicron infection, compared to other mutants, significantly disrupted proteins related to pulmonary structural support, like integrin and collagens, and inhibited efferocytosis, reducing the host's ability to eliminate the pathogen. These findings suggest that innate immune activation and structural disruption may contribute to Omicron‐related pathology, potentially being useful for research into the molecular mechanisms underlying lung injury from SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.">

        <tr id="The evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its impact on public health continue to demand attention as the virus continues to evolve, demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt to diverse selective pressures including immune responses, therapeutic treatments, and prophylactic interventions. The SARS-CoV-2 variant landscape remains dynamic, with new subvariants continuously emerging, many harboring spike protein mutations linked to immune evasion. In this study, we characterized a panel of live SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those key subvariants implicated in recent waves of infection. Our findings revealed a significant variability in mutation patterns in the spike protein across the strains analyzed. Commercial antibodies and human convalescent plasma (HCoP) samples from unvaccinated donors were ineffective in neutralizing the most recent Omicron subvariants, particularly after the emergence of JN.1 subvariant. Using human airway epithelial cells derived from healthy bronchiolar tissue (hBAEC), we established both monoinfections and coinfections involving SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus H1N1 (IFAV_H1N1) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Assessments were conducted to compare viral infectivity and the production and release of immune mediators in the apical and basolateral compartments. Notably, Omicron KP.3.1.1 subvariant induced a more pronounced cytopathic effect in hBAEC compared to its parental strain JN.1 and even surpassed the impact observed with the ancestral wild-type virus (WA1/2020, Washington strain). Furthermore, the coinfection of KP.3.1.1 subvariant with IFAV_H1N1 or RSV did not attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity; instead, it significantly exacerbated the pathogenic synergy in the lung epithelium. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-β, and IL-10 were upregulated in hBAEC following SARS-CoV-2 monoinfection with recent Omicron subvariants as well as during coinfection with IFAV_H1N1 and RSV. Taken together, our findings offer new insights into the immune evasion strategies and pathogenic potential of evolving SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, as well as their interactions with other respiratory viruses, carrying important implications for therapeutic development and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="A liver involvement in Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) has been frequently observed in patients hospitalised for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection during 2020; in such cases, the clinical and prognostic relevance of hepatocellular damage has been widely acknowledged. On the other hand, there is less extensive evidence of liver injury (LI) in the subsequent waves of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of LI and to determine the clinical, biochemical, and immune‐virologic characteristics associated with its development in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients hospitalised in 2021–2022. This single‐centre retrospective study included 455 patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and respiratory failure. LI was defined by the detection of transaminase levels exceeding three times the upper limit of normality (ULN) and was further classified as early or late liver injury based on whether the peak transaminase value occurred within or after 7 days from hospital admission. LI was found in 17.6% (80/455) of the overall cohort, while early liver injury (ELI) and late liver injury (LLI) were detected in 10.4% and 11.5%, respectively. LI was associated with younger age, elevated inflammatory and tissue damage markers, with the presence of chronic liver disease (CLD), and with the use of interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) inhibitors. Patients with LI had a higher probability of severe COVID‐19, transfer to intensive care unit, and in‐hospital death than those without. In multivariable analysis, younger age, administration of IL‐6 inhibitors, and the presence of higher gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were independently related to the development of overall LI, whereas in‐hospital mortality was independently correlated with the occurrence of LLI. The occurrence of hepatocellular damage therefore has been associated with a pro‐inflammatory profile and with worse overall outcomes but not with increased likelihood of liver failure or liver‐related mortality.">

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global health crisis, with many patients experiencing not only acute neurological and sensory symptoms but also persistent sensory abnormalities, commonly referred to as long COVID sequelae. The mechanisms underlying somatosensory abnormalities induced by SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein in pain regulation. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 N protein exacerbates pathological pain in mouse models of bone cancer, chemotherapy, neuropathic, and inflammatory, and promotes the chronification of acute inflammatory pain. We also identify a potential interaction between the N protein and Nav1.7 in dorsal root ganglion neurons from mice, monkeys, and humans. Furthermore, the N protein significantly increases Nav1.7 currents in dorsal root ganglion neurons from both mice and monkeys by delaying Nav1.7 inactivation without altering its expression or membrane trafficking. This modulation of Nav1.7 function by the N protein not only intensifies pain hypersensitivity but also prolongs the duration of pain, potentially facilitating the transition from acute to chronic pain. Our findings underscore the importance of vigilant management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with pathological pain and suggest potential therapeutic targets for mitigating COVID-19-related pain.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has a diverse spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe and critical cases that result in the death of the patient. Alongside the viral factors host factors like Age, deregulation of the immune response and presence of comorbidity determine the patient’s outcome. Here we sought to assess the impact of age on natural antibody response, CBC-based inflammatory markers, and outcome of COVID-19 patients. We divided the participants into three groups, young (≤ 35 years), middle-aged (40–60 years), and old (≥ 65 years) patients and collected and analyzed sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. We found that elderly patients showed higher (P < 0.05) levels of inflammation like increased neutrophil percentages, NLR, lymphopenia, and low Hgb levels, compared to middle-aged and young patients. Interestingly these markers were also associated with mortality of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in ion concentration, lipid profile, and coagulation test between the three age groups. We also found that elderly patients showed significantly (P < 0.05) decreased levels of natural antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the two groups. Lastly, we assessed the effect of dexamethasone treatment, even if statistically not significant (P > 0.05) we observed a positive trend among patients under dexamethasone in the aspect of decreasing inflammatory markers. To conclude we showed that SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by an age-dependent deregulation of inflammatory markers that are associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients.

        <tr id="Life-threatening severe dengue (SD) develops in a small subset of patients suffering from dengue fever (DF), a febrile disease that develops following infection with dengue virus (DENV). DENV is a mosquito-borne positive -sense RNA virus. The rapid spread of DENV vectors, which was exacerbated by climate change and inadequate control measures, has led to outbreaks affecting millions worldwide. There is no specific treatment for DF, and the recently introduced vaccines are ineffective in containing the current outbreaks. Like many other viral diseases, the immune system plays a key role in dengue pathogenesis. The lack of models replicating the disease’s immunopathological features has hampered the understanding of the immune system’s role in developing this disease. Recent advances, such as single-cell approaches, provide better systems and methodologies to study the role of different immune cells in SD, closing this gap and providing a better mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis and promoting the identification of targets for therapeutic interventions. Here, we summarize recent advances in SD research, focusing on immune cell interactions and their role in disease severity.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cerebral cytokinopathies are key examples of dysregulated cytokine responses. While mouse models with targeted production of individual cytokines have been pivotal in establishing a causal link between cytokines and disease— especially in the central nervous system—they often fail to replicate the complex inflammatory environments seen in various neuropathological conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, where multiple cytokines are upregulated. Methods To address this, we developed a novel mouse model, GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice, by combining transgenic mice with astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 (GFAP-IL6 mice) and IFN-α (GFAP-IFNlo mice). Results Our findings reveal that chronic, low-level production of IFN-α, below the typical disease-inducing threshold, significantly accelerates disease progression in GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice compared to GFAP-IL6 mice. The double transgenic mice exhibited progressive ataxia, persistent seizure-like episodes, and reduced survival. Remarkably, the clinical and pathological symptoms remained predominantly IL-6-driven and required the presence of adaptive immune cells. Conclusion In summary, we demonstrate that subclinical levels of IFN-α can markedly exacerbate IL-6-mediated neurological disease, suggesting that future studies, should consider the combined effects of IL-6 and IFN-α.">

A new pathogenic and transmittable virus was discovered late in December, 2019 in the Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and named as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).With its high transmission rate virus spreads all over the world and caused “pandemic” situation. Research finding concluded that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats than to human with unknown intermediate source. After analyzing patients it was observe the symptoms of infection are fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness and it may progress to pneumonia, ARDS and multi-organ dysfunction. Pathogenesis of COVID-19 shows that it recognizes ACE2 receptors present in lungs, heart, kidney, liver etc. in humans. Diagnosis of infection can be done by RT-PCR, CT scan findings and other methods too. Scientists all over the globe are racing to find COVID-19 vaccine and its potential treatment. In this review we try to cover all aspects of COVID-19 and provide all its necessary details.">

        <tr id="Introduction Microvascular injury is central to the pathophysiology of sepsis, but its interaction with the immune system in early infection is unclear. This study aimed to phenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from emergency department (ED) patients with suspected bacterial infection and correlate the results with microvascular changes. Methods This prospective observational study included 49 adult ED patients with suspected infection and 17 healthy controls. Capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions were measured by sublingual microscopy, while peripheral blood immune cell subsets were analyzed by deep flow cytometry. Results Network visualization of 72 diIerentially regulated parameters revealed specific changes in diIerent immune cell subsets. Innate immune changes included a functional diversion of monocytes towards pathogen defense and tissue repair, whereas adaptive immune changes included the development of CD4+ T cells with Th2-profile and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct immune endotypes: E1 with a suppressed immune response and higher disease severity, and E2 with an enhanced immune response and lower disease severity. Patients showed significant reductions in capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions, which were neither correlated in magnitude nor associated with endotypes. There was a strong association between damaged glycocalyx and several monocyte and T-cell subsets. This association was not observed for capillary density. Discussion We demonstrate that glycocalyx damage is associated with a unique immunological signature, distinct from functional capillary density. These findings provide a strong basis for future studies of immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction in infection.">

        <tr id="Immune cell activation is a feature of COVID-19, that leads to cytokine storm which causes neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, related to psychiatric symptoms due to the depletion of neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate which play a major role in adult neurogenesis. ACE2 receptors are expressed in the hippocampus and decreased neurogenesis in this region is a major factor behind the neuropsychiatric disorders. SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain indirectly through neuroinflammation and altered neurochemical signaling and even mild COVID-19 infections can lead to sustained microglial activation, which disrupts neural networks and impairs cognitive function. The long COVID-19 may be associated with cognitive dysfunction in those who recovered and immunological response may affect synaptic pruning and reduced anterior cingulate cortex volume at one year after COVID-19. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or PASC, commonly known as Long COVID is a significant public health concern and "brain fog" is one of the most debilitating cognitive impairments, affecting memory, concentration, and executive function occurring in 88% of cases. Brain fog may be linked to persistent changes in neurotransmitter levels, particularly involving dopamine and serotonin which play an essential role in cognition, attention, and emotional regulation. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the chemokine CCL11, is linked to cognitive impairments in patients with persistent symptoms. Neuroprotective agents that support neuronal health, such as antioxidants and mitochondrial enhancers and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic and direct current enhance cortical excitability are investigated in cognitive recovery. Evaluation of the currently predominant VUM (a Variant Under Monitoring), LP.8.1, and the most recently designated NB.1.8.1, is increasing as 10.7% of global sequences reported recently due to minor mutations in spike protein. In May 2025, TAG-CO-VAC (Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine) advised that the monovalent vaccines targeting against JN.1 or KP.2 lineages are highly appropriate.">

        <tr id="The pathology of severe COVID-19 is due to a hyperinflammatory immune response persisting after viral clearance. To understand how the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is regulated to avoid severe COVID-19, we tested relevant immunoregulatory cytokines. TGF-β, IL-10 and IL-4 were neutralized upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (CMA3p20), a model of mild disease; and lung inflammation was quantified by histology and flow cytometry at early and late time points. Mild weight loss, and lung inflammation including consolidation and alveolar thickening were evident 3 days post-infection (dpi) and inflammation persisted to 7 dpi. Coinciding with early monocytic infiltrates, CCL2 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were transiently produced 3 dpi, while IL-12 and CCL5 persisted to 7 dpi, modeling viral and inflammatory phases of disease. Neutralization of TGF-β, but not IL-10 or IL-4, significantly increased lung inflammatory monocytes and elevated serum but not lung IL-6. Neutralization of IL-4 prolonged weight loss and increased early perivascular infiltration without changing viral titer. Anti-IL-4 reduced expression of Arg1, a gene associated with alternative activation of macrophages. Neutralizing TGF-β and IL-4 had differential effects on pathology after virus control. Lung perivascular infiltration was reduced 7 dpi by neutralization of IL-4 or TGF-β, and peri-airway inflammation was affected by anti-TGF-β, while alveolar infiltrates were not affected by either. Anti-IL-4 prolonged IL-12 to 7 dpi along with reduced IL-10 in lungs. Overall, the immunoregulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-4 dampen initial inflammation in this maSARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that promotion of immunoregulation could help patients in early stages of disease.

        <tr id="Rat post-mitotic septal neurons, engineered to reversibly proliferate and arrest under physiological conditions, can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine representative independent cDNA libraries were made to evaluate global arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses, e.g., upregulated interferon (β-IFN) RNA, that were previously identified in normal uninfected and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent (CJ) infected septal neurons. This reversible cell model encompassed a non-productive latent (CJ−) and a highly infectious (CJ + , 10 logs/gm) state. Arrest of normal uninfected neurons upregulated a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts and known neuronal differentiation transcripts (e.g., Neuregulin-1, GDF6 and Prnp). As expected, many activated IFN innate immune genes were simultaneously upregulated (e.g., OAS1, ISG20, CD80, cytokines, chemokines and complement) along with clusterin (CLU) that binds misfolded proteins. Arrest of latently infected CJ− cells induced even more profound global transcript differences. CJ+ cells markedly downregulated the anti-proliferative controls seen in arrested normal cells. CJ+ infection also suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ infection. In contrast, IFN and cytokine/chemokine pathways were strongly upregulated. Analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection enhances and expands anti-viral responses; 3) non-productive latent infection can epigenetically imprint many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. This rare cell model of latent infection is fundamental for interrogating triggers of late onset disease that are also relevant for Alzheimer’s Disease. Peripheral human blood and intestinal myeloid cells that are latently infected may also be conditionally stimulated in vitro to produce CJ+ linked diagnostic transcripts.">

        <tr id="Immune function declines with age, leading to increased vulnerability of the elderly to viral infectious pathogens. The mechanisms by which aging negatively impacts the innate and adaptive immune system, leading to enhanced susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens, remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we utilized a mouse model of infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a virus that can infect the lungs and lead to pneumonia, a rare but serious health concern in the elderly. Following intranasal inoculation of young (6 weeks), adult (36 weeks), and aged mice (68 weeks) with HSV-1 (KOS strain) we: (i) compared the local and systemic immune responses to infection in young, adult, and aged mice, and (ii) correlated the level and type of immune responses to protection against HSV-1 infection and disease. Compared to young and adult mice, aged mice displayed: (i) increased activation of epithelial cells with a decreased expression of TLR3; (ii) increased activation of dendritic cells with increased expression of MHC-I, MHC-II, and CD80/86; (iii) decreased production of type-I interferons; (iv) delayed production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs; and (v) impairment frequencies of functional HSV-specific CD107+IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells associated with the increased incidence of viral infection and disease.

        <tr id="CD16 is an activating Fc receptor on natural killer cells that mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a key mechanism in antiviral immunity. However, the role of NK cell-mediated ADCC in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, particularly whether it limits viral spread and disease severity or contributes to the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. We hypothesized that the high-affinity CD16AV176 polymorphism influences these outcomes. Using a novel in vitro reporter system, we demonstrated that CD16AV176 is a more potent and sensitive activator than the common CD16AF176 allele. To assess its clinical relevance, we analyzed 1,027 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC), a comprehensive longitudinal dataset with extensive transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data. The high-affinity CD16AV176 allele was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and severe disease trajectories. Lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers were correlated to CD16AV176; however, there was no difference in viral load across CD16 genotypes. Proteomic analysis revealed that participants homozygous for CD16AV176 had lower levels of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that CD16AV176 enhances early NK cell-mediated immune responses, limiting severe respiratory complications in COVID-19. This study identifies a protective genetic factor against severe COVID-19, informing future host-directed therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the diverse clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including neurological complications. This study investigates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiles to identify proteins associated with neuroinflammatory processes in COVID-19. CSF samples from 11 critically ill patients and 5 COVID-19-negative controls were analyzed using high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 203 proteins were identified, of which 76 exhibited differential expression peptides (DEPs). Proteins involved in coagulation (fibrinogen alpha and beta chains, prothrombin) and immune responses (complement cascade components, immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma, kappa, and lambda subunits) were significantly upregulated in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, proteins involved in antioxidant defense (e.g., superoxide dismutase) and neural maintenance (e.g., neural cell adhesion molecule 1, Neuronal cell adhesion molecule) were significantly downregulated. Functional annotation revealed enriched pathways associated with hemostasis, immune regulation, and neuroinflammatory responses. Protein–protein interaction analysis highlighted interactions among complement and coagulation cascade components, underscoring their roles in inflammation and potential thrombotic complications. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces significant alterations in the CSF proteome, reflecting neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress mechanisms. Identifying these proteins and their association with diverse pathophysiological mechanisms provides insights into the neurological impact of COVID-19 and may serve as therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications in post-COVID-19 neurological syndromes.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common non-infectious inflammatory CNS disease, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and focal demyelinated lesions. Traditionally considered an autoimmune disease, MS is driven by the immune system's attack on CNS myelin, resulting in cumulative disability. However, conventional anti-inflammatory treatments often fail to prevent progressive deterioration, particularly in the absence of overt inflammation, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis. Recent research has revealed a more complex disease mechanism involving both peripheral immune responses and intrinsic CNS factors, with glial cells playing a central role. Persistent inflammation in MS is associated with mixed active/inactive lesions dominated by microglia and astrocyte dysregulation. These glial populations exhibit maladaptive activation, contributing to failed remyelination and ongoing neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations as well as aging further exacerbate glial dysfunction, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation and damage. Emerging evidence suggests that the interplay between peripheral immune cells and glial populations and the potential dual-use nature of molecular tools shared by the immune system and CNS disrupts homeostatic signaling, leading to a loss of tissue integrity. This review synthesizes findings on glial cell biology in MS, with a focus on microglia and astrocytes, while addressing their roles in demyelination, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. The limitations of animal models, particularly EAE, in replicating the complexity of MS are also addressed. Finally, critical questions are outlined to guide future research into glial pathology and to identify novel therapeutic approaches targeting progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 presents with a distinct immunological profile, characterized by elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts, seen commonly in fungal and bacterial infections. This study demonstrates that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 show evidence of neutrophil degranulation and have increased expression of neutrophil surface lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), a marker of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). Both early LOX-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on neutrophils were associated with development of severe disease. To determine whether tissue damage or inflammation is required to induce PMN-MDSCs or whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly activates neutrophils to become PMN-MDSCs, we incubated healthy human neutrophils with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly induced LOX-1 surface expression in healthy neutrophils independent of productive infection. LOX-1 induction was dependent on granule exocytosis and promoted up-regulation of reactive oxygen species, CD63, and PD-L1, enabling LOX-1+ neutrophils to suppress autologous T cell proliferation in vitro. These results support a role for PMN-MDSCs in mediating severe COVID-19, and inhibition of PD-L1 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the release of interferons (IFNs) and the proinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases. STAT3, a key protein in this pathway, has been implicated in promoting inflammation, making its inhibition a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles (MSC-EVs), enriched with immunomodulatory and antiviral miRNAs, offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating gene expression and regulating inflammatory responses. This study investigates the ability of Lyophilized MSC-EVs to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, highlighting their potential application in COVID-19 management.


METHODS
Male Syrian hamsters were used as an experimental model, housed under controlled laboratory conditions. SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020) was propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titers were determined using plaque assays. Hamsters were intranasally challenged with the virus and treated intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of lyophilized human Wharton's jelly-derived MSC-extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Histopathological evaluations were performed on lung tissues using H&E, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining. Morphometric analyses were conducted to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Western blotting was employed to evaluate protein expression. All procedures adhered to ethical and biosafety guidelines.


RESULTS
The administration of MSC-EVs significantly upregulated the expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-124, miRNA-155, miRNA-29b, miRNA-7, miRNA-145 and miRNA-18a compared to their levels in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a targeted release of miRNA-cargo from the MSC-EVs into the lung tissue of the animals. MSC-EVs impaired the activation of the STAT3/STAT1 signaling pathway and reduced the cytokine storm and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that MSC-EVs have the potential to effectively mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs and their clinical application in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY The mechanisms by which viruses enter host cells are crucial for their ability to infect and cause disease, serving as major targets for both host immune responses and therapeutic strategies. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry process is primarily driven by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, in conjunction with the activity of endosomal cathepsin L and the serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, recent scientific advances have expanded our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, uncovering alternative receptors and novel cofactors that may enhance viral tropism and adaptability. Given the critical role of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in mediating host cell entry, it has become a primary target for prevention and therapeutic strategies. However, the continuous spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of S protein variants that may potentially confer a fitness advantage or modify key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology, such as transmissibility, infectivity, antigenicity, and/or pathogenicity, posing significant challenges to the efficacy of current interventions. In this review, we provide an updated and comprehensive overview of the latest advances in SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways and molecular mechanisms, exploring their implications for antiviral drug discovery, vaccine design, and the development of other biomedical strategies while addressing the challenges posed by the ongoing evolution of the virus.">

        <tr id="Bacterial meningitis (BM) requires rapid intervention, especially in immunocompromised populations. Understanding early immune responses is crucial, as they precede clinical symptoms; however, comprehensive studies remain limited. This research investigates immune-related genes to improve BM diagnosis and treatment. Mendelian randomization, differential gene expression analysis, and co-expression network analysis identified key genes associated with BM. Immune cell ratio calculations and infiltration analyses demonstrated altered immune cell proportions. Spearman correlation analysis revealed relationships between gene expression and immune cell types. Single-cell RNA sequencing, gene set enrichment analysis, and pseudotime analysis explored changes in gene expression and cell proportions across disease stages, focusing on the roles of key genes in specific immune cells. Ring Finger Protein 144B (RNF144B) was identified as a risk gene predominantly expressed in monocytes and neutrophils. Conversely, FYN Proto-Oncogene (FYN) was identified as a protective gene primarily associated with NKT cells. During BM onset, increased RNF144B expression positively correlated with elevated neutrophil levels, while reduced FYN expression correlated with decreased NKT cell levels. During remission and recovery, RNF144B expression and neutrophil proportions decreased, whereas FYN expression and NKT cell proportions increased. NKT cells appeared to play a protective role, with FYN potentially modulating T-cell receptor function in these cells, thereby reducing BM risk. RNF144B and FYN expression exhibit opposing trends in peripheral blood across BM stages, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring. These findings provide a valuable reference for early intervention strategies and personalized treatment approaches tailored to specific disease stages in the clinic.

        <tr id="The incidence rate of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is rising. However, the pathogenesis of CAPA remains unclear. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disrupts pathways related to type I interferon and Toll-like receptors, key components in innate immunity, thereby elevating the incidence of CAPA. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in T and B cell functional deficiencies or exhaustion within adaptive immunity, weakening the defense against invasive Aspergillus. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances the replication of cytomegalovirus and alters the gut microbiota, factors that may aid in diagnosing CAPA. Immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 patients is also believed to heighten the risk of invasive aspergillosis. Therefore, this review, examines the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with invasive aspergillosis, and explores the pathogenesis and susceptibility factors of CAPA. We propose that variations in an individual’s immune response significantly determine susceptibility to CAPA. The aim of this paper is to deepen clinical understanding of CAPA’s pathogenesis, thereby aiding in mitigating susceptibility risk and advancing novel treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="Background During COVID-19 pandemic, men had reduced serum testosterone and higher mortality rate than women. Variations in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were detected in severe COVID-19 individuals. We evaluated the response of testicular macrophages, steroidogenic activity and lipid metabolism of Leydig cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Methods Testes were analyzed under light and electron microscope. Immunolocalization of human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) and viral proteins (spike and nucleocapsid) were evaluated in association with the expression of viral recognition receptor, Rigi. Steroidogenesis was evaluated by the expression of steroidogenic factor-1 (Sf1), and the immunolocalization of steroidogenic proteins and testosterone. Pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines, macrophages (CD68 and CD163) and macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected by immunolocalization and Western blot. The expression of lipid metabolism genes (Srebp, Dgat1 and Scarb1) were investigated by RT-qPCR. Results In the infected animals, the Leydig cells showed enhanced immunolocalization of hACE2, spike and nucleocapsid. The expression of Rigi, pro-inflammatory cytokines and number of macrophages increased, confirming viral infection. Sf1 expression, steroidogenic proteins and testosterone were reduced whereas the expression of Dgat1, Srebp and Scarb1 increased. Lipid droplets-enriched Leydig cells and viral particles in lipids were observed. The infected Leydig cells also showed enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines immunolabeling. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 infects Leydig cells, activates its immune response and impairs steroidogenesis. The virus uses the steroidogenic machinery and induces lipid metabolism pathways for its survival and replication in these cells. These findings support the low testosterone and HDL levels in men with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed unprecedented challenges to public health and economic stability. Central to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is its ability to evade the host immune response by hijacking host pathways via the interaction between viral and host proteins. We identified Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1/2 (G3BP1/G3BP2) as a critical host factor that interacts with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, emerging from a comparative analysis of proteomic data from multiple studies. We revisited the underlying molecular mechanisms by confirming the residues required for the interaction between G3BP1/G3BP2 and SARS-CoV-2 N protein and showed that this interaction disrupts stress granule formation. Intriguingly, we observed that the ablation of both G3BP1 and G3BP2 enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our data collectively supports the notion that G3BP1 and G3BP2 play a critical role in modulating the host–virus interface during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that their multifaceted function in cellular defense extends beyond the stress granule pathway.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic with far-reaching impacts on human activities. Moreover, direct viral damage and uncontrolled inflammation have been proposed as contributing factors to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is also well recognized for its capability to trigger and modulate the host’s innate immune system by attaching to bacterial substances. Nevertheless, the pandemic has further emphasized the critical role of an effective host immune response in controlling viral infection and highlighted the detrimental effect of immune dysregulation. This study aimed to assess plasma levels of LBP and inflammatory biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2 patients with different malnutrition status and severity levels. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh from December 2020 to December 2021. A total of 166 SARS-CoV-2 patients were recruited including 80 critical and 86 non-critical patients. Medical history, anthropometrical parameters, disease outcome information, and relevant biochemical parameters were extracted from medical records. Plasma samples were collected to test for LBP and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, nutritional risk was assessed by the Nutrition Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002) tool. Results: This cross-sectional study found no significant differences in LBP levels between critical and non-critical SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, LBP levels significantly correlated with IL-10, TNF-α and IL-6/IL-10 levels (Spearman’s rho = 0.430, 0.276 and −0.397 respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study confirmed the elevated inflammatory cytokines in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and their association with disease severity and malnutrition. These findings may support the mechanism of gut inflammation in order to develop new interventions that lower inflammatory biomarkers, disease severity, and aid in SARS-CoV-2 prevention and management.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction SARS-CoV-2’s continued global health impact underscores the importance of ongoing pathogenesis research. Insights into the host’s first line of defense against severe COVID-19 identify actionable biomarkers, informing disease management or therapeutics. Yet, the innate immune response, including cytokines, chemokines, adenosine deaminases (ADAs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), relevant to COVID-19 remain incompletely characterized. Methods Peripheral blood was longitudinally collected between May 2020 and March 2021 from COVID-19 hospitalized adults (N = 79) and healthy controls (HCs) (N = 14; not tested, assumed COVID-negative, no viral exposure or symptoms). Heparinized blood was fractionated for plasma cryopreservation and in vitro whole blood TLR-stimulation employing TLR-3, -4, and -7/8 agonists. Post-stimulation culture supernatants were analyzed using multiplex and enzymatic assays. Results Upon hospitalization, plasma concentrations of IFNγ, IL-6, CXCL10, and ADAs were significantly upregulated compared to convalescent time points and HCs. Participants with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs concentrations upon admission. Plasma cytokines, chemokines, and ADAs were positively correlated and associated with distinct temporal patterns. TLR-stimulated cell cultures from patients produced reduced IFNα2, IFNγ, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70 compared to HCs or later time points. Conclusion Higher plasma concentrations of IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs at admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Reduced TLR-mediated IFNα2, IFNγ, and IL-12p70 production suggests COVID dampens Th1-polarizing innate immune responses, providing insight into immunological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction 1-5% of all patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), even those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, continue to have symptoms after initial recovery. Symptoms associated with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PACS) include, among others, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and cognitive dysfunction. Since the dysregulated immune response appears to be caused by the sustained activation of certain immune cells, including monocytes, and the release of specific cytokines, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PACS disease on monocyte subpopulations. Methods Twenty-two healthy and thirty-two patients with PACS were included into this study. We performed blood gas analysis and measured hematological parameters from peripheral blood of PACS patients and compared them with healthy donors. Surface markers to identify monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results PACS patients had higher numbers of intermediate and CD56+ monocytes, whereas the numbers of total monocytes, classical and non-classical monocytes were normal compared to healthy donors. Comparison of patients with and without fatigue, cough, and dyspnea showed no difference in monocyte subset frequencies. However, patients with cognitive dysfunction had increased numbers of non-classical monocytes compared to patients without this symptom. Discussion This suggests a disturbed homeostasis of the monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with PACS.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves dysregulation of innate immune cells including monocytes, especially in progressive MS. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are essential for fatty acid transport and metabolism in multiple cell types. FABP7, a brain-FABP, maintains metabolic function in astrocytes and neural stem cells, but the effect of FABP7 on monocytes is unknown. Here we find elevated levels of FABP7 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with secondary progressive MS. Elevated serum FABP7 levels positively correlate with higher disability scores, brain lesion volumes, and lower brain volumes. FABP7 levels are increased in astrocytes from MS postmortem brain lesion. Mechanistically, in vitro treatment of FABP7 induces CD16, CD80 and IL-1β expression in monocytes via increased glycolysis. FABP7-induced gene expression reflects enhanced inflammation, chemotaxis and glucose metabolism in monocytes. In conclusion, we find that FABP7 induces pro-inflammatory profiles in monocytes, correlates with disability and represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for progressive MS.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Neuroplasticity in the adult colon enables the enteric nervous system (ENS) to adaptively remodel in response to acute inflammation, preserving motility. However, chronic inflammation may drive maladaptive neuroplasticity, resulting in gastrointestinal dysmotility, a hallmark of functional gastrointestinal disorders, including Gulf War illness (GWI). GWI affects ∼30% of Gulf War veterans and has been linked to oral toxic exposures during combat, such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB). To explore mechanisms of persistent dysmotility, we developed a PB exposure model relevant to GWI. In the colon, we observed structural and functional ENS changes, including an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons and altered motility patterns. These were accompanied by a sustained influx of pro-inflammatory macrophages and elevated cytokine levels, indicating persistent low-grade enteric neuroinflammation. Inflammatory macrophages were found near enteric neural stem cells (ENSCs), impairing their regenerative potential. Transcriptomic analyses corroborated the presence of chronic neuroinflammation and dysregulated repair pathways. Together, our findings suggest that persistent enteric neuroinflammation and impaired neurogenesis contribute to long-term colonic dysmotility in GWI. This model offers new insights into chronic ENS dysfunction and may guide therapeutic strategies for GWI and related disorders.">

        <tr id="Cognitive dysfunction represents one of the most persistent and disabling features of Long COVID, yet its molecular underpinnings remain incompletely understood. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term neurocognitive sequelae. Key processes include persistent neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial dysfunction, immune dysregulation, and neuroendocrine imbalance. Microglial activation and cytokine release (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) promote synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury, while activation of inflammasomes such as NLRP3 amplifies CNS inflammation. Vascular abnormalities, including microthrombosis and BBB leakage, facilitate the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and neurotoxic mediators. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction and reduced vagal tone further exacerbate systemic inflammation and autonomic imbalance. Biomarkers such as GFAP, NFL, IL-6, and S100B have been associated with both neuroinflammation and cognitive symptoms. Notably, transcriptomic signatures in Long COVID overlap with those observed in Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting shared pathways involving tau dysregulation, oxidative stress, and glial reactivity. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for identifying at-risk individuals and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. This review underscores the need for longitudinal research and integrative biomarker analysis to elucidate the molecular trajectory of cognitive impairment in Long COVID.">

        <tr id="Background Pathological inflammation with a loss of synaptic integrity and function has been implicated in HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Although therapeutics exist to increase the lifespan of people living with HIV (PLWH), they are not effective at preventing neuroinflammation and HIV induced neuronal damage persists. In this study, we investigate the ephrin-B/EphB axis, which regulates inflammation, in post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and experimental models in order to assess its potential role in HIV induced neuroinflammation. Methods We analyze mRNA samples of post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and uninfected controls obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) and, for comparison, of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Follow-up experiments employ mouse brain tissue and in vitro models, including immortalized human microglia, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mixed neuroglial cell cultures, cellular and molecular interference, functional and multiplex assays, immunofluorescence and mRNA sequencing to examine the role of the ephrin-B/EphB axis in neuroinflammation and the associated neurotoxicity. Results Using qRT-PCR we find increased expression of EphB2 in post-mortem brain of PLWH, and detect a correlation with pro-viral DNA, viral RNA and an inverse correlation with abstract executive function and verbal fluency. Increased expression of ephrin-B/EphB at mRNA and protein level is also observed in brains of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV suggesting the upregulation can be driven, at least in part, by expression of viral gp120 envelope protein and a type I interferon, IFNβ. Additionally, we find induction of ephrin-B1 expression in microglia following activation by IFNβ. Given the previously reported impact of EphB2 on inflammation in the periphery, the functional role of EphB2-mediated ephrin-B reverse signaling on microglia is assessed for a pro-inflammatory and anti-viral signature. We find that EphB2 treated microglia secrete inflammatory and anti-viral factors but also exert contact-independent neurotoxicity. Finally, knockdown of microglial ephrin-B1, an EphB2 binding partner, shows a partial alleviation of the microglial pro-inflammatory signature and neurotoxicity. Conclusion Our study suggests that elevated EphB2, and its reverse signaling through ephrin-B1 in microglia contribute to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in neuroHIV.

        <tr id="Background Monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in phagocytic reactions, which potentially play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Imbalance of these cells in peripheral blood has proven to affect not only innate but also adaptive immunity. It is possible that a search for strategies to restore monocyte activity could be a major step in achieving immune control over COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes and neutrophils, and COVID-19 severity, to assess the effects of a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent on phagocytosis parameters in in-hospital COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods The study included 105 adult patients with moderate COVID-19, who had been hospitalized in 2020–2021 and treated in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. All patients were divided into two groups: in Group 1 patients received standard treatment and Immunovac VP4 therapeutic vaccine, a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent as add-on therapy from Day 1 of hospitalization; in Group 2 patients did not receive any add-on treatment. The study parameters included C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), SpO2, lung involvement on chest computer tomography (CT) scan, and phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood leukocytes based on the absorption activity (AA) of monocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes against S. аureus). The parameters were assessed at 1, 14 and 30 days. Results Based on a cluster analysis of the clinical findings and the results of diagnostic tests obtained on admission, the patients were divided into 2 clusters: cluster 1 including patients with a more severe disease (n = 34) and cluster 2 including patients with a less severe disease (n = 71). Cluster 1 patients had higher levels of CRP (20.1 vs. 2.2 mg/mL, p < 0.001), AST (32.9 vs. 26.2 U/L, p = 0.003), lower SpO2 (94% vs. 96%, p < 0,001) and more extensive lung involvement on chest CT scan (35% vs. 12%, p < 0,001). There was a statistically significant direct correlation between blood monocyte AA and SpO2 (p = 0.04), an inverse correlation between monocyte AA and CRP (p = 0.003) and the extent of lung involvement on CT scan (p = 0.05). In less severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 2), no statistically significant correlation was observed. In more severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 1), there was a rise in monocyte AA on day 30 of hospitalization both in the control group (from 86.6 to 92.2, p = 0.03) and the main group, who received Immunovac VP4 add-on therapy (from 87.3 to 98.3, p = 0.05). However, the patients who received the immunostimulating agent, had higher monocyte PI than the controls, without the immunostimulant (p = 0.05). Patients from cluster 1 who were given Immunovac VP4 had higher SpO2 levels (98% vs. 97%, p = 0.01) than those who had received only the standard treatment. Discussion Blood monocyte AA correlates with COVID-19 severity: patients with less severe disease have higher AA and those with more severe illness have lower AA. The standard treatment, combined with Immunovac VP4 enhances phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes, which is associated with a more marked increase in SpO2, especially in more severe patients.">

        <tr id="Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is characterized by complex interactions within its tumor microenvironment. Understanding the immune landscape and gene expression patterns is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Methods We employed multiple analytical approaches including Mendelian randomization analysis, single-cell sequencing, gene expression profiling, and spatiotemporal analysis. The study investigated associations between NPC and comorbidities, characterized immune cell populations, and analyzed gene expression patterns. Cytokine profiles and their effects on disease risk were also examined. Results The analysis revealed potential associations between NPC and both allergic rhinitis and high myopia. Single-cell sequencing identified distinct cellular populations, including three unique B cell subpopulations (M1, M2, M3) with specific molecular signatures and spatial distributions. Temporal analysis showed dynamic changes in immune cell composition: endothelial and epithelial cells dominated the early phase, B cells peaked in the middle phase, and dendritic and T cells increased in the late phase. Gene expression clustered into four main patterns, with significant roles for immune-related genes, particularly the TNFRSF family and HLA-related genes. Cytokine analysis identified IL-6 as a significant risk factor (31.4% increased risk) while IL-10 showed protective effects (8% risk reduction). Conclusions This comprehensive analysis provides detailed insights into the complex immune microenvironment and molecular mechanisms of NPC. The identification of distinct cellular populations, temporal patterns, and key molecular players offers valuable information for understanding disease progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.">

Early detection is challenging due to heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Understanding cellular and molecular changes from preclinical (pre-SLE) to clinical stages is essential for early intervention. Polygenic risk score (PRS) has been widely used to identify subjects at risk. However, the immune dysregulation of subjects with high SLE-PRS has never been demonstrated. This study aims to delineate the cellular transcriptomic landscapes of healthy controls, pre-SLE, and SLE patients using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular signatures associated with disease progression.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 10 healthy controls, 23 pre-SLE patients with top 5% SLE-PRS without previous diagnosis of SLE, and 12 SLE patients. scRNA-seq was performed using the BD Rhapsody. Data was processed and analyzed with Seurat and other bioinformatics tools to identify differentially expressed genes and pathway enrichments across cell types and patient groups.The analysis revealed distinct transcriptional profiles among the 3 groups. PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were clustered and annotated into 5 major cell types: B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, and NK cells, as shown by UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). Additionally, the cells were further categorized into myeloid and lymphoid lineages. The myeloid-to-lymphoid (M/L) ratio progressively increased in the healthy controls to pre-SLE and SLE patients, indicating an elevated myeloid cell presence as the disease progresses (Figure 1). To identify key immune cell types within the lymphoid subsets, further clustering and analysis of immune cell were performed to resolve immune subpopulations (Figure 2). Differential gene expression between pre-SLE patients and healthy controls was visualized using volcano plots across key immune cell populations (Figure 3). Notably, pre-SLE patients exhibited significant upregulation of genes associated with early immune activation and dysregulation, such as IFI44L and IGKC, suggesting that these genes may act as potential molecular drivers in the pathogenesis of SLE.Figure 1.UMAP clustering of immune cells from healthy controls, pre-SLE, and SLE patients with distinct color-coded cell types. The accompanying table and scatter plot demonstrate an elevated myeloid-to-lymphoid ratio in pre-SLE and SLE, highlighting immune composition shifts.Figure 2.UMAP with subcluster analysis of immune cell types, displaying specific populations such as memory B cells and T cell subsets.Figure 3.Volcano plots show differentially expressed genes in various immune cell populations between pre-SLE and healthy controls.Our findings demonstrate progressive immune dysregulation at the single-cell level from pre-SLE to SLE patients. The identified molecular signatures, altered cell subsets, and immune composition shifts provide insights into SLE pathogenesis and suggest potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. The virus primarily spreads through person-to-person contact via aerosols and droplets, contributing to high case numbers and related morbidities. SARS-CoV-2 targets the respiratory tract, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as those with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a life-threatening genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to impaired respiratory function and recurrent severe respiratory symptoms. Despite their potential vulnerability, CF patients have shown a lower incidence of severe COVID-19, suggesting protective factors against SARS-CoV-2. Differential expression of the ACE2 receptor, crucial for viral entry, and other host factors, such as TMPRSS2, may play a role in this resistance to SARS-CoV-2. Analyzing the genomics and transcriptomics profiles of CF patients could provide insights into potential resistance mechanisms. The potential resistance mechanisms include blood and extracellular ATP levels, a deleted/dysfunctional CFTR gene, ACE and ACE2 regulation and expression, ACE and ACE2 polymorphism effects, host proteins and SARS-CoV-2 interactions, and SMN1 and ACE/ACE2 interactions. This review discusses the underlying factors and potential resistance mechanisms contributing to CF patients’ responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review provides an opportunity to further investigate future therapy and research through understanding the underlying potential resistance mechanisms exhibited by CF patients against SARS-CoV-2, including ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms.">

        <tr id="The mechanism by which chronic systemic inflammation contributes to cerebral endothelial dysfunction and neurological disorders is unclear, although endothelial inflammatory signalling is considered a cornerstone of this process. Here, we have performed transcriptomic analysis of published RNASeq datasets and identified consistent upregulation of the Tumour Necrosis Factor—C‐X‐C Motif Chemokine Ligand 10 (TNF‐CXCL10) signalling pathway in mouse cerebral endothelial cells following a single inflammatory challenge. We subsequently investigated the effects of repeated low‐level inflammation on the modulation of this pathway in a mouse cerebral endothelial cell line, analysing the effect on markers of endothelial cell activation and changes in cellular function, as a potential mechanism underlying the cerebrovascular response to low‐level systemic inflammation. Mouse cerebral endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were exposed to hour‐long treatments with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), a single low concentration of TNF (0.5 ng/mL), repeated low‐concentration TNF (0.5 ng/mL, 1 h × 4 days) or a single cumulative concentration of TNF (2.0 ng/mL). RNA and protein were extracted 4 and 24 h after the final treatment for analysis of gene/protein expression using qRT‐PCR and western blotting. Repeated inflammatory challenge significantly upregulated both Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1) and CXCL10 at the mRNA and protein levels. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and phosphorylated‐STAT1 (pSTAT1) protein levels were also increased at 4 and 24 h. Differentially, tumor necrosis factor receptor‐associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and Interferon gamma (IFNγ) gene expression were decreased at 4 h, returning to control levels at 24 h. Functional analysis revealed significant increases in endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis in the presence of repeated TNF exposure. CXCL10 knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced mean caspase 3/7 activity induced by the repeated inflammatory paradigm. These data suggest an upregulation of the TNF‐CXCL10 pathway in response to low‐level repetitive inflammation in mouse cerebral endothelial cells. Modulation of this pathway may represent a broad therapeutic target for neurovascular disease.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder of abnormal B-lymphocytes. Due to immune deregulation and therapy-related factors, CLL individuals face increased infection risks, making vaccination a priority. Although COVID-19 is no longer a global emergency, understanding vaccine responses in this vulnerable population, especially those undergoing active cancer treatments, remains critical for broader infectious disease prevention strategies. We have characterized the humoral and cellular immune response of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination elicited by CLL individuals under standard-of-care treatment and watch and wait (W&W) strategy compared with healthy subjects who received a three-dose regimen six months ago. Seroconversion rates varied between 81.8% and 71.4% in individuals under W&W and dropped to 28.6%-22.2% in those under treatment, with antibody titres and neutralizing activity following the same pattern, highlighting the impact of active therapies on vaccine immunogenicity. Analysis of B-cell dynamics revealed that individuals under W&W maintained the highest levels of total B cells (CD19+) throughout the study (up to 3.5-fold higher than healthy donors, p<0.0001). Basal naïve B cells were markedly reduced across CLL groups (up to 4.3-fold lower in treated vs. W&W, p<0.0001), while memory subsets expanded over time, particularly in the W&W cohort after booster vaccination. Additionally, we found that the actively treated CLL group exhibited higher levels of cytotoxic cells (including CD8+ T cells and NK cells) when compared to the W&W or the healthy population groups. However, none of these cell populations demonstrated an increased activation capacity. Moreover, the direct cytotoxic capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CLL persons was also more efficient in the W&W group. Through our comprehensive characterization of both humoral and cellular immune responses in CLL individuals, this study provides insight into the complex immunological landscape following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Our detailed analysis supports the current vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2 for CLL patients, confirming its effectiveness and underscoring the importance of close monitoring and representing a significant advancement in our understanding of immune responses in hematological malignancies.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: COVID-19 has been associated with a wide range of immune responses, including the production of autoantibodies, particularly in severe cases. This study investigates the IgG autoantibody responses in patients with varying severities of COVID-19 infection and compares these responses with vaccinated individuals. Methods: We utilized proteomic profiling to analyze autoantibody reactivity against a broad spectrum of proteins expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets in serum samples from severe and moderate COVID-19 patients, as well as vaccinated individuals who received the inactivated CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccine. Results: Our findings indicate a marked increase in the diversity and number of IgG autoantibodies targeting intracellular and membrane-associated proteins in severe COVID-19 cases, compared to those with moderate cases of the disease. The autoantibody response in severe cases was found to primarily target proteins involved in immune cell activation, signaling, and differentiation, suggesting potential pathways of immune dysregulation and autoimmunity. In contrast, vaccinated individuals did not exhibit similar autoantibody reactivity, pointing to a more controlled immune response post-vaccination. Notably, no significant autoimmune responses were detected in the vaccinated cohort, suggesting that the inactivated vaccine does not induce autoreactive IgG. These findings align with the established safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines, especially in comparison to the heightened immune dysregulation observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The absence of a significant autoantibody response in vaccinated individuals supports the notion that vaccines, while inducing robust immune activation, do not typically trigger autoimmunity in healthy individuals. Conclusions: Our study underscores the importance of distinguishing between the immune responses triggered by infection and vaccination and highlights the need for the continued monitoring of autoimmune responses in severe COVID-19 cases. Future research should focus on the long-term persistence and clinical relevance of these autoantibodies, particularly in individuals with pre-existing autoimmune conditions or genetic predispositions.">

        <tr id="The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has threatened human health worldwide. Among protective immune reactions, T cell responses are diverse among individuals, which is related to the differences in severity. A T cell subset, regulatory T (Treg) cells, is crucial for limiting excessive immune responses. If SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs are developed during infection, they may counteract anti-viral immunity and cause severe symptom. To address this possibility, we conducted single-cell TCR-RNA-sequencing of PBMCs from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Among thirteen donors, one with severe symptom had substantially more FOXP3-expressing Treg clonotypes activated in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virion or other major antigen proteins. To define the reactivity of these Treg clonotypes, fifteen highly expanded Treg clonotypes were reconstituted into reporter cells and stimulated with 27 distinct peptide pools that cover all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However, none of these clonotypes react to any SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Instead, the reporter cells expressing one TCR clonotype (23599) were activated in the presence of EBV-transformed B cells without adding exogenous antigens. Furthermore, 23599 TCR-expressing cells were activated by non-transformed naïve syngenic B cells in DQA1*03:03-DQB1*04:01-dependent manner, suggesting that clonotype 23599 may be autoreactive. This Treg clonotype, 23599, was also detected in a public TCR database, and significantly expanded in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not the dominant antigen inducing Treg during infection.">

        <tr id="Severity of COVID-19 is affected by multiple factors; however, it is not understood how the inflammatory milieu of the lung at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure affects the control of viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that immune events in the mouse lung closely preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection affect viral control and identify innate immune pathways that limit viral replication. Pulmonary inflammatory stimuli including resolved, antecedent respiratory infections with Staphylococcus aureus or influenza, ongoing pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, ovalbumin/alum-induced asthma, or airway administration of TLR ligands and recombinant cytokines all establish an antiviral state in the lung that restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to antiviral type I interferons, TNFα and IL-1 potently precondition the lung for enhanced viral control. Our work shows that SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from an immunologically quiescent lung microenvironment and suggests that heterogeneity in pulmonary inflammation preceding SARS-CoV-2 exposure may contribute to variability in disease outcomes.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play a pivotal role in the immune response against viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. However, our understanding of memory NK cell responses in the context of SARS-CoV-2 remains limited. To address this, we investigated the memory-like response of NK cells to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, presented by autologous cells. Blood samples from 45 donors underwent analysis for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, categorizing them into four groups based on the antibody kind and level. NK cells from SARS-CoV-2-experienced donors demonstrated enhanced degranulation and activation levels, IFNγ production and proliferative potential in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Investigation of highly proliferating NK cells demonstrated the formation of distinct clusters depending on the SARS-CoV-2 peptide supplementation and the donor group. RNA sequencing revealed differential gene expression patterns, highlighting metabolism, protein transport, and immune response genes. Notably, KIR2DS4 expression correlated with enhanced IFNγ production, degranulation and proliferation levels, suggesting a role in SARS-CoV-2 recognition. Collectively, these findings provide detailed insights into antigen-specific NK cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, indicating potential mechanisms underlying NK cell activation in antiviral immunity.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains endemic worldwide. Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B and T lymphocytes in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has been the most severe public health emergency since 2019. Currently, the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the most dominant. The most prominent symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory. Meanwhile, the fatality of COVID-19 was mainly from pneumonia. However ,in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have pneumonia and those who do not, the differences in the immune repertoire still require further investigation.We conducted seven-chain adaptome immune repertoire analyses on patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, both with and without pulmonary infiltration.Patients with pulmonary infiltration exhibit lymphopenia, a decreased proportion of the overall TCR repertoire alongside an increased BCR repertoire, reduced IGHD and IGHM isotype expression, a shorter mean CDR3 length for TRG, and a longer mean length for TRD, as well as diminished clonality and diversity in the TCR/BCR repertoire. Meanwhile, patients with pulmonary infiltration have distinct V-J gene usage and unique CDR3 signature, as well as BCR class switch recombination pattern. Finally, prior vaccination triggered less BCR IGHM/IGHD somatic hypermutation response, preserved the diversity of the entire adaptive immune repertoire, and provided clinical protection against severe or critical conditions following Omicron infection.We report a unique, comprehensive adaptive immune system signature in patients with pulmonary infiltration, which may serve as potential immunological biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="It is important to be able to retrospectively determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections with high accuracy, both for post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiological studies, and to distinguish between Long COVID and other multi-syndromic diseases that have overlapping symptoms. Although serum antibody levels can be measured to retrospectively diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, peptide stimulation of memory T cell responses is a more sensitive approach. This is because robust memory T cells are generated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and persist even after antibodies wane below detectability thresholds. In this study, we compare T cell responses using FluoroSpot-based methods and overnight stimulation of whole blood with SARS-CoV-2 peptides followed by an ELISA. Both approaches have comparable sensitivity and specificity but require different equipment and samples to be used. Furthermore, the elimination of peptides that cross-react with other coronaviruses increases the assay specificity but trades off some sensitivity. Finally, this approach can be used on archival, cryopreserved PBMCs. This work shows comparative advantages for several methods to measure SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses that could be utilized by any laboratory studying the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.">

Coronavirus interactions with host innate immune antiviral responses are an important determinant of disease outcome. This review compares the host's innate response to different human coronaviruses. Host antiviral defenses discussed in this review include frontline defenses against respiratory viruses in the nasal epithelium, early sensing of viral infection by innate immune effectors, double-stranded RNA and stress-induced antiviral pathways, and viral antagonism of innate immune responses conferred by conserved coronavirus nonstructural proteins and genus-specific accessory proteins. The common cold coronaviruses HCoV-229E and -NL63 induce robust interferon signaling and related innate immune pathways, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 induce intermediate levels of activation, and MERS-CoV shuts down these pathways almost completely.">

Despite the presence of infection- and vaccine-induced immunity, SARS-CoV-2 infections remain a major global health concern because of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that can cause severe acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or enhance Long Covid disease phenotypes. About 5 to 10% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop Long Covid, which, similar to acute COVID 19, often affects the lung. However, Long Covid can also affect other peripheral organs, especially the brain. The causal relationships between acute disease phenotypes, long-term symptoms, and involvement of multiple organ systems remain elusive, and animal model systems mimicking both acute and post-acute phases are imperative. Here, we review the current state of Long Covid animal models, including current and possible future applications.">

The susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection are influenced by various host factors, including hormonal changes, genetic variations, inflammatory biomarkers, and behavioral attitudes. Identifying genetic factors contributing to infection severity may accelerate therapeutic development, including drug repurposing, natural extracts, and post-vaccine interventions (Initiative and Covid, 2021).

        <tr id="It has been reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can result in long-term neurological symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, however the specific mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Initially, we confirmed a reduction in the level of synaptic proteins in SH-SY5Y neurons following SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 Nsps are crucial for the efficient replication of the virus and play important roles in the interaction between virus and host cell. Nsps screening experiments implied that Nsp7 is able to reduce the level of synapsin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Nsp7 in SH-SY5Y cells and mouse primary neurons demonstrated that Nsp7 could decrease the levels of synaptic proteins without affecting neuronal viability. Moreover, C57BL/6 mice receiving AAV-GFP-Nsp7 injections into the ventral hippocampus displayed impaired memory ability, along with reduced dendritic spine density and synaptic protein levels. Mechanistic investigations suggested that Nsp7-induced mitochondrial damage led to ROS production and ATP levels decreasing in neurons. Additional experiments employing the ROS inhibitor NAC demonstrated that Nsp7 suppressed the expression of synaptic proteins via ROS inducing, implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in synaptic plasticity impairment and subsequent cognitive dysfunction. Our findings underscore the crucial role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7 in cognitive dysfunction, which is potentially mediated through impaired synaptic plasticity via mitochondrial damage. This study enhances our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying central nervous system-related symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background To date, it is still not clear why during the COVID-19 pandemic children generally developed no or milder symptoms compared to adults. As innate immune responses are crucial in the early defense against pathogens, we aimed at profiling these responses from both adults and children with a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In the first months of the pandemic, PBMCs and serum were collected from peripheral blood of adults and children at different time points after testing SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive (PCR+). The levels of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific IgG were measured in serum. The cells were cultured for 24 hours in medium only, with heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (iSARS-CoV-2) or toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. The levels of secreted cytokines/chemokines as well as monocyte phenotype were determined. Results Few days after testing PCR+, PBMCs from PCR+ children secreted higher levels of cytokines/chemokines compared to PCR+ adults, after these cells were incubated either in medium only or after stimulation with iSARS-CoV-2 or TLR ligands. Furthermore, PBMCs from children stimulated with iSARS-CoV-2 secreted significantly higher levels of IL-10 and GM-CSF compared to PBMCs from control children. In contrast, PBMCs from the PCR+ adults secreted lower levels of IL-8 compared to adult controls. Phenotypic analysis of monocytes indicates a smaller proportion non-classical monocytes for adults compared to children. The distinct cytokine profiles, symptom severity, and the proportion of non-classical monocytes correlated to each other. The levels of Spike-specific IgG overtime did not significantly differ between children and adults. Conclusions Within the first week after testing PCR+, children showed a stronger inflammatory innate immune profile and experienced less severe symptoms compared to adults. Our data implies correlations between the secretion of cytokines/chemokines, proportion of non-classical monocytes, and symptoms severity. These findings enhance our understanding of the distinct pediatric and adult innate immune profile after SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes to the knowledge necessary to improve future prevention strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to numerous cases of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), worldwide. This co-infection has increased patient mortality due to the lack of efficient bi-targeted drugs. Cambogin, a bioactive natural product, has been shown to effectively induce regression of KSHV-latently infected tumours in xenograft mice models; however, its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Here, we report that Cambogin targets 46 host genes commonly affected by both SARS-CoV-2 and KSHV infections, as identified through bioinformatics analysis. These genes are related with 14 key upstream signalling pathways, particularly those involved in inflammation regulation, protein phosphorylation, metabolic processes, and cellular stress response. Within the transcriptional factor (TF)-miRNA co-regulatory network, ten out of 46 hub-target genes are closely linked to Cambogin and KSHV/SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, Cambogin not only efficiently blocks the replication and virion production of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo by reducing the expression of EGFR and Cyclin A2, but also simultaneously inhibits both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the growth of KSHV-induced tumours in vivo using a murine xenograft model. These findings provide an alternative strategy for the potential use of Cambogin in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients, particularly those with KSHV co-infection.">

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is characterized by persistent symptoms following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and has emerged as a significant health concern. As SARS‐CoV‐2 evolved from the wild‐type strain to the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants, there may be a variant‐specific influence on long COVID akin to the acute disease. This review aims to summarize our current knowledge of variant‐specific influences in long COVID incidence, symptom profile as well as mechanisms of pathogenesis. We highlight that long COVID incidence may be lower with the Omicron variants. The symptom profile of long COVID may also show some dependence on the different variants, with a reduction in cardiopulmonary symptoms with more recent SARS‐CoV‐2 variants. This heterogeneity of long COVID may also be related to the variant‐specific differences in affecting the immune system, viral persistence, and autoimmunity. However, emerging data also suggest that vaccinations may play a big role in shaping the presentation of long COVID. We also highlight ongoing work on long COVID incidence and symptom profiles in populations infected only by the Omicron variants. This will be beneficial toward more useful disease definitions and the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.">

Using CRISPR knockout and MS4A4A-degrading antibodies in primary human microglia, non-human primates (NHP), and a xenotransplantation model of amyloid pathology, we provide evidence that MS4A4A and MS4A6A are negative regulators of both the transmembrane and soluble TREM2 proteins. They also negatively regulate microglia proliferation, survival, metabolism, lysosomal function, energetics, phagocytosis, and disease-fighting states. Mechanistically, we find that MS4A4A exerts negative regulation by interacting with MS4A6A and protecting it from degradation. MS4A6A in turn forms a complex with and blocks the co-receptor DAP12, which is required for the stability, cell surface localization, and signaling of TREM2 and other receptors. Taken together, the data indicate that MS4A4A and MS4A6A are cooperating, post-transcriptional negative regulators of TREM2 and microglial function, and potential drug targets for AD.">

        <tr id="Long Covid is defined by a wide range of symptoms that persist after the acute phase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Commonly reported symptoms include fatigue, weakness, postexertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction, with many other symptoms reported. Symptom range, duration, and severity are highly variable and partially overlap with symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and other post-acute infectious syndromes, highlighting opportunities to define shared mechanisms of pathogenesis. Potential mechanisms of Long Covid are diverse, including persistence of viral reservoirs, dysregulated immune responses, direct viral damage of tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, inflammation driven by reactivation of latent viral infections, vascular endothelium activation or dysfunction, and subsequent thromboinflammation, autoimmunity, metabolic derangements, microglial activation, and microbiota dysbiosis. The heterogeneity of symptoms and baseline characteristics of people with Long Covid, as well as the varying states of immunity and therapies given at the time of acute infection, have made etiologies of Long Covid difficult to determine. Here, we examine progress on preclinical models for Long Covid and review progress being made in clinical trials, highlighting the need for large human studies and further development of models to better understand Long Covid. Such studies will inform clinical trials that will define treatments to benefit those living with this condition.">

The persistent effects of COVID-19 have become a subject of significant concern amongst the medical and scientific community. This article aims to explore the probability of a link between the COVID-19 infection and the risk of lung cancer development. First, this article reports that SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammatory response and cellular stress, potentially leading to tumorigenesis through common pathways between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer. These pathways include the JAK/STAT3 pathway which is activated after the initiation of cytokine storm following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This pathway is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and immune homeostasis. The JAK/STAT3 pathway is also hyperactivated in lung cancer which serves as a link thereof. It predisposes patients to lung cancer through myriad molecular mechanisms such as DNA damage, genomic instability, and cell cycle dysregulation. Another probable pathway to tumorigenesis is based on the possibility of an oncogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 through hijacking the p53 protein, leading to cell oxidative stress and interfering with the DNA repair mechanisms. Finally, this article highlights the overexpression of the SLC22A18 gene in lung cancer. This gene can be overexpressed by the ZEB1 transcription factor, which was found to be highly expressed during COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="Understanding the early interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human airway epithelial cells is essential for unraveling viral replication and spread mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the early dynamics of airway epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection using well-differentiated human nasal and tracheal epithelial cell cultures by incorporating three publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We identified a previously uncharacterized cell population, termed virus-rich intermediate (VRI) cells, representing an intermediate differentiation stage between basal and ciliated cells. These VRI cells exhibited high viral loads at all infection time points, strong interferon and inflammatory responses, increased mRNA expression of microvilli-related genes (PAK1, PAK4, VIL1), and suppression of apoptosis markers (BAX, CASP3) alongside increased anti-apoptotic gene expression (BCL2). Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that VRI cells send signals to basal cells via receptor-ligand pathways such as EPHA and VEGF, likely promoting basal cell differentiation and proliferation through MAPK signaling. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes VRI cells as a primary site for replication and spread, leveraging these cells’ unique differentiation state to evade host cell death and facilitate viral propagation. This study provides insights into the early cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights potential therapeutic targets to limit viral spread.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the worst pandemics in human history. The causative virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can invade host cells in multiple organs by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II expressed on the cell surface. Once inside the host cell, viral replication takes place, leading to cellular disruption and the release of signal molecules that are recognised by the innate immune system. Innate immunity activation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and primes the adaptive immune system. The proinflammatory environment defends against further viral entry and replication. SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to lead to myocardial injury through several mechanisms. Firstly, direct viral-mediated cellular invasion of cardiomyocytes has been shown in in vitro and histological studies, which is related to cellular injury. Secondly, the proinflammatory state during COVID-19 can lead to myocardial injury and the release of protein remnants of the cardiac contractile machinery. Thirdly, the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is associated with thromboembolism of coronary arteries and/or other vascular systems. COVID-19 patients can also develop heart failure; however, the underlying mechanism is much less well-characterised than for myocardial injury. Several questions remain regarding COVID-19-related heart failure, including its potential reversibility, the role of anti-viral medications in its prevention, and the mechanisms underlying heart failure pathogenesis in long COVID-19. Further work is required to improve our understanding of the mechanism of cardiac sequelae in COVID-19, which may enable us to target SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients against longer-lasting cardiovascular complications.">

 Knowledge regarding the impact of respiratory pathogen co-infection in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected children seeking emergency department care is limited, specifically as it relates to the association between SARS-CoV-2 viral co-infection and disease severity and factors associated with co-infection.



 This secondary analysis included data from 2 prospective cohort studies conducted between March 2020 and February 2022 that included children <18 years of age tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection along with additional respiratory viruses in a participating emergency department. Outcomes included the detection rate of other respiratory viruses and the occurrence of severe outcomes (ie, intensive interventions, severe organ impairment and death).



 We included 2520 participants, of whom 388 (15.4%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive. Detection of additional respiratory viruses occurred in 18.3% (71/388) of SARS-CoV-2-positive children, with rhinovirus/enterovirus being most frequently detected (42/388; 10.8%). In multivariable analyses (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval), among SARS-CoV-2-positive children, detection of another respiratory virus was not associated with severe outcomes [1.74 (0.80–3.79)], but detection of rhinovirus/enterovirus [vs. isolated SARS-CoV-2 detection 3.56 (1.49–8.51)] and having any preexisting chronic medical condition [2.15 (1.06–4.36)] were associated with severe outcomes. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive children, characteristics independently associated with an increased odds of any other viral co-infection included: age and delta variant infection.



 Approximately 1 in 5 children infected with SARS-CoV-2 had co-infection with another respiratory virus, and co-infection with rhinovirus/enterovirus was associated with severe outcomes. When public health restrictions were relaxed, co-infections increased.

With the recently developed mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 stain, we are now able to model the mild COVID infection in C57BL/6 mice and study the chronic immune responses and subsequent damages in different organs long after the viruses are clearly naturally in the body. More specifically, we found adult C57BL/6J mice developed neurological impairments, including behavior changes related to sensorimotor coordination, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inflammation in multiple organs including lung, liver and brain, which persisted over at least 4 weeks in mice even with mild infection. Therefore, this model can be used to further explopred the mechanisms of PASC, as well as potential intervention or therapeutic approaches.">

Beyond its primary respiratory impact, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in various extra-pulmonary complications. Research studies reveal that the virus affects multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system (CNS), largely due to the widespread expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. Clinical evidence shows that the virus can induce diabetes by disrupting pancreatic and liver functions as well as cause acute kidney injury. Additionally, neurological complications, including cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation, have been observed in a significant number of COVID-19 patients. This review discusses the mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 to acute kidney injury, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), emphasizing its effects on pancreatic beta cells, insulin resistance, and the regulation of gluconeogenesis. We also explore how SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological complications, detailing the intricate pathways of neuro-invasion and the potential to trigger conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). By elucidating the metabolic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, this review underscores the imperative for continued research and the development of effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term and short-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Alarmingly, approximately one in four individuals diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience varying degrees of cognitive impairment, raising concerns about a potential increase in neurological sequelae cases. Neuroinflammation seems to be the key pathophysiological hallmark linking mild respiratory COVID-19 to cognitive impairment, fatigue, and neurological sequelae in COVID-19 patients, highlighting the interaction between the nervous and immune systems following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the virus disrupts physiological pathways to trigger inflammation within the CNS, potentially leading to neuronal damage. These include neuroinvasion, systemic inflammation, disruption of the lung and gut-brain axes, and reactivation of latent viruses. This review explores the potential origins of neuroinflammation and the underlying neuroimmune cross-talk, highlighting important unanswered questions in the field. Addressing these fundamental issues could enhance our understanding of the virus's impact on the CNS and inform strategies to mitigate its detrimental effects.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2; over the course of the disease, a dysregulated immune response leads to excessive inflammation that damages lung parenchyma and compromises its function. One of the cell lineages classically associated with pathological inflammatory processes is mast cells (MCs). MCs and their mediators have been associated with COVID-19; we previously reported the role of carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) in severe COVID-19. However, sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been poorly studied. In patients who successfully resolve the infection, one of the reported sequelae is pulmonary fibrosis (PF). The etiology and exact mechanisms are unknown, and few studies exist. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether MCs are associated with PF development after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings demonstrate that during severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an increased amount of CPA3+ MCs in areas with pneumonia, around thrombotic blood vessels, and in fibrotic tissue. Moreover, higher numbers of CPA3-expressing MCs correlate with fibrotic tissue development (r = 0.8323; p = 0.001170). These results suggest that during COVID-19, exacerbated inflammation favors the recruitment or expansion of MCs and CPA3 expression in the lungs, which favors tissue damage and a failure of repair mechanisms, leading to fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) represent two public health emergencies. In severe disease, both pathogens may share a biological niche in the lower respiratory tract. There is significant potential for SARS-CoV-2 and M.tb infections to be co-present within individuals and enhance or moderate the respective outcomes of either infection. Here, we investigated how whole blood samples, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, from individuals hospitalised with acute COVID-19 disease respond to mycobacterial challenge. To do this, samples were assessed by ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assays, immune cell phenotyping by mass cytometry, and whole blood cytokine responses to mycobacterial antigens assessed by flow cytometry. These studies identified a subgroup of COVID-19 patients whose blood had an enhanced capacity to inhibit mycobacterial growth. The ability to control mycobacterial growth was associated with the presence of a non M.tb-specific CD28+ CD8+ T cell population, with a particular activation status and migratory phenotype. This work improves our understanding of factors involved in mycobacterial control, and may contribute to the design of novel therapies for TB.">

        <tr id="The cytokine storm associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the most distinctive pathological signatures in COVID-19 patients. Macrophages respond to this pro-inflammatory challenge by reprogramming their functional and metabolic phenotypes. Interestingly, human macrophages fail to express the inducible form of the NO synthase (NOS2) in response to pro-inflammatory activation and, therefore, NO is not synthesized by these cells. The contribution of exogenously added NO, via a chemical NO-donor, on the immunometabolic changes associated with the cytokine storm is investigated. By using metabolic, transcriptomic, and functional assays the effect of NO in human macrophages is evaluated and found specific responses. Moreover, through integrative fluxomic analysis, pathways modified by NO that contribute to the expression of a particular phenotype in human macrophages are identified, which includes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and TCA with a slight increase in the glycolytic flux. A significant ROS increase and preserved cell viability are observed in the presence of NO, which may ease the inflammatory response and host defense. Also, NO reverses the cytokine storm-induced itaconate accumulation. These changes offer additional clues to understanding the potential crosstalk between NO and the COVID-19 cytokine storm-dependent signaling pathways.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 and other pandemic viruses continue being important for public health and the global economy. Therefore, it is essential to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19 more deeply, particularly its association with inflammatory and antiviral processes. In this study, we used the RNA-seq technique to analyze mRNA and non-coding RNA profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals after SARS-CoV-2 in vitro exposure, to identify pathways related to immune response and the regulatory post-transcriptional mechanisms triggered that can serve as possible complementary therapeutic targets. Our analyses show that SARS-CoV-2 induced a significant regulation in the expression of 790 genes in PBMCs, of which 733 correspond to mRNAs and 57 to non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The immune response, antiviral response, signaling, cell proliferation and metabolism are the main biological processes involved. Among these, the inflammatory response groups the majority of regulated genes with an increase in the expression of chemokines involved in the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and T-cells. Additionally, it was observed that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 induces the expression of genes related to the IL-27 pathway but not of IFN-I or IFN-III, indicating the induction of ISGs through this pathway rather than the IFN genes. Moreover, several lncRNA and RNA binding proteins that can act in the cis-regulation of genes of the IL-27 pathway were identified. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can regulate the expression of multiple genes in PBMCs, mainly related to the inflammatory and antiviral response. Among these, lncRNAs establish an important mechanism in regulating the immune response to the virus. They could contribute to developing severe forms of COVID-19, constituting a possible therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Background: The pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to severe immune responses and inflammation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this context, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) has a crucial role in inhibiting cytokine-induced immune responses. On the other hand, interleukin-29 (IL-29) and lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) are important molecules involved in inducing immune responses. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the mRNA levels of SOCS1, IL-29, and LYST in the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe symptoms. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 70 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with severe symptoms and 70 healthy controls were evaluated. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood and after cDNA synthesis, the mRNA levels of SOCS1, IL-29, and LYST were assessed by Real-Time PCR technique Results: The study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients exhibited a significant increase in mRNA levels of IL-29 compared to healthy individuals. However, there were no observed alterations in the mRNA levels of SOCS1 and LYST in the patient group. Conclusions: The results emphasize the importance of IL-29 as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 cases. Further research is needed to investigate the specific mechanisms through which IL-29 influences immune responses and contributes to the development of severe disease. Additionally, exploring other factors that may regulate SOCS1 and LYST expression could provide a more comprehensive understanding of their roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The RNA binding protein TIA1 is known to regulate stress responses. Here we show that TIA1 plays a much broader role in inflammatory cells, being required for the microglial sensome. We crossed TIA1 cKO mice (using a CX3CR1 driven cre element) to PS19 MAPT P301S tauopathy mice. The peripheral macrophages of TIA1 cKO mice exhibited a hyper-inflammatory phenotype with increased cytokine signaling, as expected. Surprisingly, the brains of these mice showed striking reductions in inflammation, including decreases in microglial inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL-1β) and sensome markers (CLEC7A, TREM2, ITGAX); these reductions were accompanied by corresponding decreases in tau pathology. Analysis of the brain TIA1 protein interactome identified brain selective TIA1 protein mediated pathways, including strong interactions with the microglial protein C1q, which directs pruning of dystrophic neurons. These results uncover a previously unknown regulatory role for TIA1 in microglial activation in the context of neurodegenerative disease and highlights the divergent regulation of two mononuclear phagocytic lineages: microglia and macrophages.">

A subset meets diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Several studies have reported persistence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA in serum or tissues of both recovered individuals and PCS patients. In this exploratory study, we investigated whether serum spike protein is associated with PCS and whether it correlates with symptom severity and laboratory biomarkers. We analyzed serum spike protein levels in 121 PCS patients following mild-to-moderate COVID 19, 72 of whom met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS (post-COVID ME/CFS, pcMECFS). Pre-pandemic seronegative healthy controls (ppHC, n = 32) and post-COVID recovered healthy controls (pcHC, n = 37) after SARS-CoV-2 infection were also included in the study. We found persistent serum SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a subset of pcHC (11 %), PCS non-ME/CFS patients (2 %), and pcMECFS patients (14 %). There was no significant association with disease severity, symptoms, or laboratory markers. The spike protein concentration was independent of the time since last spike exposure (infection or vaccination). In five spike-positive out of a total of 22 patients who underwent immunoglobulin depletion via immunoadsorption (IA), spike protein was reduced or completely removed after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins. In summary, our study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection without evidence for a role in the pathogenesis of PCS.">

        <tr id="Basal ganglia disease has been reported as a post-infection sequela of several viruses, with documentation of this phenomenon from the H1N1 Spanish flu to the recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.">

How formation of specifically long-lived plasma cells is regulated via the interplay between specific B and CD4+ T cells is not well understood. Generally, antibody levels decline over time after clearance of the primary infection.In this study, convalescent individuals with stable RBD antibody levels (n=14, “sustainers”) were compared with donors (n=13) with the greatest antibody decline from a cohort of 132. To investigate the role of the cellular immune compartment in the maintenance of antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific responses at 4 to 6 weeks post-mild COVID-19 infection were characterized using deep immune profiling.Both groups had similar frequencies of total SARS-CoV-2-specific B and CD4+ T cells. Sustainers had fewer Spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells early after infection and increased neutralizing capacity of RBD antibodies over time, unlike the declining group. However, declining IgG titers correlated with lower frequency of Spike-specific CD4+ T cells.These data suggest that “sustainers” have unique dynamics of GC reactions, yield different outputs of terminally differentiating cells, and improve the quality of protective antibodies over time. This study helps identify factors controlling formation of long-lived PC and sustained antibody responses.">

Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid.

One area of increasing interest is the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the complement system, a crucial component of innate immunity. This review explores the intricate relationship between COVID-19 and the complement system, shedding light on how the virus exploits and manipulates the complement components to induce inflammatory responses leading to coagulopathies. The activation of the complement pathway simultaneously activates the coagulation cascade due to the presence of common substrates of mannan-binding serine proteases of the lectin complement system in the coagulation pathway. This cross-talk between the components of the complement and coagulation system further aggravates the dysregulation of immune responses, contributing to the cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 cases. A comprehensive understanding of this crosstalk is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe disease. Understandings into the molecular mechanisms governing this interaction may pave the way for the development of novel antiviral diagnostics and therapies based on immunomodulatory interventions, offering better management for such cases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly impacted global health, affecting not only the immediate morbidity and mortality rates but also long-term health outcomes across various populations. Although the acute effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system have initially been the primary focus, it is increasingly evident that the virus can have significant impacts on multiple physiological systems, including the nervous and immune systems. The pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between viral infection, immune aging, and brain health, that can potentially accelerate neuroimmune aging and contribute to the persistence of long COVID conditions. By inducing chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and neuroinflammation, COVID-19 may exacerbate the processes of neuroimmune aging, leading to increased risks of cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases, and impaired immune function. Key factors include chronic immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the disruption of cellular processes. These overlapping mechanisms between aging and COVID-19 illustrate how the virus can induce and accelerate aging-related processes, leading to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases and other age-related conditions. This mini-review examines key features and possible mechanisms of COVID-19-induced neuroimmune aging that may contribute to the persistence and severity of long COVID. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective interventions. Anti-inflammatory therapies, neuroprotective agents, immunomodulatory treatments, and lifestyle interventions all hold potential for mitigating the long-term effects of the virus. By addressing these challenges, we can improve health outcomes and quality of life for millions affected by the pandemic.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19. The development of antiviral drugs for COVID-19 has been hampered by the requirement of a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory for experiments related to SARS-CoV-2, and by the lack of easy and precise methods for quantification of infection. Here, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 viral vector composed of all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins constitutively expressed in lentivirally transduced cells, combined with an RNA replicon deleted for SARS-CoV-2 structural protein genes S, M and E, and expressing a luciferase-GFP fusion protein. We show that, after concentrating viral stocks by ultracentrifugation, the SARS-CoV-2 viral vector is able to infect two human cell lines expressing receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Both luciferase activity and GFP fluorescence were detected, and transduction was remdesivir-sensitive. We also show that this vector is inhibited by three type I interferons (IFN-I) subtypes. Although improvements are needed to increase infectious titers, this vector system may prove useful for antiviral drug screening and SARS-CoV-2-related investigations.">

 Introduction:
 The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has significantly impacted global health. SARS-CoV-2 features an RNA genome and four structural proteins: spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Despite the decline in severe COVID-19 cases, patients with hematological malignancies remain at a heightened risk for hospitalization. Hence, novel therapeutic strategies are essential for treating COVID-19 in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, is vital for blood coagulation, bone health, antioxidative activities, and immune regulation. It exists primarily in two forms: VK1 (phylloquinone) and VK2 (menaquinone). VK2 is particularly significant for bone and cardiovascular health and may offer therapeutic benefits in this context.
 Materials and Method:
 The study investigated the potential of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to induce cell death in CML cells and examined if VK2 could inhibit this effect. Furthermore, it explored whether VK2 could enhance the efficacy of ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in treating CML cells, including those resistant to ABL TKI therapy.
 Results:
 Gene expression profiles from CML patients were analyzed using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, with focus on biological processes related to immune response and SARS-CoV-2 signaling pathways. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the data from CML patients indicated that immune effector response and vascular development were significantly enriched biological processes (GSE100026). The SARS-CoV-2 signaling pathway (WP5115) played notable roles in these immune effector responses. In severe COVID-19 cases, there was a significant increase in the gene expression of IL-1a, IL-1b, and IL-6 compared to healthy controls (GSE227341). Due to the respiratory and immune-mediated effects of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, the CML cell line K562 was treated with an exogenous addition of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Treatment of K562 cells with the SARS-CoV-2 E protein led to a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation, heightened cytotoxicity, and increased caspase 3/7 activity. Cell death in K562 cells began within two hours. The apoptotic cell count rose due to the SARS-CoV-2 E protein, while the S1 protein did not trigger similar effects, suggesting that the E protein primarily causes cytotoxicity in CML cells. VK2 treatment protected CML cells from the damage caused by the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Our results showed that VK2 significantly reduced the levels of IL-1a, IL-1b, and IL-6. Additionally, VK2 suppressed the growth of both K562 and ponatinib-resistant K562 (K562 PR) cells in a dose-responsive manner, enhanced cytotoxicity, and diminished colony formation. When used with imatinib, VK2 further inhibited cell proliferation, raised caspase 3/7 activity, and led to increased cytotoxicity in both K562 and K562 PR cells, and diminished colony formation. Co-treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMP), indicating impaired mitochondrial function and reduced cellular viability.
 Conclusion:
 The research shows that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein triggers cell death in CML cells, and VK2 effectively mitigates this harm. In addition, VK2 boosts the efficacy of imatinib against CML cells, even those resistant to ABL TKI therapy. These results indicate that VK2 may be a potential treatment option for CML patients, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it provides both protective and therapeutic advantages.

        <tr id="The persistence or emergence of long-term symptoms following resolution of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). PASC predominantly affects the cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune systems. Among these, the central nervous system (CNS) is significantly impacted, leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, brain fog, cognitive impairment, anosmia, hypogeusia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy (neuro-PASC). However, the risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms responsible for neuro-PASC remain unclear. This review hypothesis discusses the leading hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in long COVID/PASC, focusing on neuro-PASC. We propose vascular dysfunction mediated by activation of astrocytes and pericytes followed by blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological manifestations. Additionally, we provide insights into the role of spike protein at the blood–brain interface. Finally, we explore the potential pathogenic mechanisms initiated by the interaction between the spike protein and cellular receptors at the brain endothelial and tissue levels.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by virus-infected cells have the potential to encapsulate viral peptides, a characteristic that could facilitate vaccine development. Furthermore, plasma-derived EVs may elucidate pathological changes occurring in distal tissues during viral infections. We hypothesized that molecular characterization of EVs isolated from COVID-19 patients would reveal peptides suitable for vaccine development. Blood samples were collected from three cohorts: severe COVID-19 patients (G1), mild/asymptomatic cases (G2), and SARS-CoV-2-negative healthcare workers (G3). Samples were obtained at two time points: during the initial phase of the pandemic in early 2020 (m0) and eight months later (m8). Clinical data analysis revealed elevated inflammatory markers in G1. Notably, non-vaccinated individuals in G1 exhibited increased levels of neutralizing antibodies at m8, suggesting prolonged exposure to viral antigens. Proteomic profiling of EVs was performed using three distinct methods: immunocapture (targeting CD9), ganglioside-capture (utilizing Siglec-1) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Contrary to our hypothesis, this analysis failed to identify viral peptides. These findings were subsequently validated through Western blot analysis targeting the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein’s and comparative studies using samples from experimentally infected Syrian hamsters. Furthermore, analysis of the EV cargo revealed a diverse molecular profile, including components involved in the regulation of viral replication, systemic inflammation, antigen presentation, and stress responses. These findings underscore the potential significance of EVs in the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes the extremely infectious sickness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Globally, COVID-19 (simply, COVID) has had a terrible impact, killing more than 6 million people. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly around the globe since the first instance of this respiratory viral infection was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on 31 December 2019. Keeping given epidemiological estimates, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Post-COVID is a clinical condition characterized by the development of totally new COVID-19 symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-affected patients have been reporting a range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities which include myocardial inflammation, myocardial infarction, right ventricular dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, coronary artery atherosclerosis, focal myocardial fibrosis, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, viral myocarditis, postural orthostatic tachycardia symptom (POTS), aortic and arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, and arrhythmias. Cardiopulmonary symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, hypotension, and POTS are common and associated with significant disability and heightened anxiety. Additionally, the risk of CV side effects has also been reported with currently available COVID-19 vaccines. Pathophysiological mechanisms for post-COVID cardiac complications are still poorly understood. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiac diseases which are abundant in those at risk of severe disease. This review discusses the definition of post-COVID complications, pathophysiological mechanisms of underlying acute and chronic CV injury, and their impact post-COVID-19 on multiorgan health.

However, it is unclear whether anti-IFN-α autoantibodies in the airways, the initial site of infection, can also determine disease outcomes. In this study, we developed a multiparameter technology, FlowBEAT, to quantify and profile the isotypes of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and anti-IFN-α antibodies in longitudinal samples collected over 20 months from the airways and blood of 129 donors spanning mild to severe COVID-19. We found that nasal IgA1 anti-IFN-α autoantibodies were induced after infection onset in more than 70% of mild and moderate COVID-19 cases and were associated with robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, fewer symptoms, and efficient recovery. Nasal anti-IFN-α autoantibodies followed the peak of host IFN-α production and waned with disease recovery, revealing a regulated balance between IFN-α and anti-IFN-α response. In contrast, systemic IgG1 anti-IFN-α autoantibodies appeared later and were detected only in a subset of patients with elevated systemic inflammation and worsening symptoms. These data reveal a protective role for nasal anti-IFN-α in the immunopathology of COVID-19 and suggest that anti-IFN-α autoantibodies may serve a homeostatic function to regulate host IFN-α after viral infection in the respiratory mucosa.">

        <tr id="As of early October 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, resulted in approximately 35 million cases and one million fatalities worldwide. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease marked by the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies and a lack of tolerance to nuclear self-antigens. Hypocomple-mentemia, or an abnormal blood complement deficit, is a reliable predictor of infection in SLE patients. Moreover, it has been found that immunoglobulin (Ig), particularly IgG and IgM, is lowered in SLE patients, which may be a factor in their heightened susceptibility to infection. Bloodstream autoantibodies, lymphopenia, aberrant T cells, proinflammatory cytokines, and impaired regulatory systems all lead to an immune response that is aberrant in lupus patients. SLE patients exhibit impaired CD8 T cell responses, including abnormal phagocytosis and chemotaxis. Recent study has shown that COVID-19 infections significantly boost type I inter-feron responses. Patients with SLE and Covid-19 infection typically get immune-suppressing drugs viz corticosteroids, Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK), and tocilizumab, which improve their immune systems and diminution susceptible to Covid-19 infections.">

        <tr id="Introduction Dysregulated host cytokine responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are a primary cause of progression to severe disease, whereas early neutralizing antibody responses are considered protective. However, there are gaps in understanding the early temporal dynamics of these immune responses, and the profile of productive immune responses generated by non-hospitalized people with mild infections in the community. Methods Here we conducted a prospective cohort study of people with suspected infections/exposures in the US state of North Carolina, before vaccine availability. We recruited participants not only in hospitals/clinics, but also in their homes. With serial sampling, we compared virologic and immunologic factors in 258 community cases versus 114 hospital cases of COVID-19 to define factors associated with severity. Results We found that high early neutralizing antibodies were associated with lower nasal viral load, but not protection from hospitalization. Cytokine responses were evaluated in 125 cases, with subsets at first versus second week of illness to assess for time-dependent trajectories. The hospital group demonstrated a higher magnitude of serum IL-6, IL-1R antagonist, IP-10, and MIG; prolonged upregulation of IL-17; and lesser downregulation of GROα, IL-1R antagonist, and MCP1, in comparison to the community group suggesting that these factors may contribute to immunopathology. In the second week of illness, 2-fold increases in IL-6, IL-1R antagonist, and IP-10 were associated with 2.2, 1.8, and 10-fold higher odds of hospitalization respectively, whereas a 2-fold increase in IL-10 was associated with 63% reduction in odds of hospitalization (p<0.05). Moreover, antibody responses at 3-6 months post mild SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community revealed long-lasting antiviral IgM and IgA antibodies as well as a stable set point of neutralizing antibodies that were not waning. Discussion Our data provide valuable temporal cytokine benchmarks to track the progression of immunopathology in COVID-19 patients and guide improvements in immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Genome-wide association studies performed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have uncovered various loci significantly associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity. However, the underlying cis-regulatory genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their impact on clinical phenotypes remain enigmatic. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underscore the importance of expanding the study of regulatory variation to relevant cell types and disease contexts and argue for the existence of extensive gene-environment effects among patients responding to an infection.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 (LC) is a poorly understood, multifactorial condition that persists for at least three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the wide range of associated symptoms—including fatigue, brain fog, and respiratory issues—remain unclear. However, emerging evidence suggests that the reactivation of latent viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus, may significantly contribute to the complexity of LC. These latent viruses can be reactivated by SARS-CoV-2, contributing to a chronic inflammatory state that prolongs symptomatology. This review confirms the potential involvement of latent viral infections in LC and examines whether these infections play an independent role or act synergistically with other factors. In addition, recent studies have highlighted viral persistence and immune dysregulation as key elements in LC. Our findings suggest that preventative strategies, including vaccination and antiviral treatments during the acute phase of COVID-19, show potential in reducing LC risk by preventing viral reactivation. However, tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting these latent infections are urgently needed. Identifying biomarkers of viral reactivation, particularly for high-risk populations, could be considered another effective strategy to mitigate LC severity. Further research is crucial to better understand the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and latent infections, and to improve the prevention and treatment of LC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and risk of long COVID has been associated with the depletion or over-abundance of specific taxa within the gut microbiome. However, the microbial mechanisms mediating these effects are not yet known. We hypothesized that altered microbial production of tryptophan and its downstream derivatives might contribute to inappropriate immune responses to viral infection. In patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 172), serum levels of tryptophan and indole-3-propionate (IPA) negatively correlated with serum levels of many proinflammatory mediators (including C-reactive protein and Serum amyloid A), while C-glycosyltryptophan (C-Trp), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were positively correlated with levels of acute phase proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, alarmins and chemokines. A similar pattern was observed in long COVID patients (n = 20) where tryptophan and IPA were negatively associated with a large number of serum cytokines, while C-Trp and IAA were positively associated with circulating cytokine levels. Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota showed the relative abundance of genes encoding the microbial enzymes required for tryptophan production (e.g. anthranilate synthase) and microbial tryptophan metabolism was significantly lower in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 380) compared to healthy controls (n = 270). Microbial tryptophan metabolites reduced innate cell proinflammatory responses to cytosolic DNA sensor Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 and TLR-4 stimulation in vitro, while IL-10 secretion was enhanced. Microbial tryptophan metabolites also modified ex vivo human lymphocyte responses by limiting the production of TH1 and TH17 associated cytokines, while enhancing secretion of IL-22. These data suggest that lower levels of tryptophan production and tryptophan metabolism by gut microbes may increase the risk of severe and chronic outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to impaired innate and adaptive responses to infection. Screening patients for lower-level microbiome capacity for tryptophan metabolism may help identify at-risk individuals.">

An abnormal maternal Th1-type response to pregnancy may be the basis for pathogenesis of CIUE but macrophage in the maternal infiltrate of CIUE have been reported to have an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype characterized by increased expression of CD163. This study assesses expression of CD163 in CIUE and SARS-CoV-2 placentitis, which has a similar histopathological presentation, using an automated approach to minimize observer-related variability. The data show that the maternal inflammatory infiltrate of CIUE contains a blended population of high and low CD163 expressing macrophage with a prominent bias towards an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype when compared to normal control tissue. A similar pattern is seen in SARS-CoV-2 placentitis, suggesting pathophysiologic similarity with CIUE, although SARS-CoV-2 also appears to promote decreased CD163 expression in Hofbauer cells, which is not seen in CIUE.">

Here we performed single-cell sequencing of microglia and monocytes from 6-month-old WT and 5xFAD mice subjected to one dose of LPS (1mg/kg) at postnatal day 9. We successfully mapped disease-associated microglia (DAM) and perivascular macrophages in our data and demonstrated a subpopulation of microglia that adopted a monocyte-like profile, marked by Lyz2, Tmsb10, Lgals1and Lgals3. This unique subset appeared in response to early systemic LPS challenge and AD pathology but diminished in the presence of double stimulus. Different cytokines were altered in the brain and periphery as seen using mesoscale plates. GM-CSF and MIP-1α levels were altered in an amyloid-β(Aβ)-dependent manner in hippocampus. MIP-1β and IFN-γ were altered upon early LPS stimulation. In the periphery, we found MMP-9 was significantly increased in serum samples from 5xFAD mice. Interestingly, early LPS stimulation significantly elevated TNF-α in serum from WT and 5xFAD mice, but was reduced in the hippocampus due to Aβ pathology. The LPS treatment in 5xFAD mice had a tendency to improve the short-term memory deficit. Taken together, we observed long-lasting effects from early life stress, including activation of inflammation in the periphery and brain through modulation of different signaling cascades.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a significant global public health challenge. While respiratory symptoms dominate, the virus's impact on other systems, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), has gained increasing attention. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates tropism for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, expressed in the olfactory epithelium, lungs, endothelium, kidneys, enterocytes, and neurons, contributing to neurological manifestations observed during the acute phase of the disease.  
Materials and Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. Keywords included: COVID-19, Post Acute COVID-19 Syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 Virus, Neurological Manifestations, and Central Nervous System Viral Diseases. A total of 58 articles were selected for analysis based on relevance and quality of evidence regarding neurological symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19.  
Basic Results: The acute phase of COVID-19 frequently involves neurological symptoms such as frontal and holocranial headaches, dizziness, gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, and alterations in consciousness. Severe complications, though less common, include encephalitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and myelitis. These conditions often present as altered mental status, seizures, aphasia, headaches, or focal deficits, contributing substantially to patient morbidity and mortality.  
Conclusions: Neurological symptoms and complications constitute a significant aspect of COVID-19, highlighting the virus's potential to affect the CNS. While severe complications are rare, their profound impact on prognosis underscores the importance of early recognition and management. Further research is essential to understand the pathophysiology and optimise therapeutic approaches for affected patients. ">

Here, we take advantage of a detailed dataset from a human challenge study to fit dynamic models that include innate and adaptive immune responses to longitudinal changes in both infectious and total virus. We uncovered a nonlinear relationship between total virus and infectious virus. We found that viral replication, after a short delay, is rapid, with a doubling time of ~2 h for viral RNA and ~3 h for infectious virus. We also found that innate immunity wanes as virus is brought under control, which together with adaptive immunity, initiated ~7 to 10 d postinfection, contributes to a multiphasic viral decline experienced by some participants.">

        <tr id="Aberrant and sustained activation of microglia is implicated in the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether intrinsic alterations in microglial function impact the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. We conducted transcriptomic and functional analyses of microglia-like cells (iMGLs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MS (pwMS) to answer this question. We generated iPSCs from six pwMS showing increased microglial activity via translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging. We demonstrated that the differentiated iMGL transcriptional profile resembled the microglial signature found in MS lesions. Importantly, compared with healthy controls, MS iMGLs presented cell-autonomous differences in their regulation of inflammation, both in the basal state and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide challenge. Through transcriptomic profiling, we showed that MS iMGLs display increased expression of genes known to be upregulated in MS microglia. Furthermore, upregulated genes in MS iMGLs were associated with immune receptor activation, antigen presentation, and the complement system, with known MS implications. Finally, functional analyses indicated that the transcriptional changes in MS iMGLs corresponded with alterations in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased phagocytosis. Together, our results provide evidence of putative cell-autonomous microglial activation in pwMS and identify transcriptomic and functional changes that recapitulate the phenotypes observed in vivo in microglia from pwMS. These findings indicate that MS disease-specific iPSCs are valuable tools for studying disease-specific microglial activation in vitro and highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets in MS.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a significant threat to global public health. Immunopathological damage plays a role in driving pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure in severe COVID-19. Therefore, dissecting the pulmonary immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to understand disease pathogenesis and identify immune pathways targetable by therapeutic intervention. Considering that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 enhances COVID-19 disease severity, therapeutic targeting of upstream signals that drive type 2 immunity may confer further protection. In this study, we investigate the role of the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis, a potent inducer of type 2 immunity in the lung, in a mouse model of COVID-19. Upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10, ST2-/- mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (69.2% vs 13.3% survival; P = 0.0005), as compared to wild-type mice. In a complementary pharmacologic approach, IL-33/ST2 signaling was inhibited using HpBARI_Hom2, a helminth derived protein that binds to mouse ST2 and blocks IL-33 signaling. In SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (60% vs 10% survival; P = 0.0035), as compared to inert control-treated mice. These data demonstrate that loss of IL-33/ST2 signaling confers protection during acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, implicating the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis as an enhancer of COVID-19 disease severity. The protection conferred by pharmacologic blockade of IL-33/ST2 signaling was independent of viral control, as HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had no reduction in viral titers. This finding suggests an immunopathogenic role for IL-33/ST2 signaling. One potential mechanism through which IL-33/ST2 signaling may drive severe disease is through enhancement of type 2 immune pathways including IL-5 production, as pulmonary IL-5 concentrations were found to depend on IL-33/ST2 signaling in acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection.">

 The sheer number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the development of a debilitating post-acute condition named post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also known as Long COVID. Symptoms of PASC can last for months to years after the initial infection and are multifaceted, including fatigue, exertional malaise, and a collection of cognitive impairments (e.g., brain fog). Conservative estimates suggest PASC occurs in ~10% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. PASC is associated with hypercoagulability and persistent endotheliopathy, and several studies reported increased risks for cardiovascular disease and thrombosis up to 1 year after infection. The mechanisms responsible for PASC remain unclear. Numerous hypotheses are proposed, including chronic inflammation due to persistent viral reservoirs, development of autoimmunity, and immune-mediated tissue damage resulting from continuing complement activation and/or non-resolving anti-viral responses. This indicates the urgent need for new models to test these hypotheses and to understand the pathogenesis of PASC and PASC-associated thrombosis.
 We developed a mouse model of Long-COVID based on the widely used K18-hACE2 (K18) transgenic mouse. Infection with a low viral dose of 2.5 x 103 f.f.u. of SARS-CoV-2 (USA WA1/2020) prolonged the acute symptomatic phase recapitulating many of the COVID-19-Associated Coagulopathy (CAC) findings observed in human patients, including hypercoagulability, increased plasma concentration of D-Dimers, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and VWF. Surviving mice recovered their initial body weight two weeks post-infection and did not display signs of overt disease for their remaining lifetime.
 Histological analysis of surviving mice revealed the presence of long-lasting inflammatory foci scattered around the lungs' parenchyma, persisting up to 14 months post-infection, suggesting the existence of an enduring inflammatory stimulus of unknown origin leading to a state of chronic inflammation. Persistent endotheliopathy was evident from elevated levels of circulating sTM, sEPCR, sP-Selectin, and elevated levels of VWF in plasma lasting for at least 5 months post-infection.
 At 70 days post-infection K18 survivors developed significantly larger thrombi 24 hours after stenosis of the vena cava compared to infected wild-type (WT) littermate controls who developed minimal disease during the acute infection. The average thrombus size in K18 survivors was in between that of uninfected factor V Leiden heterozygous and homozygous mice, suggesting the thrombotic risk of K18 survivors might be somewhere in between as well. At 5 months post-infection, K18 survivors showed a complete and sustained occlusion in a carotid artery thrombosis model induced by a low dose of ferric chloride, whereas no stable occlusion was observed in infected WT littermate controls, suggesting a persistently increased susceptibility for thrombosis.
 To evaluate the occurrence of cognitive abnormalities comparable to those described in individuals with PASC, K18 survivors and infected WT littermate controls were challenged using a battery of behavioral tests 5 months post-infection. In an open field test, K18 survivors showed reduced exploratory drive and total distance traveled compared to controls, suggesting impaired locomotive activity and increased anxiety. Cognitive impairments of K18 survivors were exacerbated after physical or emotional stress. In a novel object recognition test preceded by 20 minutes treadmill running, K18 survivors spent significantly less time exploring the newly introduced object compared to infected WT littermate controls. Similarly, in a light/dark transfer test, a 30 minutes physical restraint, eliciting a corticosterone-mediated stress response, significantly reduced transitions from darkness to light in K18 survivors when compared to infected WT littermate controls. Thus, K18 survivors displayed a significant increase in stress and anxiety responses that are indicative of cognitive impairments that were not observed in infected WT littermate controls.
 In summary, our Long COVID mouse model replicates key aspects of PASC in humans and provides a unique opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms contributing to PASC and to evaluate potential new therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Monocytes are essential for replenishing homeostatic macrophages in the intestine. However, they also accumulate in significant numbers when intestinal homeostasis is disrupted in diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The molecular pathways governing monocyte behaviour across these different contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of monocytes that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs). These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate increased expression of IBD susceptibility genes. By performing cross-species analysis, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis in mice. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete precursor in the bone marrow (BM) and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans. Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production. Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health.">

However, the focus on immediate effects was assumed as the tip of iceberg due to the symptoms following acute infection, which was defined as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). Gut microbiota alterations even after disease resolution and the gastrointestinal symptoms are the key features of PACS. Gut microbiota and derived metabolites disorders may play a crucial role in inflammatory and immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection through the gut-lung axis. Diet is one of the modifiable factors closely related to gut microbiota and COVID-19. In this review, we described the reciprocal crosstalk between gut and lung, highlighting the participation of diet and gut microbiota in and after COVID-19 by destroying the gut barrier, perturbing the metabolism and regulating the immune system. Therefore, bolstering beneficial species by dietary supplements, probiotics or prebiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be a novel avenue for COVID-19 and PACS prevention. This review provides a better understanding of the association between gut microbiota and the long-term consequences of COVID-19, which indicates modulating gut dysbiosis may be a potentiality for addressing this multifaceted condition.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Understanding how RNA viral load changes (viral load kinetics) during acute infection in SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify when and which patients are most infectious. We seek to summarise existing data on the longitudinal RNA viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 sampled from different parts of the respiratory tract (nose, nasopharynx, oropharynx, saliva and exhaled breath) and how this may vary with age, sex, ethnicity, immune status, disease severity, vaccination, treatment and virus variant. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis, using studies identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE (via Ovid). All research studies reporting primary data on longitudinal RNA viral load kinetics of infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 will be included. Methodological quality will be assessed using a validated checklist for longitudinal studies as well as predefined quality criteria for assessment of individual-level RNA viral load. Should the data allow, we will aim to perform individual patient-level meta-analysis. Our primary outcomes are duration to, and quantity of peak RNA viral load, and total duration of viral load shedding within different respiratory compartments. Secondary outcomes include duration of lateral flow antigen and virus culture positivity and variation of RNA viral load by age, immune status, disease severity, vaccination, treatment, lateral flow tests, viral culture positivity and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Study-level effects affecting observations, but not related to properties of the patient, such as the PCR platform and gene target will also be recorded. Random-effects models will estimate the population mean and individual-level variation in viral shedding conditional on the aforementioned variables. Finally, we will summarise the key mechanistic models used in the literature to reconstruct individual-level viral kinetics and estimate how different factors shape viral dynamics over time. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not needed as data will be obtained from published articles or studies with data that have already received and ethical review for analysis.

        <tr id=". Literature data on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection in people with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (RD) are contradictory. According to most studies, the risk of infection and development of severe forms of COVID-19 is higher in patients with RD compared to the general population, but largely depends on the type and activity of RD. Patients with severe RD most often required mechanical ventilation and died more often. This is due to immune dysfunction caused by both the disease itself and antirheumatic therapy using immunomodulatory drugs. The state of immunosuppression, additional comorbid chronic diseases and incomplete vaccination are factors in the need for hospitalization, intensive care, the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes and reinfection with coronavirus in patients with RD. They retained their significance during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Although there is no complete consensus in the literature regarding the association between the presence of rheumatic diseases and the severity of COVID-19, in general, rheumatic diseases are not considered to be a factor that increases the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the antibody response and reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19. However, people with rheumatic diseases have reduced or absent antibody production in response to even full vaccination and higher rates of breakthrough infection after vaccination. Further research on specific rheumatic diseases and the use of antirheumatic drugs in the context of COVID-19 is needed to reduce the severity of COVID-19 in this population.">

Data regarding functional roles of human T cells in SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) viral clearance in primary COVID-19 are limited. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed samples for associations between SARS2 upper respiratory tract viral RNA levels and early virus-specific adaptive immune responses for 95 unvaccinated clinical trial participants with acute primary COVID-19 aged 18–86 years old, approximately half of whom were considered at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Functionality and magnitude of acute SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated, in addition to antibody responses. Most individuals with acute COVID-19 developed SARS2-specific T cell responses within 6 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Early CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were polyfunctional, and both strongly associated with reduced upper respiratory tract SARS2 viral RNA, independent of neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, these findings provide evidence for protective roles for circulating SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during acute COVID-19.">

This review was carried out from the perspective of immunological and pathological changes affecting epidemiological features of the disease during progression and therapy. COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system but may also affect cardiovascular and neurological systems, manifesting various symptoms from fever and cough to such severe complications as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and organ failure. Patterns in immune responses involving decreases in peripheral T cells and natural killer cells have been recognized as being part of a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Finally, it discusses the dynamic of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including droplet mode spread and possible fecal-oral pathway. The virus's structural and pathological attributes are emphasized, complemented by a historical overview that chronicles its transformation from a non-threatening variant to a worldwide hazard. Various management approaches, encompassing traditional Indian medicinal practices and immune-enhancing measures such as zinc, iron, magnesium, vitamins, and herbal treatments, are assessed regarding their effectiveness in bolstering immunity and facilitating recovery. Additionally, lifestyle habits such as physical activity, sufficient rest, and proper hydration contribute to the maintenance of immune health.

        <tr id="Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and long-term complications in bone health. Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces bone turnover and promotes bone loss, but the mechanism underlying worsened bone health remains elusive. This study sought to identify specific immune mediators that exacerbated preexisting IMIDs after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Plasma samples from 4 groups were analyzed: healthy, IMID only, COVID-19 only, and COVID-19 + IMID. Using high-throughput multiplexed proteomics, we profiled 1,500 protein biomarkers and identified 148 unique biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with IMIDs, including elevated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17F) and bone resorption markers. Long-term circulating SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, a virulence factor for COVID-19, was detected in the COVID + IMID group. RA was one of the most common IMIDs in our study. ORF8 treatment of RA-derived human osteoblasts (RA-hOBs) increased levels of inflammatory (TNF, IL6, CCL2) and bone resorption (RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio) markers compared with healthy controls. Supernatants from ORF8-treated RA-hOBs drove the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast-like cells. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exposure can exacerbate IMIDs through ORF8-driven inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19–induced bone pathologies.">

        <tr id="Concerns about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (COVID-19) continue to persist even years later, with the emergence of new variants and the risk of disease severity. Common clinical symptoms, like cough, fever, and respiratory symptoms, characterize the noncritical patients, classifying them from mild to moderate. In a more severe and complex scenario, the virus infection can affect vital organs, resulting, for instance, in pneumonia and impaired kidney and heart function. However, it is well-known that subclinical symptoms at a metabolic level can be observed previously but require a proper diagnosis because viral replication on the host leaves a track with a different profile depending on the severity of the illness. Metabolomic profiles of mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 patients were obtained by multiple platforms (LC-HRMS and MALDI-MS), increasing the chance to elucidate a prognosis for severity risk. A strong link was discovered between phenylalanine metabolism and increased COVID-19 severity symptoms, a pathway linked to cardiac and neurological consequences. Glycerophospholipids and sphingolipid metabolisms were also dysregulated linearly with the increasing symptom severity, which can be related to virus proliferation, immune system avoidance, and apoptosis escaping. Our data, endorsed by other literature, strengthens the notion that these pathways might play a vital role in a patient’s prognosis.">

However, the genetic and epigenetic changes influencing the immune response on host infected cells remain unclear. Here, this study analyzes HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) during early infection (<6 months) using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing. It is observed that HIV-1 hinders the antiviral response, particularly by interfering with the interferon signalling pathway. Multimodal analysis identifies KLF2 as a key transcription factor in infected CD4+ T cells. Moreover, cells harbouring HIV-1 provirus are predominantly identified as Th17 cells, which exhibit elevated KLF2 activity. This suggests an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and a constrained immune response due to the quiescent characteristics of these cells. The finding provides insights into the immune mechanisms and key regulators of HIV-1 maintenance in CD4+ T cells during the early stages of infection.">

        <tr id="Advanced age increases the risk of severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as incidence of long COVID and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We hypothesized that perturbations in the aged antiviral CD8+ T cell response predisposes elderly individuals to severe coronavirus infection, re-infection, and postinfectious cognitive sequelae. Using MHV-A59 as a murine model of respiratory coronavirus, we found that aging increased CNS infection and lethality to MHV infection. This was coupled with increased CD8+ T cells within the aged CNS but reduced antigen specificity. Aged animals also displayed a decreased proportion of CD103+ resident memory cells (TRM), which correlated with increased severity of secondary viral challenge. Using a reciprocal adoptive transfer paradigm, data show that not only were fewer aged CD8+ T cells retained within the adult brain post-infection, but also that adult CD8+ cells expressed lower levels of TRM marker CD103 when in the aged microenvironment. Furthermore, aged animals demonstrated spatial learning impairment following MHV infection, which worsened in both aged and adult animals following secondary viral challenge. Spatial learning impairment was accompanied by increased TUNEL positivity in hippocampal neurons, suggestive of neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, primary cell coculture showed that activated CD8+ T cells induced TUNEL positivity in neurons, independent of antigen-specificity. Altogether, these results show that non-antigen specific CD8+ T cells are recruited to the aged brain and cause broad neuronal death without establishing a TRM phenotype that confers lasting protection against a secondary infection.">

We monitored the changes in serum indexes such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL), OxLDL/LDL-C ratio, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in patients with different clinical types. Results: 48 non-severe patients, 90 severe patients, and 49 critically ill patients were enrolled. Compared with the non-severe group, OxLDL level and OxLDL/LDL-C ratio were increased in severe COVID-19 patients and critically ill COVID-19 patients, while 3-NT and TXB2 concentrations were lower in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Critically ill COVID-19 patients also exhibited lower concentrations of Lp-PLA2 and a higher OxLDL/LDL-C ratio compared to severe COVID-19 patients. No significant differences were observed in AOPP and 8-OHdG concentrations. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that CRP was associated with OxLDL, OxLDL/LDL-C ratio, AOPP, 3-NT, TXB2, and Lp-PLA2 (P <0.05). OxLDL was identified as an independent risk factor for progression from non-severe to severe/critically ill COVID-19. OxLDL and OxLDL/LDL-C ratio demonstrated good discriminatory value between non-severe and severe/critically ill COVID-19, with the OxLDL/LDL-C ratio also distinguishing between severe and critically ill patients. Conclusion: Patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19 exhibit elevated levels of oxidative damage to lipoproteins. OxLDL and the OxLDL/LDL-C ratio can serve as biomarkers for assessing disease severity in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Although the risk of emerging coronavirus infection may seem to have disappeared at first glance, SARS-COV-2 has complex and poorly understood effects on many organ systems, including the nervous system. Disease progression and unfavorable outcome COVID-19 are not only due to lung damage, elderly age, concomitant pathology: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc. have a significant impact.Aim. To study the structure of mortality in a new coronavirus infection COVID-19, caused by delta strain of coronavirus SARS- CoV-2, taking into account the nature of concomitant therapeutic and neurological pathology, the degree of comorbidity, fatal complications, and sex and age characteristics.Materials and methods. A postmortem analysis of pathological and anatomical conclusions of 209 patients with COVID-19 with comorbid somatic and neurological pathology who received inpatient treatment in covid hospitals of the Republic of Mordovia in 2021 was performed. The severity of the underlying disease, concomitant therapeutic and neurological pathology, and comorbidity were analysed. The coincidence of the final clinical and pathological diagnoses, fatal complications were assessed. The presented data allowed to identify the main factors of unfavourable outcome.Results and discussion. In unfavourable outcome of the disease, concomitant pathology is represented by hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, chronic cerebral ischemia. In women, cases of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis were more frequent, in men - hypertension and chronic heart failure.Conclusions. New coronavirus COVID-19 infection associated with delta strain of SARS-COV-2 virus is characterised by severe and extremely severe course in elderly patients with comorbid somatic and neurological pathology.">

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, represents a significant and complex health challenge with a wide range of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the emerging evidence suggesting a critical role of the gut and gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of Long COVID. It explores how changes in the gut microbiome, disruption of gut barrier integrity, and the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens within the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to the prolonged and varied symptoms seen in Long COVID, including chronic inflammation and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The review also summarizes key insights gained about Long COVID, highlighting its multifactorial nature, which involves immune dysregulation, microvascular damage, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, with the gut playing a central role in these processes. While progress has been made in understanding these mechanisms, current evidence remains inconclusive. The challenges of establishing causality, standardizing research methodologies, and addressing individual variations in the microbiome are discussed, emphasizing the need for further longitudinal studies and more comprehensive approaches to enhance our understanding of these complex interactions. This review underscores the importance of personalized approaches in developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Long COVID, while also acknowledging the significant gaps in our current understanding. Future research should aim to further unravel the complex interplay between the gut and Long COVID, ultimately improving outcomes for those affected by this condition.">

        <tr id="In SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytokines and laboratory biomarkers play a key role in disease progression and their long-term levels have been associated with the outcome of long COVID-19.I) study the levels of cytokines, hematological and biochemical biomarkers in the acute and post-acute phases of COVID-19 disease; and II) assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccine doses on fatigue symptoms.This study is an exploratory cohort nested within a clinical and laboratory follow-up of surviving participants after pre-vaccine acute COVID-19 infection with severe clinical manifestations. We analyzed the inflammatory biomarker profiles of fifty SARS-Cov-2 negative healthy controls from before the COVID-19 pandemic, and eighty patients in the acute phase (Day 1, Day 7 and Day 14), and during 4 months and 2 years after hospitalization.Four months after hospitalization, 91.3% (73/80) of patients exhibited onset of long COVID symptoms, which persisted in 63.7% (51/80) after 2 years. Comparing the baseline values of the cytokines in the controls versus the follow-up times, the cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were high in the acute phase, declining over time after the individual’s recovery, while IL-1β showed an inverse variation, remaining high after 2 years. IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF increased over time post-acute infection, indicating a long-term inflammatory response. Vaccination with four doses, compared to three doses, showed a slight protective effect against fatigue symptoms in the male population (IRR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22 - 1.02; p=0.054). Neutrophil and leukocyte counts showed a significant reduction 2 years after hospitalization. However, platelet count was the laboratory biomarker that best reflects the prediction of long COVID symptoms up for to 2 years.Although the frequency of long COVID symptoms declines over time after the acute illness, symptoms continue to persist 2 years after hospital discharge. Vaccination with a fourth dose booster appears to significantly influence reduction of symptoms associated with long COVID fatigue among the males. We further identified important laboratory biomarkers for long COVID. Elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF, along with low levels of IL-6, IL-18, and IL-12p70, also offer new insights into the inflammatory state in long COVID.">

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the population unequally, with a greater impact on older and immunosuppressed people. Methods Hence, we performed a prospective experimental cohort study to characterise the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in immune-compromised patients (older adults and oncohaematologic patients), compared with healthy counterparts, based on deep characterisation of the circulating immune cell subsets. Results and discussion While acquired humoral and cellular memory did not predict subsequent infection 18 months after full vaccination, spectral and computational cytometry revealed several subsets within the CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and TEMRA Tγδ cells that were differentially expressed in individuals who were subsequently infected and not infected not just following immunisation, but also prior to vaccination. Of note, we found up to seven clusters within the TEMRA Tγδ cell population, with some of them being expanded and others decreased in subsequently infected individuals. Moreover, some of these cellular clusters were also related to COVID-19-induced hospitalisation in oncohaematologic patients. Therefore, we have identified a cellular signature that even before vaccination is related to COVID-19 vulnerability as opposed to the acquisition of cellular and/or humoral memory following vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.">

        <tr id="Sex differences have been observed in acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Long Covid (LC) outcomes, with greater disease severity and mortality during acute infection in males and greater proportions of females developing LC. We hypothesized that sex-specific immune dysregulation contributes to LC pathogenesis. To investigate the immunologic underpinnings of LC development and symptom persistence, we performed multiomic analyses on blood samples obtained during acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and 3 and 12 months after infection in a cohort of 45 participants who either developed LC or recovered. Several sex-specific immune pathways were associated with LC. Males who would later develop LC exhibited increases in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling during acute infection, whereas females who would go on to develop LC had reduced TGFB1 expression. Females who developed LC demonstrated increased expression of XIST, an RNA gene implicated in autoimmunity, during acute infection compared with females who recovered. Many immune features of LC were also conserved across sexes, such as alterations in monocyte phenotype and activation state. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors were up-regulated in many cell types at acute and convalescent time points. Those with ongoing LC demonstrated reduced ETS1 expression across lymphocyte subsets and elevated intracellular IL-4 in T cell subsets, suggesting that ETS1 alterations may drive aberrantly elevated T helper cell 2-like responses in LC. Altogether, this study describes multiple innate and adaptive immune correlates of LC, some of which differ by sex, and offers insights toward the pursuit of tailored therapeutics.">

COVID-19 has affected all aspects of modern society, from economic consequences to profound changes in healthcare systems and social structures. The rele­vance of studying the coronavirus infection is based on several important reasons. First, COVID-19 is characterized by its high transmission rate, leading to large outbreaks, which necessitates a detailed study of transmission methods and control measures. It should be noted that coronavirus infection affects various systems of the body, including the respi­ra­tory, cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems.

The immunological profiles of volunteers residing in endemic and non-endemic areas for chronic infectious diseases were analyzed at early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A unique signature of inflammatory plasma mediators was identified in COVID-19 volunteers when compared to individuals with other flu-like syndromes. COVID-19 severity correlated with high levels of inflammatory mediators; among them, CXCL9, a serum marker of aging. Patients who progressed to hospitalization displayed high frequencies of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing exhaustion and senescence markers and showed reduced and more mature B cell repertoires, which are typical of senescence. They also had an acceleration of epigenetic age measured by DNA methylation. Therefore, severe COVID-19 correlated with phenotypic, functional, and epigenetic features of accelerated immunosenescence at onset of infection.">

        <tr id="Microglia are non-electrogenic immune cells that respond rapidly to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from infections, injuries, or other forms of damage. Microglia mitochondria are essential for providing the requisite energy resources for immune regulation. While fluctuations in energy metabolism are regulated by mitochondria and are reflected in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), there remains a lack of innovation in microglia-centric tools that capitalize on this. In this study, live imaging of microglia in acute slices from EGFP reporter mice expressing EGFP under the control of the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) promoter is combined with loading a fluorescent reporter of ΔΨm. Depolarizations in the ΔΨm were recorded after administering the well-characterized immune stimulant lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia ΔΨm increased in distinctive phases with a relatively steep slope following LPS exposure. Conversely, the ΔΨm of neurons showed minimal regulation, highlighting a distinct microglia ΔΨm response to immune stimuli. Analysis of the depolarization of the microglia ΔΨm in the soma, branches, and endfeet revealed progressive changes in each subcellular domain originating in the soma and progressing outward. The inverse agonist emapunil attenuated the depolarization of the ΔΨm across states in a domain-specific manner. These findings emphasize the contribution of mitochondrial membrane dynamics in regulating microglial responses to immune stimuli. Further, this work advances a novel drug screening strategy for the therapeutic regulation of metabolic activity in inflammatory conditions of the brain.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The adaptive immune response plays a crucial role in resolution of viral infections; however, there is limited data on the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines like Sinopharm (Sin), Sputnik-V (SpV), and especially for the heterologous combination Sputnik-V/mRNA-1273 (Spv/Mod) scheme. Furthermore, emerging variants may compromise the adaptive immune response established in the population. Objective: To evaluate the T cell immune response induced by the Sin, SpV and SpV/Mod, against Wuhan, Gamma and Omicron viral variants. Methods: Serum levels of IgG antibodies were assessed by CMIA (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois). T cell responses against Wuhan, Gamma, and Omicron were evaluated through an activation-induced marker assay. Sixty individuals, evenly distributed across the Sin, SpV, and SpV/Mod groups, were included. Results: The median age of participants was 48 years (IQR: 34-56), with 58.3% (n=35) being female. Seventeen (28.3%) individuals had a prior confirmed COVID-19 infection. Spv/Mod scheme elicited significantly higher humoral responses (p<0.001). However, the three vaccination platforms showed consistent T cell responses across the different Wuhan, Gamma and Omicron stimuli tested. Particularly, all three schemes induced stronger CD8 responses against the Wuhan variant. In addition, more responders to Wuhan were observed in the Sin and Spv groups, while the Spv/Mod group showed a higher proportion of responders to Omicron. Conclusion: This study provides new data on effective humoral and cellular immune responses against Wuhan, Gamma, and Omicron variants. Moreover, memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses remain protective, and the heterologous scheme may elicit stronger T cell responses against emerging variants.">

        <tr id="Kounis syndrome, first described in 1991, refers to allergic or hypersensitive reactions that result in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this disease has enhanced our comprehension of viral infections, inflammatory reactions, and cardiovascular repercussions. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the occurrence of cardiac damage, arrhythmias, and thrombotic events that are associated to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby making the understanding of their development more complex. This research explores the complex correlation between Kounis syndrome and COVID-19, encompassing the phenomena of cytokine storms and endothelial dysfunction. Diagnosing Kounis syndrome in the context of COVID-19 presents challenges, nevertheless, it is imperative to distinguish it from other cardiovascular disorders. The identification of risk factors and predisposing situations that can exacerbate Kounis syndrome in COVID-19 patients is highlighted, with a particular focus on patient assessment. The care of Kounis syndrome in COVID-19 necessitates a multidisciplinary strategy that involves collaboration among cardiologists, allergists, and other specialists. Possible therapies encompass epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, cardiovascular interventions, as well as long-term surveillance and measures to reduce risk. Additional investigation should include epidemiological enquiries, experimental frameworks, and advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Comprehending the connection between viral infections and coronary syndromes caused by allergies is crucial for clinical practice and the well-being of patients. This review explores the neurobiological similarities and clinical implications of Kounis syndrome and COVID-19, aiming to enhance comprehension and treatment of this intricate clinical scenario.">

        <tr id="Acute lung injury (ALI), diagnosed clinically as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), refers to a spectrum of acute inflammatory processes culminating in increased permeability of the pulmonary alveolar–capillary barrier and impaired gas exchange. The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has raised questions as to the similarities and differences between COVID-19 lung injury and ALI of other etiologies. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of ALI and COVID-19 lung injury and draws comparisons between the latter and other infectious etiologies of ALI. Indeed, severe COVID-19 is characterized by a unique array of disease mechanisms including suppression of interferon responses, widespread inflammasome activation, altered leukocyte phenotypes, and hyperactive thrombotic activity. Moreover, these mechanisms manifest as a unique clinical progression, which further differentiates COVID-19 from other viral respiratory pathogens such as SARS, MERS, and influenza. These unique features of COVID-19 pathophysiology bear important implications for current and future therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and has been related to more than 7 million deaths globally since 2019. The association of high levels of IL‐6 with severe cases led to the early evaluation of the anti‐IL6 inhibitor tocilizumab as a potential treatment, which unfortunately failed to improve survival in many trials. Moreover, little is known about the development of COVID‐19 sequelae, and biomarkers are needed to understand and anticipate these processes. Because extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in viral infection and immune response, they could potentially serve as predictive and prognostic biomarkers. We isolated EVs from 39 patients with severe COVID‐19, from which 29 received tocilizumab and 10 were considered controls. Blood samples, which were collected at hospitalisation before treatment, at Day 7, and Day 15 during follow‐up, were assessed by immunoblot for longitudinal expression of spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Dynamic expression was calculated and compared with clinicopathological and experimental variables. Expression of EV S was validated by immunogold and imaging flow‐cytometry, revealing an enrichment in CD9+ EVs. As a result, decreasing expression of EV viral proteins was observed in patients treated with tocilizumab. Moreover, higher increase in EV S was observed in patients with lower antibody response, hyperfibrinogenemia, lower respiratory function, higher blood pressure and shorter outcomes. These findings lay the foundation for future studies characterizing the role of EVs in multiorgan assessment and identifying biomarkers in patients with severe COVID‐19 and possible long COVID.">

Cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of mortality following infection. In this review, we discuss immune pathogenesis and four medications, including Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Dexamethasone, and Annual SZ for COVID-19. A comparison of the effectiveness and therapeutic usage of drugs as reported in clinical trials and reports was made at different disease levels as well. Clinical studies indicate that Annual SZ with mild side effects was more affordable and might be more effective than other medications. Additionally, Annual SZ was capable of reducing the lev-els of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as viral attachment and RNA replication.">

        <tr id="Background: HIV-1 infection, even with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), is associated with chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, contributing to long-term health complications. Nicotine use, prevalent among people with HIV (PWH), is known to exacerbate immune activation and disease progression, but the precise biological mechanisms remain to be fully understood. This study sought to uncover the synergistic effects of HIV-1 infection and nicotine on immune cell function, focusing on beneficial insights into NLRP3 inflammasome activation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial pathways. Methods: Human tonsil explants were infected with HIV-1 and exposed to nicotine. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to profile immune cell populations and gene expression linked to inflammasome activation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and synergy assessments were conducted to investigate how nicotine modulates immune responses in the context of HIV. Results: The combination of HIV infection and nicotine exposure significantly increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thioredoxin, and components of oxidative phosphorylation. Conclusions: This study highlights how the combined effects of HIV-1 and nicotine offer valuable insights into immune modulation, opening doors for future therapeutic strategies. Targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome and addressing nicotine use may contribute to improved outcomes for PWH.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: COVID-19 is characterised by a wide variety of clinical manifestations, and clinical tests and genetic analysis might help to predict patient outcomes. Methods: In the current study, the expression of genes related to immune response (CCL5, IFI6, OAS1, IRF9, IL1B, and TGFB1) was analysed in the upper airway and paired-blood samples from 25 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. Relative gene expression was determined by RT-qPCR. Results: CCL5 expression was higher in the blood than in the upper airway (p < 0.001). In addition, a negative correlation was found between IFI6 and viral load (p = 0.033) in the upper airway, suggesting that the IFI6 expression inhibits the viral infection. Concerning sex, women expressed IL1B and IRF9 in a higher proportion than men at a systemic level (p = 0.008 and p = 0.049, respectively). However, an increased expression of IRF9 was found in men compared to women in the upper airway (p = 0.046), which could be due to the protective effect of IRF9, especially in men. Conclusions: The higher expression of CCL5 in blood might be due to the key role of this gene in the migration and recruitment of immune cells from the systemic circulation to the lungs. Our findings confirm the existence of sex differences in the immune response to early stages of the infection. Further studies in a larger cohort are necessary to corroborate the current findings.">

In this work, the aim is to study the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on the production of inflammatory markers and how this affect morbidity and mortality. Electronic medical record (EMR) data from 210 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from November 2020 to June 2021 were collected. The admitted patients were divided into three groups, the one-dose vaccinated, two-dose vaccinated, and the non-vaccinated. All patients were moderate or severe in disease level as defined by the WHO classification. The results show that CRP was 101 ± 5.3, 97 ± 10.8, and 145 ± 17.3 (p < 0.05), fibrinogen 529 ± 16.3, 397 ± 33.8, and 610 ± 15 (p < 0.05), D-dimer 1244 ± 89, 1279 ± 297, and 1615 ± 224 (p < 0.05), ferritin was 1170 ± 122, 999 ± 202, and 1663 ± 409 (p < 0.05), IL-6 was 196 ± 12, 96 ± 5, and 580 ± 402 (NS), for the non-vaccinated, one-dose vaccinated, and two-dose vaccinated groups, respectively. The high level of CRP up to 150–200 mg/dL was more common among the surviving vaccinated patients. Oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation, and mortality were higher in the non-vaccinated group. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was higher in the vaccinated patients, 25 ± 0.14 vs. 33 ± 6.15, respectively (p < 0.05). Inflammation markers were significantly higher in the vaccinated groups compared to non-vaccinated groups. On the other hand, extremely high levels of CRP (>200 mg/dL) were correlated with high mortality incidence.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic infection that affects the central nervous system. We used virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice that express the wild-type human tau protein (htau mice). VLP exposure elicited dose-dependent changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings of primary somatosensory and motor cortex neurons that express the jGCaMP7s calcium sensor tracked modifications of neuronal activity patterns following exposure to VLPs. There was a substantial short-term increase in stimulus-evoked activity metrics in both WT and htau VLP-injected mice, while htau mice showed also increased spontaneous activity metrics and increase activity in the vehicle-injected group. Over the following weeks, activity metrics in WT mice subsided, but remained above baseline levels. For htau mice, activity metrics either remain elevated or decreased to lower levels than baseline. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. The htau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background, exhibited more severe pathobiology that may lead to more adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="Chronic viral infections are ubiquitous in humans, with individuals harboring multiple latent viruses that can reactivate during acute illnesses. Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood. Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence (≥3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue. Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID- 19 and PASC.">

The interaction between TB and COVID-19 poses significant risks to patients, leading to increased morbidity and complicating treatment strategies as both diseases share similar clinical manifestations, such as respiratory symptoms and immune effects. As the global health system continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19 on existing infectious disease frameworks, it is imperative that researchers engage in research focused on understanding TB co-infection and COVID-19.

        <tr id="Disease-associated microglia (DAM) are a subset of microglia that appear at various stages of central nervous system neurodegenerative diseases. DAM were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing within Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) where they were characterized by their unique localization near amyloid-β plaques and their phagocytic and lipid-metabolizing features. Unfortunately, activation and etiology of DAM are only understood within the context of AD where Triggering Receptor Expressed On Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2), a receptor for amyloid-β, appears to be the key regulator in microglial transition to a DAM state. Despite this reliance on TREM2 in AD, DAM appear across other neurodegenerative diseases in which TREM2 may not be a critical player. This begs the question of if DAM are truly the same across all neurodegenerative diseases or if there exists a heterogeneity to DAM across neurodegenerative pathologies. Investigation into this critical gap in the field regarding DAM etiology and activation, as well as DAM function, could be delineated utilizing models of Parkinson’s disease (PD) to complement studies in models of AD. Though highly underexplored regarding DAM, PD with its pattern of protein aggregation-associated pathology like AD could serve as the spatiotemporal comparison against AD findings to ascertain the nature of DAM. The experimental vehicle that could guide the future of such investigation is the multi-omics model. With a compound approach focusing on exploring triggers for DAM at the chromatin or mRNA level and related protein output, it becomes possible to strongly characterize and firmly answer the question of what is a DAM.">

        <tr id="Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a phenomenon in which antibodies enhance subsequent viral infections rather than preventing them. Sub-optimal levels of neutralizing antibodies in individuals infected with dengue virus are known to be associated with severe disease upon reinfection with a different dengue virus serotype. For Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type-2 infection, three types of ADE have been proposed: (1) Fc receptor-dependent ADE of infection in cells expressing Fc receptors, such as macrophages by anti-spike antibodies, (2) Fc receptor-independent ADE of infection in epithelial cells by anti-spike antibodies, and (3) Fc receptor-dependent ADE of cytokine production in cells expressing Fc receptors, such as macrophages by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. This review focuses on the Fc receptor-dependent ADE of cytokine production induced by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, examining its potential role in severe COVID-19 during reinfection and its contribution to the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, i.e., prolonged symptoms lasting at least three months after the acute phase of the disease. We also discuss the protective effects of recently identified anti-spike antibodies that neutralize Omicron variants.">

        <tr id="Introduction An unprecedented breadth of longitudinal viral and multi-scale immunological data has been gathered during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to the high complexity, non-linearity, multi-dimensionality, mixed anatomic sampling, and possible autocorrelation of available immune data, it is challenging to identify the components of the innate and adaptive immune response that drive viral elimination. Novel mathematical models and analytical approaches are required to synthesize contemporaneously gathered cytokine, transcriptomic, flow cytometry, antibody response, and viral load data into a coherent story of viral control, and ultimately to discriminate drivers of mild versus severe infection. Methods We investigated a dataset describing innate, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell, and antibody responses in the lung during early and late stages of infection in immunologically naïve rhesus macaques. We used multi-model inference and ensemble modeling approaches from ecology and weather forecasting to compare and combine various competing models. Results and discussion Model outputs suggest that the innate immune response plays a crucial role in controlling early infection, while SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T cells correspond to later viral elimination, and anti-spike IgG antibodies do not impact viral dynamics. Among the numerous genes potentially contributing to the innate response, we identified IFI27 as most closely linked to viral load decline. A 90% knockdown of the innate response from our validated model resulted in a ~10-fold increase in peak viral load during infection. Our approach provides a novel methodological framework for future analyses of similar complex, non-linear multi-component immunologic data sets.">

        <tr id="Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a concern for world health since it may impact both the upper (nose, throat, sinuses) and lower (trachea, lungs) respiratory tracts. Death (at a rate of 10%), respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are among the problems that might arise. Recent years have seen a global spread of zoonotic coronaviruses, which have caused human epidemics such as MERS and SARS. Various clinical symptoms may be seen in this sickness because to the numerous changes in intestinal homeostasis caused by SARS-CoV-2. Because of the beneficial impact that probiotics have on the host immune system, gastrointestinal disorders may now be effectively treated. This article discusses the close relationship between what we eat, the bacteria in our gut, and the risk of contracting the COV-19 virus. 
Conclusion: The relationship between gut microbiota, dietary factors, and COVID-19 severity indicates that the microbiome may influence immune regulation. Imbalances in microbial communities and reduced diversity can intensify inflammation, potentially worsening COVID-19 outcomes. Strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary changes might provide therapeutic benefits by improving gut health and strengthening immune defenses. However, further research is required to clarify these mechanisms and establish effective interventions.">

        <tr id="During the COVID-19 pandemic, while most infected individuals experienced mild to moderate symptoms, a significant subset developed severe illness. A clinical test distinguishing between mild and severe cases could inform effective treatment strategies. Toward the latter stages of the pandemic, it became evident that vaccination or prior infection cannot entirely prevent reinfection. However, they are crucial in reducing the risk of severe disease by inducing T-cell memory. T cell receptors (TCRs), which can be obtained from human blood, serve as valuable biomarkers for monitoring T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we investigated the associations between TCR metrics and COVID-19 severity and found significant associations. Furthermore, such associations could depend on the subset of TCRs used (e.g., TCRs from CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells) and when the TCRs were collected.">

        <tr id="From December 2019 to March 2020, the human population faced a new coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, which led to global morbidity and high mortality worldwide. Typical features of coronavirus infection tended to resemble a seasonal infection over time. Despite this fact, it has been proven that, after acute disease, numerous disorders are detected in the patients, manifesting both with general health disturbances and as complications of pre-existing chronic diseases, including allergic syndrome. On the basis of these findings, the study of post-COVID syndrome became an important aspect of the ongoing COVID-19 research. It has been shown over recent decades that the number of people suffering from various types of allergic reactions is growing every year. Therefore, the studies in allergic pathology in the structure of post-COVID syndrome are among the most pressing issues. In addition to studying exacerbations of allergic reactions, a thorough analysis has shown that adverse reactions caused by coronavirus infection are viewed from new aspects, being characterized by functional disorders of acquired and innate immune response, causing increasingly severe consequences for the immune system and the whole body. Currently, the features of humoral immune response in post-COVID syndrome have not been sufficiently studied. In this respect, we have evaluated the features of humoral immunity in patients with post-COVID syndrome, with clinically confirmed allergic anamnesis. The study revealed changes in humoral immune system, indicating that the most significant changes are observed in post-COVID patients with a burdened history of allergies, thus requiring a more detailed study of immune status in order to develop an individualized approach to immunocorrection of these disorders in this group of patients.">

        <tr id="Persistent Covid (PC) represents a post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by symptoms that persist for more than 12 weeks after the acute phase. These symptoms, which include chronic fatigue, respiratory distress, cognitive dysfunction, and other multisystem effects, significantly impact the quality of life of the affected individuals. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood, although studies have suggested a multifactorial origin. Proposed factors include viral persistence, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation disturbances, and gut dysbiosis. The identification of these mechanisms could facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, opening new perspectives for the effective management of persistent Covid. The diagnosis of PC is complex due to the diversity of symptoms and the lack of specific biomarkers. At present, therapeutic approaches focus primarily on symptomatic relief, but further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying PC and to develop targeted interventions.

        <tr id="Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) patients are at high risk of severe infections including COVID-19 due to an immune dysregulation affecting both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, our understanding of the immune responses to infection and vaccination in MM patients is limited. To gain more detailed insights into infection- and vaccine-elicited T cell immunity in MM, we studied the CD8+ T cell response on the single-epitope level in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and mRNA-vaccinated MM patients. Methods: We compared peptide/MHC class I tetramer-enriched SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells and antibody responses in MM patients (convalescent: n = 16, fully vaccinated: n = 5, vaccinated convalescent: n = 5) and healthy controls (HCs) (convalescent: n = 58, fully vaccinated: n = 7) either after infection with SARS-CoV-2 alone, complete mRNA vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection and single-shot mRNA vaccination (hybrid immunity). Results: MM patients have lower frequencies and a lower proportion of fully functional virus-specific CD8+ T cells compared to HCs, after both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. CD8+ T cell memory subset distribution in MM patients is skewed towards reduced frequencies of central memory (TCM) T cells and higher frequencies of effector memory 1 (TEM1) T cells. In contrast, the humoral immune response was comparable in both cohorts after viral clearance. Notably, CD8+ T cell frequencies as well as the humoral immune response were improved by a single dose of mRNA vaccine in convalescent MM patients. Conclusions: MM patients have relative immunological deficiencies in SARS-CoV-2 immunity but benefit from hybrid immunity. These findings underline the relevance of vaccinations in this vulnerable patient group.">

        <tr id="Dear editor We have carefully reviewed Gambari and Finotti’s letter concerning our recent review, “Interplay of Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) and SARS-CoV-2: Unveiling the Complex Mechanisms of Inflammation and Severity in COVID-19 Infections”. Their thoughtful comments provide a valuable perspective that deepens the scientific discourse on therapeutic strategies, particularly by exploring microRNAs (miRNAs) as regulatory agents within the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. Their suggestion to employ specific miRNAs - such as miR-93 and miR-145-5p - as modulators of TLR4 signaling aligns closely with our goal of attenuating the heightened immune response associated with severe COVID-19 cases. As Gambari and Finotti aptly highlight, miRNAs could serve as precise regulators of TLR4-driven cytokine production, thus dampening the intensity of the inflammatory cascade that can lead to adverse clinical outcomes. Specifically, applying miRNA mimics, such as miR-93-5p, which targets pro-inflammatory pathways, offers a promising approach to modulate the TLR4/NF-κB axis, potentially reducing cytokine storm severity. Their approach to miRNA-based therapeutics introduces a sophisticated therapeutic paradigm. This strategy, which extends beyond the direct inhibition of TLR4, may allow modulation of downstream inflammatory mediators and enable a finely tuned immune response. Such a multi-tiered strategy could address the immune dysregulation observed in severe COVID-19 cases, minimizing hyper-inflammation while preserving essential antiviral functions. Further, Gambari and Finotti also present evidence indicating that miRNAs can inhibit NF-κB-mediated expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Oligodendrocytes (OL) and their myelin-forming processes are targeted and lost during the disease course of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), targeted by infiltrating leukocytes and their effector cytokines. Myelin repair is considered to be dependent on recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The basis of failure of re-myelination during the disease course of MS remains to be defined. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of pro-inflammatory molecules tumor necrosis factor ⍰ (TNF⍰) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) on the differentiation of human OPCs. Methods We generated human OPCs from induced pluripotent stem cells with a reporter gene under the OL-specific transcription factor SOX10. We treated the cells in vitro with TNF⍰ or IFNγ and evaluated effects in terms of cell viability, expression of OL-lineage markers, and co- expression of astrocyte markers. To relate our findings to the molecular properties of OPCs as found in the MS brain we re-analyzed publicly available single nuclear RNAseq datasets. Results Our analysis indicated that both TNF⍰ and IFNγ decreased the proportion of cells differentiating into the OL-lineage; consistent with previous reports. We now observe the TNF⍰ effect is linked to aberrant OPC differentiation. A subset of O4+, reporter-positive cells co- expressed the astrocytic marker Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). On the transcriptomic level, the cells acquire an astrocyte-like signature alongside a conserved reactive phenotype. Analysis of single- nuclear RNAseq datasets from human MS brain revealed a subset of OPCs expressing an astrocytic signature. Discussion In the context of MS, these results imply that OPCs are present but inhibited from differentiating along the OL-lineage, with a subset acquiring a reactive and stem-cell like phenotype, reducing their capacity to contribute towards repair. These findings help define a potential basis for the impaired myelin repair in MS and provide a prospective route for regenerative treatment.">

 Introduction: Cytokine storm (CS) is a severe hyperinflammatory disorder characterized by the overproduction of diverse inflammatory cytokines, manifesting as high fever, vascular leakage, nausea, hypotension, and even multi-organ failure. CS can occur as a complication in various conditions, primarily chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These represent the three major triggers of CS: iatrogenic causes, infections, and autoimmune conditions. Given the heterogeneity of CS triggers, the clinical features and immune landscapes of CS vary widely, necessitating tailored management strategies. However, the detailed immune profiles of CS across these diverse settings are not well characterized, hindering the identification of common and distinct mechanisms underlying this hyperinflammatory complication.
 Methods and Results: Here, we constructed a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in CS with data from three representative disease settings: CAR-T cell therapy, COVID-19, and SLE. The total sample count is 416, encompassing 2,304,606 cells. We collected 111 samples from multiple myeloma (MM) patients who received anti-BCMA CAR-T treatment and experienced CS events at our center, with ethical approval and informed consent from all participants. The scRNA-seq data for COVID-19 (n=221), SLE (n=40), and healthy donor controls (n=44) were retrieved from online open-access publications. Samples from the progression stage of each disease showed significantly elevated expression of CS-related genes, indicating an inflammatory status. We further analyzed the enriched cellular subclusters and expression profiles of these samples to reveal the unique CS landscape of each disease. The results showed that CS following CAR-T therapy was strongly associated with actively proliferating CD8+ T cells, with gene expressions enriched in T cell function-related pathways, such as MAPK and NLR signaling pathways. We also identified an increased percentage of CD8+ exhausted T cells in CS following CAR-T therapy, which might significantly contribute to the abnormal inflammatory responses. Moreover, COVID-19 progression was characterized by unique dynamics of myeloid immune cells, particularly CD14+ monocytes with S100A8 expression and neutrophils with enhanced interferon signaling. Interestingly, in myeloid immune cells from the COVID-19 progression stage, KEGG analysis revealed significantly enriched expressions of genes involved in neuronal transduction, suggesting the potential crosstalk between systemic inflammation and neuronal functions. In SLE, translation activities and ribosome functions were significantly elevated in B cells and plasma cells. Additionally, myeloid immune cells in SLE were enriched for genes involved in phagocytosis, antigen processing, and antigen presentation, showing the over-active status of phagocytotic monocytes/macrophages, which contributes to systemic inflammation.
 Significance: Our large-scale single-cell transcriptomic analysis of CS in three distinct disease contexts uncovered the unique and shared immune landscapes underlying CS across different conditions. Our findings highlight the distinct contributions of specific immune cell subclusters and signaling pathways in each disease context, suggesting potential targets for tailored therapeutic strategies and advancing our understanding of this complex hyperinflammatory complication.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was linked to significant neurological and psychiatric manifestations. This review examines the physiopathological mechanisms underlying these neuropsychiatric outcomes and discusses current management strategies. Primarily a respiratory disease, COVID-19 frequently leads to neurological issues, including cephalalgia and migraines, loss of sensory perception, cerebrovascular accidents, and neurological impairment such as encephalopathy. Lasting neuropsychological effects have also been recorded in individuals following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting a lasting impact on mental health. The neuroinvasive potential of the virus, inflammatory responses, and the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in neuroinflammation are critical factors in neuropsychiatric COVID-19 manifestations. In addition, the review highlights the importance of monitoring biomarkers to assess Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement. Management strategies for these neuropsychiatric conditions include supportive therapy, antiepileptic drugs, antithrombotic therapy, and psychotropic drugs, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Understanding the long-term neuropsychiatric implications of COVID-19 is essential for developing effective treatment protocols and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Some autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are preceded by a critical subclinical phase of disease activity. Proactive clinical management is hampered by a lack of biological understanding of this subclinical ‘at-risk’ state and the changes underlying disease development. In a cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-omics study of peripheral immunity in the autoantibody-positive at-risk for RA period, we identified systemic inflammation, proinflammatory-skewed B cells, expanded Tfh17-like cells, epigenetic bias in naive T cells, TNF+IL1B+ monocytes resembling a synovial macrophage population, and CD4 T cell transcriptional features resembling those suppressed by abatacept (CTLA4-Ig) in RA patients. Our findings characterize pathogenesis prior to clinical diagnosis and suggest the at-risk state exhibits substantial immune alterations that could potentially be targeted for early intervention to delay or prevent autoimmunity.

 Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe psoriatic subtype characterized by epidermal neutrophil infiltration, often occurring in acute, potentially life-threatening episodes. However, the characterization of the immune microenvironment in GPP lesions compared with plaque psoriasis remains largely unknown. Here, we used single-cell RNA profiling to interrogate the transcriptomes of ∼60 000 single cells from GPP lesional skin (n = 13) and healthy adult skin (n = 4), combined with spatial RNA sequencing. GPP was associated with major shifts in multiple cell populations, including, in particular, increased frequency of myeloid immune cells and supraspinous keratinocytes. We identified a unique myeloid-derived neutrophil subset characterized by the absence of CASP8. CASP8− neutrophils were accompanied by high expression of inflammatory pathway genes, including RIPK1, NF-KB1, IL1B, CXCL1, and CXCL8 in a stable disease state and were found at low levels in an inactive state in healthy skin. Spatial mapping of these genes illustrated the neutrophil transition from pre-inflammation to a pro-inflammation state through casting off CASP8. In silico and in vitro co-culture studies demonstrated that the communication network between IL36G+ spinous KCs and neutrophils is enlarged in the GPP lesions, with TNFSF15 (TL1A) released from neutrophils exaggerating the inflammatory crosstalk. While there was a slight increase in Th17 cells, there was greater prominence of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells highlighted by upregulated GZMB, CCL5, NKG7, and PRF1 expression, hinting at a cytotoxicity tendency rather than inflammation response in GPP lesions. Notably, a subset of S100A9+ fibroblasts in GPP was observed to contribute to the amplification of the GPP immune network through the transition to a pro-inflammatory state, connected by ligand–receptor interactions with other spatially proximate immune cells, including Th17 cells, CD8+ Tc cells, neutrophils, and IL1B+ macrophages. In sum, these data provide an in-depth view of immune cell participation and highlight the role of neutrophil–KC–fibroblast crosstalk in GPP pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of long COVID (LC) still presents many areas of uncertainty. This leads to difficulties in finding an effective specific therapy. We hypothesize that the key to LC pathogenesis lies in the presence of chronic functional damage to the main anti-inflammatory mechanisms of our body: the three reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis, and the mitochondrial redox status. We will illustrate that this neuro-endocrine-metabolic axis is closely interconnected and how the SARS-CoV-2 can damage it at all stages through direct, immune-inflammatory, epigenetic damage mechanisms, as well as through the reactivation of neurotropic viruses. According to our theory, the direct mitochondrial damage carried out by the virus, which replicates within these organelles, and the cellular oxidative imbalance, cannot be countered in patients who develop LC. This is because their anti-inflammatory mechanisms are inconsistent due to reduced vagal tone and direct damage to the endocrine glands of the HPA axis. We will illustrate how acetylcholine (ACh) and cortisol, with its cytoplasmatic and cellular receptors respectively, are fundamental players in the LC process. Both Ach and cortisol play multifaceted and synergistic roles in reducing inflammation. They achieve this by modulating the activity of innate and cell-mediated immunity, attenuating endothelial and platelet activation, and modulating mitochondrial function, which is crucial for cellular energy production and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In our opinion, it is essential to study the sensitivity of the glucocorticoids receptor in people who develop LC and whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause long-term epigenetic variations in its expression and function.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection poses a significant global health threat, yet our understanding of its immunopathogenesis remains incomplete due to limitations of existing models. Here, we establish an in vitro whole-blood model using hirudin, an anticoagulant that preserves complement activity and cellular interactions, to study DENV infection. Our model reveals the susceptibility of all major leukocyte populations to DENV infection, with monocytes and granulocytes demonstrating high permissiveness and production of infectious virus progeny. Notably, granulocytes emerge as previously unrecognized targets of DENV infection, highlighting the importance of studying viral tropism within a physiologically relevant context. We also observed efficient DENV binding to B cells, but limited production of infectious virus, suggesting a potential role in viral sequestration or immune dysregulation. Interestingly, both NK and T cells, while less permissive, were also found to be susceptible to DENV infection. Our ex vivo analysis of whole blood from DENV-infected patients confirms the susceptibility of granulocytes, monocytes, B cells, natural killer cells, and T cells to infection, further validating the clinical relevance of our model. Additionally, we observed dynamic changes in circulating blood cell populations during acute dengue, potentially reflecting both direct virus-mediated effects and immune responses. This whole-blood model offers a valuable tool for investigating the complex interplay between DENV and host factors, facilitating a deeper understanding of dengue pathogenesis and ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a significant global health threat, with increasing incidence in endemic regions and expanding geographic range due to factors like global warming. Current models for studying DENV pathogenesis often lack the complexity of the human immune system, hindering the development of effective therapies and vaccines. To address this, we have established the first in vitro whole-blood model using hirudin, preserving critical immune components and cellular interactions. This model reveals granulocytes as previously unrecognized targets of productive DENV infection, challenging existing paradigms of viral tropism. Our ex vivo analysis of patient blood samples confirms the clinical relevance of this finding and validates our model’s utility. This unique model offers a powerful platform for future studies to dissect the complex interactions between DENV and the host immune system, including the roles of different leukocyte populations, ultimately informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this devastating disease.">

        <tr id="A positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that devastated the world. While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID- 19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), belonging to the Flaviviridae family, has been a severe threat to human health since the worldwide outbreak. ZIKV is capable of inducing fetal microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other serious neurological complications. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) is a key member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, functioning in selective mRNA splicing and gene expression regulation. Our previous study has indicated that the expression of PTBP1 increases in astrocytes upon ZIKV infection, yet the precise regulatory mechanisms underlying its role in viral replication remain elusive. In this study, we elucidated the specific pathway by which ZIKV upregulates PTBP1 expression through the activation of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression. Further investigation revealed that overexpression of PTBP1 effectively inhibits viral replication, whereas knockdown of PTBP1 significantly enhances viral replication. Mechanistically, using co-immunoprecipitation assays for protein interaction screening, we identified an interaction between PTBP1 and ZIKV non-structural protein NS1. Detailed studies demonstrated that PTBP1 bound and colocalized with NS1 to lead to the degradation of NS1 protein via a lysosomal pathway. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel mechanism underlying that ZIKV infection induces the expression of PTBP1 via the HIF-1α pathway, subsequently the accumulated PTBP1 binds to ZIKV NS1 protein to promote NS1 degradation, thereby effectively inhibiting viral replication. The study illustrates a distinct restricted cellular factor that regulates ZIKV replication, which provides a potential target for the control of the viral replication and pathogenesis during the ZIKV epidemic. Importance Since the outbreak of ZIKV infection among human in 2014, a Zika epidemic has caused Zika fever accompanied with fetal microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neurological symptoms. Emerging evidence reveals that ZIKV infects astrocytes to specially induce the expression of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), one of hnRNPs members. However, the interplay between PTBP1 and ZIKV replication is highly concerned. Here, we uncover a distinct manner that ZIKV infection induces PTBP1 expression through the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signal. Additionally, activation of HIF-1α signal hinders ZIKV replication relying on PTBP1 accumulation. Further investigations suggest that PTBP1 restrains ZIKV replication by interacting with ZIKV NS1 protein, thereby leading to the degradation of NS1 protein via a lysosomal pathway. Collectively, our findings illustrate a novel restricted cellular factor PTBP1 mediated by HIF-1α that regulates ZIKV replication, which provides a potential therapeutic target of the viral replication and pathogenesis against ZIKV pandemic.">

        <tr id="The development of new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic potential of microvascular endothelium. A specific feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the post-COVID syndrome that is characterised by long-term impairment of various organs and systems. The immune pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis requires special attention due to their baseline pro-inflammatory status. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of novel coronavirus infection on the risk of chronic systemic hyper-inflammation and low-grade systemic inflammation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Two main groups consisted of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had survived COVID-19 (mild form) 3 months ago, or at earlier terms, including the subjects with post-COVID symptoms and those free of these symptoms. The comparison group included patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without a history of COVID-19. The control group was presented by healthy blood donors. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFá), D-dimers, troponin I, cortisol, and endothelin I (ET-I) were measured in patients’ plasma by immunoassay technique. On the basis of these markers, we calculated integral indices of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) – the levels of reactivity (RL), and chronic systemic hyper-inflammation (ChSI). Low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) was diagnosed in absence of ChSI, but in cases of simultaneous increase of D-dimer levels 250 ng/ml and ET-I levels 90 pg/ml in the patient. 
The most prevalent symptoms of post-COVID in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were tachycardia, arthralgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, which correspond to the population-wide data. By all empirical parameters, the groups of tuberculosis patients were comparable to each other (p 0.05) and significantly differed from control group. However, evaluation of integral indexes is more crucial for assessing the ‘systemic’ origin of the process. Thus, 23-50% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed subcritical SIR (RL = 1-2), being a feature of ChSI in 7.1-13.6% of cases (both in COVID-19 reconvalescents and non-COVID-19 patients). Meanwhile, all patient groups did not show significant difference in the frequency of LGSI and endothelial dysfunction (p 0.05). However, there was a trend towards an increase of these scores in the following sequence: tuberculosis without COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 – tuberculosis + COVID-19 + post-COVID syndrome. 
Most patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are not characterized by the development of chronic systemic hyperinflammation. LGSI is the most probable feature of general pathology in tuberculosis infection. Tuberculosis infection sufficiently contributes to the development of LGSI, since the frequency and severity of LGSI and its individual manifestations are independent on the new coronavirus infection and signs of post-COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bacillus anthracis causes anthrax through a combination of bacterial infection and toxemia. As a major virulence factor of B. anthracis, anthrax lethal toxin (LT) is a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase, exerting its cytotoxicity through proteolytic cleavage of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases, thereby shutting down the MAPK pathways. Anthrax lethal toxin induces host lethality mostly by targeting the cardiovascular system. Although the enzymatic activity and the molecular targets of LT have long been known, the detailed mechanisms underlying cellular/tissue/organ toxicity are still poorly understood. In this work, we sought to investigate the mechanism of LT-induced cellular damage in the cardiovascular system. We demonstrate for the first time that anthrax lethal toxin has potent inhibitory effects on the central metabolism of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. This is likely due to the observed downregulating of c-Myc expression through the toxin-induced inhibition of the ERK pathway. Since c-Myc is a master transcription factor controlling the expression of many rate-limiting metabolic enzymes in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, LT’s downregulation of c-Myc may lead to the observed bioenergetic collapse, particularly, in cardiomyocytes. Since cardiac cell contraction requires continuous production of large amounts of ATP, potent inhibition of the bioenergetics of cardiomyocytes would be incompatible with life. Thus, LT-induced lethality through targeting cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells appears to be a consequence of a bioenergetic collapse, likely due to the toxin’s potent inhibitory activity on the MEK-ERK-c-Myc-metabolic/bioenergetic axis within these target cells of cardiovascular system. IMPORTANCE Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) is a major virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis, the causative pathogen of anthrax disease. Anthrax lethal toxin is a metalloproteinase that cleaves and inactivates MEKs, thereby shutting down MAPK pathways, leading to host mortality primarily through targeting of the cardiovascular system. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the toxin’s cellular and tissue toxicity are still poorly understood. Here, we found that anthrax lethal toxin has potent inhibitory activity on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. These effects appear to be the consequence of downregulation of c-Myc, a master transcription factor that controls many rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. With the high demand on energy for cardiac contraction, the potent inhibition of cardiomyocyte metabolism by LT would be incompatible with life. This work provides critical insights into why the cardiovascular system is the major in vivo target of LT-induced lethality.">

        <tr id="Controlled activation of macrophages to achieve desired phenotypes in vivo and in vitro could lead to possible treatments for several inflammatory and proliferative diseases. This investigation uniquely established that dengue protease enhances the polarization and activation of human and murine macrophages following extracellular exposure. It was observed that macrophages have a robust response to extracellularly administered purified dengue NS2B/NS3 protease; it stimulated the macrophages in classical M1 directions and enhanced both the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). The cells exhibited an increase in the intracellular levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ and an elevation of phosphorylated versions of Akt, P38 MARK, SAPK, and ERK. In tandem, this investigation also established that the heightened responses of stimulated cells were associated with an increase in the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB (P65) protein. The cell viability assay showed that NS2B/NS3 protease exerts no major toxic effect on macrophages after 24 hours of treatment, even at a dosage (20 μg/ml) which was four times higher than the effective dose (5 μg/ml). Remarkably, we also observed that the native form of the viral protease, which drives its enzyme activities, had no bearing on the antigenic qualities of the enzyme. Thus, our study highlighted the efficacy of dengue viral NS2B/NS3 protease as a non-toxic ex vivo macrophage activating/polarizing agent and may serve a vital role in macrophage-based cell therapy in the near future.">

        <tr id="Recent research has demonstrated significant aberrant activation of the innate immune system in ALS model systems due to mutations in SOD1, TARDBP and C9orf72 through stimulation of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway. This pathway can be activated, for example, by cGAS-STING-dependent sensing of cytosolic DNA that accumulates as a result of chronic DNA damage and defective mitochondria, both of which have been identified as early pathology in FUS-ALS spinal motor neurons (sMNs). Therefore, we analysed innate immune pathways in isogenic and non-isogenic FUSmut iPSC-derived sMNs, which revealed upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and activation of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway in FUSmut sMNs. Notably, we found evidence for accumulation of cytosolic dsRNA and its sensor RIG-I in FUS-ALS. RIG-I, but not MDA5, was found to be significantly upregulated in FUSmut sMNs, and siRNA-mediated knockdown abolished the increased IFN1 activation in FUSmut sMNs. In post-mortem analysis, RIG-I was highly expressed in the remaining α-MNs. IFN treatment of FUSwt sMNs phenocopied the axonal degeneration of FUSmut sMNs. Mechanistically, DNA damage induction did not increase ISG expression, but dsRNA was increased in the mitochondria of FUSmut sMNs. Mitochondrial transcription, a known source of dsRNA, was found to be upregulated in compartmental axonal RNAseq analysis and its inhibition reduced ISGs in FUS-ALS sMNs. Furthermore, the JAK-STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib alleviated the upregulated ISG expression and reversed the axonal degeneration of sMNs. Finally, we analysed ISG expression in peripheral blood samples from 18 FUS-ALS patients, eight of whom had a significantly elevated interferon signature. Blood ISGs correlated with disease progression rate and negatively with disease duration. RIG-I-mediated innate immune activation in sMNs may be an interesting novel individualised biomarker-driven therapeutic target in (FUS-) ALS. A one-sentence summary of your paper RIG-I-I-mediated innate immune activation is found in FUS-ALS spinal motor neurons caused by cytosolic dsRNA accumulation due to mitochondrial transcriptional activation and is amenable to JAK-STAT inhibition and might thus be an interesting novel individualized biomarker-driven therapeutic approach in (FUS-) ALS">

        <tr id="Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily targets mitochondria. However, the description of mitochondrial signaling in immune cells remains limited in COVID-19. This study aimed to elucidate the pivotal roles played by immune cells and mitochondria in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the resulting clinical outcomes. Methods We obtained epidemiological characteristics, laboratory parameters and T cell mitochondrial damage indicators in 296 COVID-19 patients. And we further evaluated the predictive value of novel T lymphocyte mitochondrial markers and conventional immune inflammatory markers as clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Finally, Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent risk factors associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Results The severe group exhibited lower counts of Mito+CD3+, Mito+CD4+, and Mito+CD8+ cells compared to the non-severe group. Significantly higher positive rates of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+T cell mitochondrial damage were observed in the severe group compared to the non-severe group. The CD3+CD8+T cells MMP-low% had the highest AUC value of 0.864 (95% CI =0.794–0.934) to evaluate COVID-19 outcome. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that CD3+T cells MMP-low%, CD3+CD4+T cells MMP-low% and CD3+CD8+T cells MMP-low% were independent risk factors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Our research suggests that a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients exhibited mitochondrial impairment with T-lymphocyte. T cells mitochondrial markers can serve as predictive factors and independent risk factors for predicting adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients.">

So far, HERVs have been studied in the context of extensive immunopathogenic, neuropathogenic and even oncogenic effects within their host. In particular, in our paper, we elaborate on the aspects related to the possible correlation of transposable HERV elements’ activation and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s presence in cells of COVID-19 patients or upon COVID-19 vaccination with implications for natural and adaptive immunity. In particular, the release of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 occurs in such cases and plays a notable role in sustaining chronic inflammation. Moreover, well-known interindividual variations of HERVs might partially account for the interpersonal variability of COVID-19 symptoms or unwanted events post-vaccination. Accordingly, further studies are required to clarify the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s role in triggering HERVs.">

We previously identified that patient iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Mg) harboring the Alzheimer's disease (AD) TREM2R47H hypomorph display several functional deficits linked to metabolism. To investigate whether these deficits are associated with disruptions in metabolite signaling, we generated common variant, TREM2R47H and TREM2-/- variant human iPS-Mg. We assessed the ability of supplementation with citrate or succinate, key metabolites and cell cycle breaking points upon microglia activation, to overcome these functional deficits with potential impact on neurons. Succinate supplementation was more effective than citrate at overcoming mitochondrial deficits in OXPHOS and did not promote a glycolytic switch. Citrate enhanced the lipid content of TREM2R47H iPS-Mg and was more effective at overcoming Αβ phagocytic deficits, whereas succinate increased lipid content and phagocytic capacity in TREM2-/- iPS-Mg. Microglia cytokine secretion upon pro-inflammatory activation was moderately affected by citrate or succinate showing a condition-dependent increasing trend. Neither metabolite altered basal levels of soluble TREM2 shedding. In addition, neither citrate nor succinate enhanced glycolysis; instead, drove their effects through oxidative phosphorylation. IPS-neurons exposed to conditioned medium from TREM2 variant iPS-Mg showed changes in oxidative phosphorylation, which could be ameliorated when iPS-Mg were first treated with citrate or succinate. Our data point to discrete pathway linkage between microglial metabolism and functional outcomes with implications for AD pathogenesis and treatments.">

        <tr id="Stroke is a severe neurological disease and a major worldwide issue, mostly manifesting as ischemic stroke (IS). In order to create effective treatments for IS, it is imperative to fully understand the underlying pathologies, as the existing therapeutic choices are inadequate. Recent investigations have shown the complex relationships between several programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, and their correlation with immune responses during IS. However, this relationship is still unclear. To address this gap, this review study explored the cellular interactions in the immune microenvironment of IS. Then, to validate prior findings and uncover biomarkers, the study investigated bioinformatics studies. Several pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK), were involved in PCD-immune interactions. The bioinformatics studies reported key biomarkers such as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), gasdermin D (GSDMD), and TLR4, which have important implications in ferroptosis, cuproptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis respectively. These biomarkers were associated with PCD mechanisms such as oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions. The immune infiltration analysis consistently revealed a significant correlation between PCD pathways and detrimental immune cells, such as neutrophils and γδ T cells. Conversely, M2 macrophages and T helper cells showed protective effects. In conclusion, considering the intricate network of interactions between immune responses and PCD pathways, this study emphasized the necessity of a paradigm shift in therapeutic approaches to address the injuries that are related to this complex network.">

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global pandemic affecting millions of people's lives, which has led to 'post-COVID-19 fatigue'. Alarmingly, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only infects the lungs but also influences the heart and brain. Endothelial cell dysfunction and hypercoagulation, which we know occur with this infection, lead to thrombo-inflammation that can manifest as many myriad cardio-cerebrovascular disorders, such as brain fog, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, etc. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with oxidative stress, protein aggregation, cytokine storm, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, the identification of molecular targets involved in these actions could provide strategies for preventing and treating this disease. In particular, the very common enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) has recently been identified as a candidate co-receptor for the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with its involvement in infection. In addition, DPPIV has been reported as a co-receptor for some viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It mediates immunologic reactions and diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension, which have been considered the prime risk factors for stroke among other types of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), DPPIV has been implicated in aggravating the course of infection due to its disruptive effect on inflammatory signaling networks and the neuro-glia-vascular unit. Regarding the neurological, physiological, and molecular grounds governing post-COVID-19 fatigue, this review focuses on DPPIV as one of such reasons that progressively establishes cerebrovascular grievances following SARS-CoV infection.">

        <tr id="Hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibit diverse immune responses during acute infection, which are associated with a wide range of clinical outcomes. However, understanding these immune heterogeneities and their links to various clinical complications, especially long COVID, remains a challenge. In this study, we performed unsupervised subtyping of longitudinal multi-omics immunophenotyping in over 1,000 hospitalized patients, identifying two critical subtypes linked to mortality or mechanical ventilation with prolonged hospital stay and three severe subtypes associated with timely acute recovery. We confirmed that unresolved systemic inflammation and T-cell dysfunctions were hallmarks of increased severity and further distinguished patients with similar acute respiratory severity by their distinct immune profiles, which correlated with differences in demographic and clinical complications. Notably, one critical subtype (SubF) was uniquely characterized by early excessive inflammation, insufficient anticoagulation, and fatty acid dysregulation, alongside higher incidences of hematologic, cardiac, and renal complications, and an elevated risk of long COVID. Among the severe subtypes, significant differences in viral clearance and early antiviral responses were observed, with one subtype (SubC) showing strong early T-cell cytotoxicity but a poor humoral response, slower viral clearance, and greater risks of chronic organ dysfunction and long COVID. These findings provide crucial insights into the complex and context-dependent nature of COVID-19 immune responses, highlighting the importance of personalized therapeutic strategies to improve both acute and long-term outcomes.">

        <tr id="This study aimed to identify novel serological targets and investigate immune responses in patients with non-infectious uveitis, focusing on differences between initial onset and recurrent episodes. Differential gene expression analysis, immunocyte typing and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene analysis were conducted on RNA-sequenced peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals (n = 6) and non-infectious uveitis patients (n = 12), divided into 6 patients each at initial onset and recurrent stages. Peripheral blood T-cell types were analysed using flow cytometry. Bioinformatics methods included tools for RNA sequencing data processing, CIBERSORT for immune cell type prediction and specialized software for TCR repertoire analysis. Findings indicated that individuals with recurrent uveitis demonstrated a stronger adaptive immune response and a more pronounced immune imbalance compared to those with initial onset. Memory T cells were predominant in recurrent episodes, suggesting their potential role as biomarkers for disease progression. Significant differences in TCR diversity and V(D)J gene usage were observed between the various uveitis groups and healthy controls. Importantly, 38 uveitis-specific TCR sequences showed substantial expansion in the uveitis patients compared to controls. An elevated expansion of these specific TCR sequences was associated with an increased risk of uveitis development. The study highlights the critical role of adaptive immune responses and specific immune cell types in the pathogenesis of recurrent uveitis. Identification of the uveitis-specific TCR repertoire set could provide deeper insights into the disease and facilitate the development of targeted therapies for uveitis patients.">

Although the etiology of T1D is not fully understood, it is linked to dysregulation of the T-cell compartment. To identify T-cell signatures associated with T1D, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood T-cells from newly diagnosed children, the same children after one year, and healthy donors. We observed reduced expression of genes related to effector and cytotoxic T-cell functions across conventional, unconventional, and regulatory T-cell subsets in diabetic children, particularly at the time of diagnosis. These findings were supported by flow cytometry analysis of the same cohort and by reanalysis of publicly available data. Overall, our results suggest that T1D is associated with impaired T-cell effector differentiation, which may contribute to immune dysregulation and loss of self-tolerance.">

        <tr id="Abstract Sepsis‐induced acute lung injury (SALI) is characterized by a high incidence and mortality rate, which has caused a serious medical burden. The pharmacological effects of esculetin (ELT), such as antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory actions, have been widely confirmed. However, the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of ELT on SALI still need to be further clarified. In this study, we first evaluated the therapeutic potential of ELT on a caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced septic rat model, particularly in the treatment of acute lung injury. Afterwards, we explored the effect of ELT on macrophage polarization in vivo and in vitro. Then, we investigated the anti‐inflammatory mechanism of ELT based on modulating the metabolic reprogramming of macrophage (the effect on glycolysis in M1, and the effect on fatty acid β‐oxidation in M2). In addition, macrophage metabolic inhibitors (glycolysis inhibitor: 2‐DG, and fatty acid β‐oxidation inhibitor: etomoxir) were used to verify the regulatory effect of ELT on macrophage metabolic reprogramming. Our results proved that ELT intervention could effectively improve the survival rate of SALI rats and ameliorate pathological injury. Next, we found that ELT intervention inhibited M1 polarization and promoted M2 polarization of macrophages in vivo and in vitro, including the downregulation of M1‐related markers (CD86, iNOS), the decrease of pro‐inflammatory factors (nitric oxide, IL‐1β, IL‐6, and TNF‐α), the upregulation of M2‐related markers (CD206, ARG‐1), the increase of immunomodulatory factors (IL‐4 and IL‐10). Subsequently, seahorse analysis showed that ELT intervention inhibited the glycolytic capacity in M1, and promoted the ability of fatty acid β‐oxidation in M2. Besides, ELT intervention inhibited the level of glycolysis product (lactic acid), and the expression of glycolysis‐related genes (Glut1, Hk2, Pfkfb1, Pkm and Ldha) and promoted the expression of fatty acid β‐oxidation related genes (Cpt1a, Cpt2, Acox1). In addition, we found that the inhibitory effect of ELT on M1 polarization was comparable to that of 2‐DG, while intervention with etomoxir abolished the promoting effect of ELT on M2 polarization. ELT inhibited the inflammatory response in SALI by correcting macrophage polarization (inhibiting M1 and promoting M2). The mechanism of ELT on macrophage polarization was associated with regulating metabolic reprogramming (inhibiting glycolysis in M1 and promoting fatty acid β‐oxidation in M2).">

        <tr id="We aimed to study transcriptional and phenotypic changes in circulating immune cells associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19, resolution of pulmonary fibrosis in post-COVID-19-Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and persistence of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Whole blood and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 227 subjects with COVID-19, post-COVID-19 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), IPF and controls. We measured a 50-gene signature (nCounter, Nanostring) previously found to be predictive of IPF and COVID-19 mortality along with plasma levels of several biomarkers by Luminex. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing in PBMC (10X Genomics) to determine the cellular source of the 50-gene signature. We identified the presence of three genomic risk profiles in COVID-19 based on the 50-gene signature associated with low, intermediate, or high-risk of mortality and with significant differences in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines. COVID-19 patients in the high-risk group had increased expression of seven genes in CD14+HLA-DRlowCD163+Monocytic-Myeloid-Derived Suppressive cells (7Gene-M-MDSCs) and decreased expression of 43 genes in CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets. The loss of 7Gene-M-MDSC and increased expression of these 43 genes in T cells was seen in survivors with post-COVID-19-ILD. On the contrary, IPF patients had low expression of the 43 genes in CD4 and CD8 T cells. Collectively, we showed that a 50-gene, high-risk profile, predictive of IPF and COVID-19 mortality is characterized by a genomic imbalance in monocyte and T-cell subsets. This imbalance reverses in survivors with post-COVID-19-ILD highlighting genomic differences between post-COVID-19-ILD and IPF.">

 Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with systemic effects and currently has no cure due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. To gain better insights into the immune response associated with psoriasis, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing and parallel single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) profiling on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 11 psoriasis patients and 8 healthy controls. Additionally, we analysed two pairs of skin samples from the psoriasis cohort and performed spatial transcriptomics on two other pairs of skin samples. Our study identified specific immune signatures in myeloid and lymphocyte subsets both in blood and skin and highlighted characteristics of the immune repertoire in psoriasis. Notably, we found an increased proportion of circulating CD14+ monocytes. Furthermore, circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells in psoriasis patients exhibited heightened expression of genes associated with skin-homing and pro-inflammatory responses. Circulating T cells in these patients showed decreased expression of activation markers. In psoriatic lesions, we observed that resting CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells displayed a gene expression profile similar to that of activated CD8+ TRM cells, though they had lower expression levels of cytotoxicity-related genes. Both resting and activated CD8+ TRM cells in psoriatic lesions showed enhanced interaction strength in terms of signal transmission and reception compared with non-lesions. Activated CD8+ TRM cells were densely infiltrated in the dermis of skin lesions, while resting CD8+ TRM cells were located deeper in the dermis of non-lesion areas. TCR clones that were highly expanded in skin lesions were predominantly CD8+ TRM cells. Distinct TCR clusters showed different gene expression signatures, with one CD8+ TRM cluster expressing IFNγ and another expressing IL-17. These findings provide a valuable resource for further investigation into the pathogenesis of psoriasis by offering insights into the immune cell dynamics within both circulation and local skin environments.">

        <tr id="Background: Long-COVID disease, is a term that describes the persistent SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, is challenging to diagnose due to its complexity and incompleteness of pathogenesis. Although numerous factors were explored with this condition, the Galanin (GAL) and its receptor 1 (GalR-1) were not extensively studied in this context. Galanin system engaged in the pathophysiology of multiple chronic aging-related diseases, including alcoholism, inflammatory conditions of bowel and skin, and chronic pain. The presented study aimed to evaluate the relationship between tested Galanin system parameters in Long-COVID patients. 
Methods: The amount of GAL and GALR-1 were measured using the ELISA technique in a group of (90) Long-COVID patients and (60) individuals who had healing and were no longer experiencing symptoms of Long-COVID. 
Results: The study reported that Galanin, GalR-1, and Gal/GalR-1 ratio were significantly increased in Long-COVID patients. The study reported statistically higher Galanin levels (p<0.001), higher GALR1 levels (p = 0.007) and higher Gal/GalR1 ratios (p=0.019) in individuals diagnosed with Long-COVID patients and non-patients. According to the ROC analysis, Galanin showed the highest sensitivity (71.7%) followed by GALR1 (60.0%) to discriminate patients from non-patients. 
Conclusion: The findings suggest a direct relationship between Galanin and GALR1 with Long-COVID disease. However, further studies are needed to clarify the precise role of plasma Galanin(GAL) and its receptors(GalR-1) in Long-COVID pathology.">

Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) of the spleen may represent one such complication that merits further investigation. We describe the case of a patient, who was under long-term treatment with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and developed an inflammatory mass in the spleen, accompanied by systemic manifestations. This occurred with a history of four doses of nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) vaccination for COVID-19 and shortly after a SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Histologic examination of the splenectomy specimen supported by a large array of immunohistochemical stains and subsequent clinicopathological correlation indicated the diagnosis of splenic IPT in an immunologically altered background, due to modifying medication, immunization, and infection. Our case speculates that IPT may represent an adverse event related to immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, following antigen exposure (at first by sequential modRNA COVID-19 vaccinations and additionally by natural infection), despite the potentially protective effect of treatment with a TNFi.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, triggers a complex immune response, with T regulatory cells (Tregs) playing a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation. The current study investigates the function of T regulatory cells during COVID-19 infection and the subsequent recovery period, emphasizing their impact on immune regulation and inflammation control. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Treg subpopulations in peripheral blood samples from COVID-19 patients at different stages: acute infection, early convalescence, and long-term recovery. Flow cytometry was employed to quantify Tregs including “naïve”, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector cells (TEMRA). Additionally, the functional state of the Tregs was assessed by the expression of purinergic signaling molecules (CD39, CD73). Cytokine profiles were assessed through multiplex analysis. Our findings indicate a significant decrease in the number of Tregs during the acute phase of COVID-19, which correlates with heightened inflammatory markers and increased disease severity. Specifically, we found a decrease in the relative numbers of “naïve” and an increase in EM Tregs, as well as a decrease in the absolute numbers of “naïve” and CM Tregs. During the early convalescent period, the absolute counts of all Treg populations tended to increase, accompanied by a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite this, one year after recovery, the decreased subpopulations of regulatory T cells had not yet reached the levels observed in healthy donors. Finally, we observed the re-establishment of CD39 expression in all Treg subsets; however, there was no change in CD73 expression among Tregs. Understanding these immunological changes across different T regulatory subsets and adenosine signaling pathways offers important insights into the disease’s pathogenesis and provides a broader view of immune system dynamics during recovery.">

        <tr id="Persistent viral infections are associated with long-term health issues and prolonged transmission. How external perturbations after initial exposure affect the duration of infection is unclear. We discovered that murine astrovirus, an enteric RNA virus, persists indefinitely when mice remain unperturbed but is cleared rapidly after cage change. Besides eliminating the external viral reservoir, cage change also induced a transcriptional defense response in the intestinal epithelium. We further identified that displacing infected animals initially caused a temporary period of immune suppression through the stress hormone corticosterone, which was followed by an immune rebound characterized by an increase in CD8 T cells responsible for the epithelial antiviral responses. Our findings show how viral persistence can be disrupted by preventing re-exposure and activating immunity upon stress recovery, indicating that external factors can be manipulated to shorten the duration of a viral infection.">

 Background:
 COVID-19, a respiratory infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is increasingly recognized for its potential to induce a range of persistent symptoms known as “Long COVID.” The pathophysiology of this post-acute sequelae is intricate, involving a convergence of viral and host factors. Specifically, thrombotic microangiopathy, endothelial inflammation, hyperactivated platelets, and fibrin-like microthrombi are among the coagulation and vascular abnormalities that can affect every organ system. Despite the significance of these coagulation disturbances, there remains a critical need for a clearer understanding of the duration and pivotal transitions of post-infection coagulation abnormalities. To address this gap, this study aims to evaluate the long-term coagulation changes in patients following COVID-19 infection to understand the key turning points in the progression of coagulation abnormalities post-infection and the enduring impact on patient health.
 Methods:
 This study included a cohort of 1,473 hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 18 years and older, excluding individuals with active malignancies undergoing chemotherapy or severe hematological disorders. For comparative analysis, a control group consisting of 2,310 non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients was established. Comprehensive clinical information and laboratory data were collected at multiple time points: baseline (acute phase), 1, 2, 3, 4-6, and 7-12 months post-infection. The data encompassed inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8), as well as coagulation parameters such as prothrombin time (PT), prothrombin activity (PTA), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products (FDPs), D-dimer, antithrombin III (AT-III) and platelet count. Statistical analyses to compare differences in laboratory indicators between groups were conducted using independent samples t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, depending on data distribution. Longitudinal data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to assess changes in inflammatory markers and coagulation parameters over time.
 Results:
 In the acute phase of COVID-19, patients exhibited significant hematological and inflammatory disturbances, including reduced lymphocyte counts (p<0.001), elevated ESR (p<0.001), and increased IL-6 levels (p=0.001). Coagulation abnormalities were pronounced, with decreased platelet counts , prolonged PT, reduced PTA, elevated fibrinogen , increased D-dimer and FDPs , alongside decreased AT-III activity (all p<0.001), suggesting a consumptive coagulopathy linked to the inflammatory response.
 Longitudinal analysis revealed that while lymphocyte counts returned to normal by one month (p<0.001), LDH levels remained elevated for up to two months (p<0.001). The recovery of coagulation function was significantly delayed. Prolongations in PT (p=0.013), INR (p=0.008), and PTR (p=0.012), along with reduced PTA (p=0.001), persisted for two months, indicating a gradual but incomplete normalization and a reduced bleeding risk. FDP levels (p=0.017) normalized by three months, while abnormalities in TT (p=0.008) extended beyond six months. Despite a significant decrease in D-dimer levels by three months (p=0.001), 66.96% of patients still had abnormal D-dimer levels at 12 months, reflecting ongoing microthrombotic activity and hyperfibrinolysis. Additionally, platelet count decrease persisted beyond 12 months, indicating sustained consumption. Correspondingly, ESR levels decreased significantly by two months (p<0.001) yet remained abnormal in 57.31% of patients at 12 months.
 Conclusion:
 This study highlights persistent coagulation abnormalities and a slow recovery of coagulation function in COVID-19 patients, extending up to a year post-infection. These findings underscore the importance of continued monitoring and potential therapeutic interventions to manage the long-term risks associated with coagulation dysfunction in patients with Long COVID. This work provides crucial insights into the prolonged nature of these abnormalities and their implications for clinical practice, particularly in managing thrombotic risks.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients.We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex.Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection.These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Monocyte‐derived macrophages and microglia initially adopt an anti‐inflammatory phenotype following stroke but later transition to a pro‐inflammatory state. The mechanisms underlying this phenotypic shift remain unclear. This study investigates the activation dynamics of molecular signaling pathways in macrophages and microglia after stroke. Methods We utilized publicly available single‐cell RNA sequencing datasets to examine the activation dynamics of molecular signaling pathways alongside the pro‐inflammatory phenotype of macrophages and microglia. Male C57BL/6 mice underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), with the STING inhibitor H151 administered to tMCAO mice. Neurobehavioral performance was assessed using rotarod, foot fault, novel object recognition, and water maze tests at 5‐, 7‐, 10‐, and 14‐days post‐stroke. Primary microglia and bone marrow‐derived macrophages were cultured for in vitro experiments. Results Single‐cell sequencing data indicated that the activation of STING and subsequent type I interferon signaling drove the phenotypic shift of microglia and macrophages toward a pro‐inflammatory state in the stroke lesion. Immunostaining demonstrated that the emergence of pro‐inflammatory microglia and macrophages aligned with the activation time course of STING and type I interferon signaling. Continuous phagocytosis by macrophages and microglia led to STING activation, which triggered type I interferon signaling and promoted the phenotypic shift. Inhibition of STING signaling prevented this transition, reduced neuroinflammation, and conferred protection against ischemic stroke. Conclusion These findings elucidated the critical role of STING‐mediated type I interferon signaling in driving post‐stroke neuroinflammation and underscored the potential of STING inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for alleviating neuroinflammatory responses following stroke.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Taste dysfunction is a frequent symptom of acute coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). While the majority of those affected reported recovery over time, emerging data suggest that 20–25% of individuals experience persistent taste dysfunction, constituting a common symptom of long COVID. Gustation is mediated by continuously renewing taste bud cells. A balance between the counteracting processes of cell generation and cell death maintains the homeostatic turnover. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is a morphogenic protein that promotes taste cell proliferation and differentiation. Enzymatic proteins such as gustin modulate the environment around the taste receptors and influence taste perception. Hence, we hypothesized that increased taste cell turnover and reduced taste-related salivary proteins contribute to the taste dysfunction in long COVID. Methods: Unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) was collected from individuals with long COVID experiencing taste dysfunction after obtaining informed consent. The normal control included archived saliva samples catalogued prior to 2019. Taste perception was objectively determined by the waterless empirical taste test. The SHH, gustin, and inflammatory cytokines in UWS were determined with ELISA. The expressions of epithelial and taste-cell-specific markers in cellular saliva were assessed by immunoflurorescence. Results: Impaired bitter taste was the most common dysfunction in the long-COVID cohort. Salivary gustin was significantly lower in those with long COVID and correlated with lower bitter taste score. Cellular saliva showed keratin-10- and small-proline-rich protein-positive epithelial cells as well as SHH-, occluding- and KCNQ1-positive taste cells. Conclusions: Salivary gustin could be a marker for impaired bitter taste in long COVID.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anosmia, anxiety, depression, stress-related reactions, and psychoses. The illness can cause persistent cognitive impairment and "brain fog", suggesting chronic brain involvement. Clinical entities of ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 and Post COVID Syndrome (PCS) mainly present neuropsychiatric symptoms such as dysgeusia, headache, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related brain damage is unclear, but it is linked to various mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, impaired glutamate homeostasis, glial and glymphatic damage, and hippocampal degeneration. Noteworthy is that the metabotropic receptor mGluR2 was discovered as a mechanism of internalisation of SARS-CoV-2 in Central Nervous System (CNS) cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) are two supplements that have already been found effective in treating psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, NAC showed evidence in relieving cognitive symptomatology in PCS, and ALC was found effective in treating depressive symptomatology of PCS. The overlapping effects on the glutamatergic system of ALC and NAC could help treat COVID-19 psychiatric symptoms and PCS, acting through different mechanisms on the xc-mGluR2 network, with potentially synergistic effects on chronic pain and neuro-astrocyte protection. This paper aims to summarise the current evidence on the potential therapeutic role of NAC and ALC, providing an overview of the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology. It proposes a pathophysiological model explaining the effectiveness of NAC and ALC in treating COVID-19-related neuropsychiatric symptoms.">

        <tr id="HIV-1 enters the central nervous system (CNS) early in infection, and a significant proportion of people with HIV experience CNS complications despite anti-retroviral therapy. Chronic immune dysfunction, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and viral proteins like Tat and gp120 released by HIV-1-infected immune cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). To elucidate the contribution of non-viral factors to CNS complications in people with HIV-1, a comparative analysis of neurovirulent subtype B (HIV-1ADA) and non-neurovirulent subtype C (HIV-1Indie-C1) isolates was performed. Culture supernatants from HIV-1-infected PBMCs, either with or without immunodepletion of Tat and gp120, were used to treat SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. HIV-1ADA-infected PBMC media showed significantly higher cytotoxicity than HIV-1IndieC1-infected PBMC media, notwithstanding the depletion of Tat and gp120, highlighting the role of non-viral factors contributing to neurotoxicity. A comparison of inflammatory profiles revealed that HIV-1ADA media contained elevated levels of cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, IP10). Given the involvement of Tat in upregulating immune mediators, PBMCs from healthy subjects were treated with recombinant purified Tat from subtype B or C. Subtype B Tat induced a stronger inflammatory response than subtype C Tat. These results confirm that both viral and non-viral immune factors mediate neuronal damage in people with HIV.">

        <tr id="Disease-associated microglia (DAM) are observed in neurodegenerative diseases, demyelinating disorders, and aging. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and evolutionary trajectory of DAM during the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain unclear. Using a mouse model of ALS that expresses a human SOD1 gene mutation, we found that the microglia subtype DAM begins to appear following motor neuron degeneration, primarily in the brain stem and spinal cord. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNAscope in situ hybridization, and flow cytometry, we found that DAM increased in number as the disease progressed, reaching their peak in the late disease stage. DAM responded to disease progression in both SOD1G93A mice and sporadic ALS and C9orf72-mutated patients. Motor neuron loss in SOD1G93A mice exhibited 2 accelerated phases: P90 to P110 (early stage) and P130 to P150 (late stage). Some markers were synchronized with the accelerated phase of motor neuron loss, suggesting that these proteins may be particularly responsive to disease progression. Through pseudotime trajectory analysis, we tracked the dynamic transition of homeostatic microglia into DAM and cluster 6 microglia. Interestingly, we used the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 to deplete microglia in SOD1G93A mice and observed that DAM survival is independent of CSF1R. An in vitro phagocytosis assay directly confirmed that DAM could phagocytose more beads than other microglia subtypes. These findings reveal that the induction of the DAM phenotype is a shared cross-species and cross-subtype characteristic in ALS. Inducing the DAM phenotype and enhancing its function during the early phase of disease progression, or the time window between P130 and P150 where motor neuron loss slows, could serve as a neuroprotective strategy for ALS.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 can trigger hyperinflammation, leading to severe COVID-19, presenting with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure. Specific biomarkers like leukocytes, CRP, NLR, AST, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin, and IL-6 are associated with disease severity. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, has been proposed to mitigate hyperinflammation, but its clinical efficacy remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Anakinra on inflammatory biomarkers, oxygenation status, and survival outcomes in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (according to the National Institute of Health severity scale), compared to standard treatment. Methods: A retrospective analysis included 65 patients (mean age 75.51 ± 9.54 years; 58.5% male, 41.5% female) hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. Patients were divided into two groups: a control group receiving standard treatment (n = 24) and a target group treated with Anakinra (n = 41). Biomarkers and oxygenation status were assessed on Days 0, 3, and 7. Statistical analyses compared the groups for changes in leukocytes, NLR, CRP, AST, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin, and IL-6. Results: Anakinra treatment was associated with significant reductions in leukocytes, NLR, D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6, and CRP by Days 3 and 7. Improvements in oxygenation status were observed, although no survival benefits were noted. The control group showed no significant biomarker changes except for AST and LDH on Day 7. Conclusions: Anakinra demonstrated favorable effects on biomarkers and oxygenation in moderate to severe COVID-19 but did not improve survival. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.">

Within the first week, we identify 70 kinetic patterns in 45 cellular clusters, majority of which discriminate between the two formulations, some in a tissue and sex-specific manner. Intriguingly, differential transcripts fall into two categories, one whose association with YF17D or InYF is maintained even when decoupled from their cell-type of expression and the other where such cell-plus-gene pairing is critical to maintain differential marker status. We demonstrate applications of this resource, by identifying B cells with varied interferon and antigen responsiveness in relation to each vaccine.

        <tr id="Thrombin promotes the proliferation and function of CD8+ T cells. To test if thrombin prevents exhaustion and sustains antiviral T cell activity during chronic viral infection, we depleted the thrombin-precursor prothrombin to 10% of normal levels in mice prior to infection with the clone 13 strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Unexpectedly, prothrombin insufficiency resulted in 100% mortality after infection that was prevented by depletion of CD8+ T cells, suggesting that reduced availability of prothrombin enhances virus-induced immunopathology. Yet, the number, function, and apparent exhaustion of virus-specific T cells were measurably unaffected by prothrombin depletion. Histological analysis of the lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, and brain did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or increased tissue damage in low prothrombin mice that could explain mortality. Viral loads were also similar in infected mice regardless of prothrombin levels. Instead, infection of prothrombin-depleted mice resulted in a severe, T cell-dependent anemia associated with increased hemolysis. Thus, thrombin plays an unexpected protective role in preventing hemolytic anemia during virus infection, with potential implications for patients who are using direct thrombin inhibitors as an anticoagulant therapy.">

        <tr id="Abnormal lipid metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was first documented by Alois Alzheimer in his early observations of patients with a then unrecognized brain disease, which he noted was characterized by a significant presence of “adipose inclusions” or “lipoid granules”. Despite this early recognition, until recently the significance of abnormal lipid metabolism in AD has been largely overlooked by the scientific community for decades, highlighting a critical gap in our understanding of this complex disease. In the past decade, numerous loci and genes with genome-wide significant evidence of affecting AD risk have been reported. Notably, a significant portion of these AD risk genes are either preferentially or exclusively expressed by microglia in the brain and/or code for enzymes that directly or indirectly regulate lipid metabolism. This suggests a major, yet uncharacterized, role of microglia in modulating brain lipid metabolism under AD pathological conditions. In our study, we dissected microglia-dependent and independent regulation of lipid metabolism in an AD-like mouse model of amyloidosis, 5xFAD, taking advantage of pharmacological and genetic interventions to eliminate microglia. Using multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics (MDMS-SL), we identified overt changes in a number of AD-associated lipids (ADALs) in postmortem patient brains and mouse models of amyloidosis. This included bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP), a lipid class enriched in endosomal/lysosomal compartments, and the two most abundant classes of lysophospholipids: lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), which are commonly associated with inflammation. Our findings revealed that microglial depletion prevented the accumulation of arachidonic acid-containing BMP species, which are associated with lysosomal activation induced by amyloidosis via a mechanism that involves progranulin, coded by AD risk gene GRN, as shown by targeted transcriptomics, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. Surprisingly, AD-associated LPC and LPE accumulation was not driven by microglia. Instead, LPC accumulation correlated with astrocytic activation, while LPE accumulation seems to be associated with oxidative stress. In summary, we uncovered novel microglia-dependent and independent mechanisms that drive lipid dysregulation in AD. These findings may be mechanistically linked with the early glial lipoid deposits described by Dr. Alzheimer. Graphical Abstract.">

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder for which there are currently no effective treatment options. Increasing evidence suggests that AD is a systemic disease closely associated with the immune system, not merely a central nervous system (CNS) disorder. Immune cells play crucial roles in the onset and progression of AD. Microglia and astrocytes are the primary inflammatory cells in the brain that can sensitively detect changes in the internal environment and transform into different phenotypes to exert differing effects at various stages of AD. Peripheral immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils can also be recruited to the CNS to mediate the inflammatory response in AD. As such, investigating the role of immune cells in AD is particularly important for elucidating its specific pathogenesis. This review primarily discusses the roles of central innate immune cells, peripheral immune cells, and the interactions between central and peripheral immune cells in the development of neuroinflammation in AD. Furthermore, we listed clinical trials targeting AD-associated neuroinflammation, which may represent a promising direction for developing effective treatments for AD in the future.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with a complex and not fully understood etiopathological background involving inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. CHI3L1 has been implicated in pathological conditions such as inflammation, injury, and neurodegeneration, and is likely to play a role in the physiological development of the CNS. CHI3L1 is primarily produced by CNS macrophages, microglia, and activated astrocytes. The CHI3L1 expression pattern in MS lesions might support the important role of astrocytes in modulating inflammatory processes in this disease. The potential applications of CHI3L1 as a biomarker in MS are multifactorial. The measurement of CHI3L1 in body fluids might find its role in the early diagnosis of MS. In further stages, the monitoring of CHI3L1 levels might provide information on disease severity and progression, enabling a better adjustment of therapeutic strategies. Importantly, CHI3L1 might potentially serve as a marker of ongoing glial activation, reflecting the dynamic response of the CNS cells to the inflammatory processes in MS. Although preliminary findings have been promising, further research is needed to validate the utility of CHI3L1 measurements in the diagnosis and prediction of the progression of MS. Additionally, comparisons with other biomarkers might be useful in clinical practice.">

IP inhibition using ONX-0914 did not affect MHV-1 replication in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in vitro. IP inhibition in vivo exacerbated virus-induced weight loss and mortality but had no effect on virus replication in lungs or livers. IP inhibition had minimal effect on virus-induced pulmonary inflammation but led to substantially increased liver pathology, including greater upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and histological evidence of inflammation and necrosis. Those findings were associated with evidence of increased endoplasmic reticulum stress although not with accumulation of ubiquitinated protein. Our results indicate that the IP is a protective host factor during acute MHV-1 infection.


IMPORTANCE
Inflammatory responses triggered by acute infection by respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) drive morbidity and mortality. Infection of mice with murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1), a mouse coronavirus, is a useful model to study the pathogenesis of coronavirus respiratory infections. The immunoproteasome is an inducible component of the ubiquitin proteasome system that is poised to contribute to multiple aspects of immune function, inflammation, and protein homeostasis during an infection. We used the MHV-1 model to define the role of the immunoproteasome in coronavirus pathogenesis. We found that immunoproteasome subunit expression increases in the lungs and the liver during acute MHV-1 respiratory infection. Inhibition of immunoproteasome activity did not affect MHV-1 replication but increased MHV-1-induced weight loss, mortality, and inflammation in lungs and livers. Thus, our findings indicate that the immunoproteasome is a critical protective host factor during coronavirus respiratory infection.">

        <tr id="A shared hallmark of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is the chronic activation of innate immune cells, which actively contributes to the neurodegenerative process. In Alzheimer’s disease, this inflammatory milieu exacerbates both amyloid and tau pathology. A similar abnormal inflammatory response has been reported in Parkinson’s disease, with elevated levels of cytokines and other inflammatory intermediates derived from activated glial cells, which promote the progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Understanding the causes that support this aberrant inflammatory response has become a topic of growing interest and research in neurodegeneration, with high translational potential. It has been postulated that the phenotypic shift of immune cells towards a proinflammatory state combined with the presence of immunogenic cell death fuels a vicious cycle in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role. Mitochondria and mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species are downstream effectors of different inflammatory signaling pathways, including inflammasomes. Dysfunctional mitochondria are also recognized as important producers of damage-associated molecular patterns, which can amplify the immune response. Here, we review the major findings highlighting the role of mitochondria as a checkpoint of neuroinflammation and immunogenic cell deaths in neurodegenerative diseases. The knowledge of these processes may help to find new druggable targets to modulate the inflammatory response.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms underlying pathological changes in the central nervous system (CNS) following Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) infection have not yet been elucidated. IFN-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) is often used as a predictive factor to monitor early virus infection. It has also been reported that IP-10 plays a pivotal role in neuroinflammation. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of IP-10 in the neuropathogenesis of CV-A16 infection. We observed that the level of IP-10, as well as the TLR3-TRIF-TRAF3-TBK1-NF-κB and RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS-TRAFS-TBK1-NF-κB pathways, which are the upstream of IP-10, were significantly elevated during the course of CV-A16 infection. This increase was accompanied by an increase in a series of inflammatory cytokines at different time-points during CV-A16 infection. To determine whether IP-10 influences BBB integrity, we examined junctional complexes. Our results revealed that the expression levels of Claudin5, Occludin, ZO-1 and VE-Cadherin were notably decreased in CV-A16-infected HUVECs, but these indicators were restored in CV-A16-infected HUVECs with Eldelumab treatment. Nevertheless, IP-10 is only a chemokine that primarily traffics CXCR3-positive immune cells to inflammatory sites or promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, the interactions between IP-10 and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Our data revealed that IP-10 mediated the production of TNF-α, which was also observed to change the junctional complexes. Moreover, in a suckling mouse model, IP-10 and TNF-α treatments exacerbated clinical symptoms, mortality and pathological changes in the brain of CV-A16-infected mice, but Anti-IP-10 and Anti-TNF-α treatments alleviated these changes. Our data also revealed that IP-10 may be detected early in CV-A16 infection, whereas TNF-α was detected late in CV-A16 infection, and the production of TNF-α was also found to be positively correlated with IP-10. In addition, IP-10 and TNF-α were observed to reduce junctional complexes and enhance virus entry into the CNS. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that CV-A16 activates the IP-10/TNF-α regulatory axis to cause BBB damage and accelerate the formation of neuroinflammation in infected hosts, which not only provides a new understanding of the neuropathogenesis caused by CV-A16, but also offers a promising target for the development of CV-A16 antiviral drugs.">

        <tr id="Transcription of interferons upon viral infection is critical for cell-intrinsic innate immunity. This process is influenced by many host and viral factors. To identify host factors that modulate interferon induction within cells infected by influenza A virus, we developed CRISPR with Transcriptional Readout (CRITR-seq). CRITR-seq is a method linking CRISPR guide sequence to activity at a promoter of interest. Employing this method, we find that depletion of the Negative Elongation Factor complex increases both flu transcription and interferon expression. We find that the process of flu transcription, both in the presence and absence of viral replication, is a key contributor to interferon induction. Taken together, our findings highlight innate immune ligand concentration as a limiting factor in triggering an interferon response, identify NELF as an important interface with the flu life cycle, and validate CRITR-seq as a tool for genome-wide screens for phenotypes of gene expression.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex and dynamic response of the central nervous system (CNS) to injury, infection, and disease. While acute neuroinflammation plays a protective role by facilitating pathogen clearance and tissue repair, chronic and dysregulated inflammation contributes significantly to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. This review explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and peripheral immune cells. Key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the NLRP3 inflammasome, are discussed alongside emerging regulators such as non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications, and the gut–brain axis. The therapeutic landscape is evolving, with traditional anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs and corticosteroids offering limited efficacy in chronic conditions. Immunomodulators, gene and RNA-based therapeutics, and stem cell methods have all shown promise for more specific and effective interventions. Additionally, the modulation of metabolic states and gut microbiota has emerged as a novel strategy to regulate neuroinflammation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinically viable therapies. Future studies should concentrate on integrated, interdisciplinary methods to reduce chronic neuroinflammation and slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, providing opportunities for revolutionary advances in CNS therapies.">

        <tr id="ISG15, an IFN-stimulated gene, plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses during viral infections. Its upregulation is part of the host's defense mechanism against viruses, contributing to the antiviral state of cells. However, altered ISG15 expression can also lead to immune dysregulation and pathological outcomes, particularly during persistent viral infections. Understanding the balance of ISG15 in promoting antiviral immunity while avoiding immune-mediated pathology is essential for developing targeted therapeutic interventions against viral diseases. In this article, using Usp18-deficient, USP18 enzymatic-inactive and Isg15-deficient mouse models, we report that a lack of USP18 enzymatic function during persistent viral infection leads to severe immune pathology characterized by hematological disruptions described by reductions in platelets, total WBCs, and lymphocyte counts; pulmonary cytokine amplification; lung vascular leakage; and death. The lack of Usp18 in myeloid cells mimicked the pathological manifestations observed in Usp18-/- mice and required Isg15. Mechanistically, interrupting the enzymes that conjugate/deconjugate ISG15, using Uba7-/- or Usp18C61A mice, respectively, led to accumulation of ISG15 that was accompanied by inflammatory neutrophil accumulation, lung pathology, and death similar to that observed in Usp18-deficient mice. Moreover, myeloid cell depletion reversed pathological manifestations, morbidity, and mortality in Usp18C61A mice. Our results suggest that dysregulated ISG15 production and signaling during persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection can produce lethal immune pathology and could serve as a therapeutic target during severe viral infections with pulmonary pathological manifestations.">

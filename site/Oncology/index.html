        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Factors regulating the severity of pneumonitis during viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found higher expression of protein S (PROS1) in lung epithelium of mild compared to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We hypothesized that PROS1 may protect the upper airways by regulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods To test this, in vitro air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary healthy human lung epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2. This model, validated through immunofluorescent staining, confocal microscopy, and single-cell RNA-sequencing, replicated pathogenic changes seen in the lungs of COVID-19. Regulation and secretion of PROS1, along with multiple soluble mediators, were quantified in control and infected cultures using ELISAs. Results We found that PROS1 is present in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium and is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection through an IFN-mediated process. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PROS1 downregulated the SARS-CoV-2-induced proinflammatory phenotypes of basal cells, transforming pathogenic CXCL10/11high into a regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 increased the secretion of M-CSF from epithelial cells, which induced the expression of PROS1 receptor MERTK on monocytes interacting with the lung epithelium. PROS1, in turn, shifted SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenic monocyte phenotypes toward a phenotype with increased MHC class II. Conclusion These findings highlight the crucial role of PROS1 in protecting against severe lung pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2, by reducing epithelial- and monocyte-derived inflammation, promoting pro-repair epithelial phenotypes, and enhancing antigen presentation in myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) syndrome or “Long COVID” represents a widespread health challenge that necessitates the development of novel diagnostic approaches and targeted therapies that can be readily deployed. Immune dysregulation has been reported as one of the hallmarks of PASC, but the extent of PASC immune dysregulation in patients over time remains unclear. We therefore assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, peripheral immune cell profiles, autoantibody profiles and circulating cytokines for up to 6 months in participants with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who either convalesced or developed PASC. Compared to convalescent, PASC participants with a broad range of PASC phenotypes exhibited persistently elevated IgG titers for SARS-CoV-2 Envelope and Nucleocapsid proteins over the 6 months of study duration. In contrast, the IgG responses to Spike protein were significantly lower in the PASC cohort with predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 class-switched bias. Using CyTOF analysis, we show elevated numbers of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) and mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT), which also correlated with high anti-Envelope IgG titers. Persistent immune activation was accompanied by augmented serum cytokine profiles with LIF, IL-11, Eotaxin-3, and HMGB-1 in PASC participants, who also demonstrated significantly higher rates of autoantibodies. These findings highlight the persistence of immune dysregulation in PASC, underscoring the need to explore targeted therapies addressing viral persistence, dysregulated antibody production, and autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="While human autopsy samples have provided insights into pulmonary immune mechanisms associated with severe viral respiratory diseases, the mechanisms that contribute to a clinically favorable resolution of viral respiratory infections remain unclear due to the lack of proper experimental systems. Using mice co-engrafted with a genetically matched human immune system and fetal lung xenograft (fLX), we mapped the immunological events defining successful resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues. Viral infection is rapidly cleared from fLX following a peak of viral replication, histopathological manifestations of lung disease and loss of AT2 program, as reported in human COVID-19 patients. Infection resolution is associated with the activation of a limited number of hematopoietic subsets, including inflammatory monocytes and CD3-expressing macrophage-like cells, which are highly enriched in viral RNA and dissipate upon infection resolution. Specific human fibroblast and endothelial subsets also elicit robust antiviral and monocyte chemotaxis signatures, respectively. Notably, systemic depletion of human CD4 + cells, but not CD3 + cells, significantly abrogates infection resolution in fLX and induces persistent infection, supporting the dominant role of peripheral CD4 + monocytes over T-cells in the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings unravel a comprehensive picture of the immunological events defining effective resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues, revealing markedly divergent immunological trajectories between resolving and fatal COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to study how human immune responses develop to a novel viral antigen delivered through different vaccine platforms. However, to date, no study has directly compared immune responses to all three FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines at single-cell multi-omic resolution. We longitudinally profiled SARS-CoV-2–naïve adults (n=31) vaccinated with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S, integrating plasma cytokines, antibody titers, and single-cell multi-omic data (DOGMA-seq). We discovered a distinct, transient interferon program (ISG-dim) that emerged specifically 1–2 days after the first mRNA dose in ~10% of myeloid cells. This state was characterized by ISGF3 complex activation and its target genes (e.g., MX1, MX2, DDX58), with transcriptional and epigenetic profiles distinct from the robust interferon program observed after mRNA boosting or a single Ad26.COV2.S dose (ISG-high). In vitro stimulation of human monocytes showed that IFN-α alone recapitulates ISG-dim, whereas both IFN-α and IFN-γ are required for ISG-high. These findings define dose-dependent interferon programming in human myeloid cells, highlight mechanistic differences between priming and boosting, with implications for optimizing vaccine platform choice, dose scheduling, and formulation.">

Understanding age-associated differences in acute and memory adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and how this contributes to more favorable outcomes in children is critically important.


METHODS
We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell, B cell, and antibody responses in 329 peripheral blood samples collected from non-hospitalized children, adolescents, and adults at three timepoints, including acute and memory timepoints.


RESULTS
Most children produced robust CD4+ T cell responses during infection and developed memory CD4+ T cells; however, young children <4 years old often had undetectable CD4+ T cell responses compared to older children and adults. Young children also generated reduced frequencies of memory B cells; despite this, they mounted substantial and durable neutralizing antibody responses. CD4+ T cell responses in children were biased towards non-spike epitopes, especially in asymptomatic cases. Memory B cells in children were preferentially classical memory or, paradoxically, CXCR3+.


CONCLUSION
These findings support the concept that the kinetics and composition of T and B cell responses shift across age groups and may be associated with milder COVID-19 outcomes in children.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The Long COVID syndrome is a major global health problem, affecting approximately 10–20% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus with many remaining symptomatic beyond one year. Fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance and hyperlactataemia on minimal exertion have led to the suggestion of a bioenergetic defect. We hypothesised that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathological feature in Long COVID cases and would correlate with clinical outcome. Methods This prospective, case-controlled, observational study recruited 27 participants with an established diagnosis of Long COVID syndrome from a single tertiary clinic together with 16 age-matched controls aged 25–65 years. Seahorse-based mitochondrial flux analysis and bioenergetics profile of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed and correlated with clinical phenotype. Findings Long COVID cases had an increased baseline and ATP-induced oxygen consumption rate with a significant attenuation in tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate fluorescence response to oligomycin. Correlations were observed between mitochondrial function and autonomic health, quality of life and time from index infection. Sex-specific differences were also observed. Interpretation PBMCs from Long COVID subjects exhibit an exceptional and distinctive change in ATP synthase, as it contributes to the mitochondrial membrane potential rather than using it exclusively to generate ATP. The findings suggest that the enzyme runs both forward and reverse reactions, synthesising and hydrolysing ATP. The correlation of mitochondrial function with clinical phenotype in Long COVID may indicate a causal relationship and warrants further validation in larger scale studies.">

        <tr id="Sweet syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory skin disorder characterized by erythematous plaques with a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate. First-line therapy remains oral corticosteroids, which suppresses inflammation non-specifically. Although neutrophils are typically short-lived, how they persist in Sweet syndrome skin and contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized population of antigen-presenting cell (APC)-like neutrophils expressing MHC class II genes that are uniquely present in Sweet syndrome skin but absent from healthy tissue and circulation. Keratinocytes extended neutrophil lifespan 10-fold in co-culture experiments and drove the emergence of an APC-like phenotype in approximately 30% of neutrophils, mirroring observations in patient lesions. Mechanistically, keratinocyte-derived serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) signals through the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on neutrophils to promote their survival. These long-lived neutrophils actively orchestrate local immune responses by recruiting T cells and inducing cytokine production. Strikingly, dual blockade of SAA1-FPR2 signaling restores neutrophil turnover to baseline levels, with efficacy comparable to high-dose corticosteroids. These findings uncover a keratinocyte-neutrophil-T cell axis that sustains chronic inflammation in Sweet syndrome and highlight the SAA1/FPR2 pathway as a promising target for precision therapy.">

        <tr id="APOBEC3B (A3B) has been implicated in host–virus interactions, but its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that A3B is overexpressed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from severe COVID-19 patients compared to those with mild disease. A3B knockdown in Caco-2 cells significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, likely through attenuation of the PKR-mediated integrated stress response, a pathway proposed to promote SARS-CoV-2. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data suggest that BALF cells from severe COVID-19 patients exhibit a repressed state for cellular translation, potentially mediated by eIF2α phosphorylation. However, in A549-ACE2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 does not activate PKR, but A3B knockdown still reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action in different cellular contexts. To further investigate A3B’s role in severe COVID-19, we employed Geneformer, a transformer-based machine learning model, which predicted that A3B knockout would perturb AMPD2 (adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2), a key enzyme in purine metabolism and immune regulation. We validated this prediction using bulk RNA-seq and clinical scRNA-seq data, confirming that AMPD2 expression is downregulated in severe COVID-19 but restored upon A3B knockdown. Together, these findings suggest that A3B plays a proviral role in SARS-CoV-2 infection by modulating translational control and immune regulatory networks, warranting further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanistic details.">

We tested whether prior exposure of macaques to these immunogens protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lungs and found more efficient replication control after the pro-inflammatory immunity elicited by BCG. The decreased virus level in lungs was linked to early infiltrates of classical monocytes producing IL-8 with systemic neutrophils, Th2 cells, and Ki67+CD95+CD4+ T cells producing CCR7. At the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, BCG-treated animals had higher frequencies of lung infiltrating neutrophils and higher CD14+ cells expressing efferocytosis marker MERTK, responses correlating with decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung. At the same time point, plasma IL-18, TNF-α, TNFSF-10, and VEGFA levels were also higher in the BCG group and correlated with decreased virus replication. Finally, after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, decreased virus replication correlated with neutrophils producing IL-10 and CCR7 preferentially recruited to the lungs of BCG-vaccinated animals. These data point to the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of functional monocytes and neutrophils in controlling SARS-CoV-2 levels and suggest a central role of monocyte efferocytosis in curbing replication.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often-fatal neurodegenerative disease, is caused by the neuroinvasive polyomavirus JCPyV. Peripheral organs, including the kidney, are the site of lifelong persistent infections that are asymptomatic. In a subset of immunosuppressed or immunomodulated patients, the virus invades the central nervous system infecting oligodendrocytes, which leads to the multifocal white matter disease known as PML. The mechanisms that lead to neuroinvasion by JCPyV have not been well described. The brain is protected from viruses and other pathogens by physiological barriers, including the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and the blood-brain barrier. To better understand the mechanism by which the virus breaches these barriers, we focused our attention on studying virus interactions with pericytes, which are an essential component of the blood-brain barrier. We found that the virus binds to pericytes in a receptor-dependent manner and that pericytes are susceptible to JCPyV infection. Previous work from our group demonstrated that JCPyV was capable of penetrating an intact endothelial cell barrier. Once across the endothelium, JCPyV would come in direct contact with pericytes, and we hypothesize pericyte infection would amplify and facilitate robust penetration into the brain parenchyma. This is the first demonstration that pericytes, a principal component of the blood-brain barrier, are susceptible to the neuroinvasive human polyomavirus JCPyV. IMPORTANCE JCPyV infects at least half the adult population worldwide. An asymptomatic, persistent infection is typically established in the kidney and possibly other peripheral organs. In immunosuppressed individuals, the virus can reactivate and cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a deadly disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The pathogenic route the virus takes from the periphery to the CNS is unknown. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that JCPyV can infect human cerebrovascular pericytes, a cell type that contributes to the blood-brain barrier. This observation suggests that the virus could use the pericytes as a means to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to reach its pathogenic targets in the brain parenchyma.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Adults and children often respond differently to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with adults facing a higher risk of symptomatic and severe illness. We hypothesize that children's protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 may be due to more frequent respiratory viral infections, which prime their airway antiviral defenses.


METHODS
Using case-cohort and case-control analyses in the Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 cohort, we evaluated whether infection with common respiratory viruses protects against SARS-CoV-2 infections and investigated airway molecular mechanisms by which this protection is achieved. We tested 10,493 longitudinal nasal swabs from 1,156 participants for 21 respiratory pathogens. We performed RNA-sequencing on 147 swabs (N=144 participants) collected prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and 391 swabs (N=165 participants) during and before rhinovirus infection.


RESULTS
Participants with rhinovirus infection in the previous 30 days were at 48% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR:0.52, p=0.034). Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, recent rhinovirus infection was associated with 9.6-fold lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p=0.0031). Higher pre-infection expression of 57 genes was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load, including 24 antiviral defense genes; 22 of these were induced by rhinovirus infections. Relative to adults, children expressed higher levels of the antiviral gene signature (p=0.014) and were at 2.2-fold increased risk for rhinovirus infections.


CONCLUSIONS
Rhinovirus infections, which trigger increased expression of antiviral airway genes, are linked to a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Frequent rhinovirus infections may enhance this protective gene profile, partially explaining why children experience milder SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to adults.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on over 29,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Angus cattle stratified by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), a proxy for the cellular immune response (Cell-IR). Unsupervised clustering identified major immune populations including CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Differential gene expression suggests that low Cell-IR cattle have in elevated NKT inflammatory response, while high Cell-IR cattle have increased CD8- γδ T cell and pro-inflammatory myeloid activity. Intercellular communication analysis using CellChat highlighted pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, particularly the IL-1β– IL-1R1 ligand-receptor interactions. This study provides a high-resolution atlas of Angus PBMCs and establishes a framework for linking immune cell composition with functional immune phenotypes in cattle.

Despite its substantial global health impact, the biological mechanisms underlying PCC remain poorly understood, underscoring the need for validated animal models. Methods To address this, we conducted a longitudinal study using the golden Syrian hamster model, integrating virological, immunological, histopathological, and behavioral analyses from the acute phase to 60 days post-inoculation. Results Our results showed persistent viral RNA, prolonged immune dysregulation, and behavioral changes that mirrored key features of human PCC. Discussion Although fully reproducing PCC in animal models is inherently challenging due to its complex and heterogeneous presentation in humans, the use of complementary models with distinct phenotypes is essential for elucidating its pathophysiology. These results aim to contribute valuable insights into the biological basis of PCC and support the development of targeted preventative and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Children with COVID-19 typically experience milder symptoms and lower hospitalization rates, though severe cases do occur. Understanding age-related immune responses is crucial for future preparedness. We characterized immune response dynamics to SARS-CoV-2 in 145 samples from 119 pediatric patients (<18 years) with confirmed infection, assessed at four distinct time points: <14 days, 14 days–3 months, 3–6 months, and 6–12 months post-infection. At infection, patients presented increased activated T-cells, higher levels of exhaustion (i.e., PD-1+), lower numbers of unswitched memory B-cells, and increased antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Both humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses increased over time (all patients showed measurable responses in the last assessment). Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients (58.6%) showed increased specific cellular responses from infection onwards, along with enriched memory B-cell subsets (but not ASCs), and distinct T-cell activation profiles. Children with severe disease were younger, predominantly boys, displayed altered T/B-cell ratios, and reduced PHA responses when infected. Compared to adolescents, younger children showed lower antibody titers and weaker cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2, possibly underlining the higher prevalence of severe manifestations in younger children. Our study illustrates important age-, gender-, and disease severity-dependent variations in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which can be helpful in improving patient management and immunization strategies adjusted to age groups.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the worst pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Studies have shown that severe COVID-19 patients have immune dysfunction. To characterize the dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and scV(D)J-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from mild, moderate, and severe patients. We observed that as the severity of the disease increased, several CD8 + T cell subsets and Treg cells continued to decrease, while CD4 + T subsets, natural killer cells and plasma cells continued to increase. Several aberrantly expressed biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity were identified. For example, RPS26 was down-regulated, while the ZFP36, IL-32, and IgM genes were up-regulated with increasing disease severity. Functional analysis showed multiple immune-related pathways, such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-10 production pathways, were dysregulated. As the disease severity increased, intercellular interactions fluctuated. Particularly, naive CD8 + T cells regulated memory and activated CD8 + T cells, and the weakening in Treg cells’ regulation of other immune cells was especially obvious. The expression of the MIF signaling pathway, mediated by CD74 + CXCR4, was higher throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection and the intensity of immune cell-cell interactions mediated by TGF-β was enhanced from mild to severe. Subsequently, scV(D)J-seq analysis showed a decreasing trend in the number of clonotypes, repertoire diversity and clonotypes overlap of monoclonal B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) as the SARS-CoV-2 progresses. The CDR3 sequence length in COVID-19-specific clonotypes showed a bias towards being longer as the severity of COVID-19 increases.

        <tr id="Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder often preceded by gastrointestinal dysfunction. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are known risk factors for both PD and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting a link between PD and the gastrointestinal tract. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing and spectral flow cytometry, we demonstrated that the Lrrk2 Gly2019Ser (G2019S) mutation is associated with an increased neutrophil presence in the colonic lamina propria during Citrobacter rodentium infection. This concurred with a Th17 skewing, upregulated Il17a, and greater colonic pathology during infection. In vitro experiments showed enhanced kinase-dependent neutrophil chemotaxis and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in Lrrk2 G2019S mice compared to wild-type counterparts. Our results add to the understanding of LRRK2-driven immune cell dysregulation and its contribution to PD, offering insights into potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention in PD.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major causes of severe lower respiratory tract infections, especially in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Complications arising from viral infections in these age groups can present therapeutic challenges, as most of these individuals have impaired adaptive immunity. Using the T‐ and B cell‐deficient Rag2−/− mice, the mechanisms that mediate protection in immunocompromised hosts during RSV infection can be investigated. RSV‐infected Rag2−/− mice showed no symptoms of disease or chronic inflammation in the lungs and airways despite the presence of infectious virus in their lungs several months after infection. Interestingly, Natural Killer (NK) cells, the main innate cells with anti‐viral cytotoxic effector functions, were recruited 2 days earlier in the lungs of Rag2−/− mice compared with wildtype mice, resulting in early production of IFN‐γ. However, depletion of NK cells did not affect disease severity or viral load. Together, these results suggest that the NK cells are largely dispensable for virus control during primary RSV infection in Rag2−/− mice.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The markedly reduced pathogenicity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant in comparison to earlier strains has raised critical questions regarding its underlying mechanisms. To elucidate the host immune responses driving these differences, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of lung and blood samples from human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice infected with either the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain or the Omicron BA.1 variant at 5 days post-inoculation. Both strains induced a reduction in lung cell numbers, with capillary endothelial cells showing the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Shared transcriptional responses included upregulation of chemokine (e.g. Gnaq, Lyn, Ccl5) and IL-17 signaling pathways. Notably, Omicron BA.1 infection resulted in downregulation of Txnip, a key gene involved in oxidative stress responses. Genes associated with neutrophil granules and pro-inflammatory functions (Mmp8, S100a8, S100a9) were also downregulated, whereas wound healing pathways were upregulated in immature neutrophils. Additionally, Omicron BA.1 altered gene expression associated with neutrophil migration from blood to lung, and decreased the activation of cell chemotaxis, cytokine-mediated signaling, IL-17 and NF-κB pathways in pro-inflammatory monocytes and pulmonary interstitial macrophages. These findings highlight distinct immunological signatures contributing to the attenuated pathogenicity of Omicron BA.1, particularly through the modulation of neutrophil and monocyte-macrophage responses.">

        <tr id="B cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). As a receptor of prostaglandin D2, chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells (CRTH2) is known to be involved in Th2 cell activation, but its function in B lymphocytes is unclear. Here, we show that CRTH2 is critical for an IL-1β-producing B cell subset. Mice with B-cell-specific deletion of Crth2 exhibit reduced numbers of IL-1β-producing B cells, resulting in amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal animal model of MS. Compared to wild-type B cells, adoptive transfer of Crth2-deficient B cells attenuates EAE disease severity in B-cell-deficient recipient mice. The IL-1β-producing B cell subpopulation was mainly transitional type 2 B cells identified by flow cytometry and single cell sequencing. Mechanically, CRTH2 promotes IL-1β production in B cells through p38 signaling, and pharmacological inhibition of p38 attenuates EAE disease severity in DK-PGD2-treated mice. Taken together, our results reveal a key function of CRTH2 in driving IL-1β expression in B cells and in controlling their pathogenic activity in autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Background Although COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory tract, liver injury has been increasingly reported in infected individuals. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces hepatocyte damage remain poorly understood. Given the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and regulated cell death in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatocytes using the Huh7.5 cell model. Methods Huh7.5 hepatocytes were infected with either the ancestral Wuhan (Wh) or Omicron (BA.5) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Viral replication was quantified via RT-qPCR, nucleocapsid protein detection, and infectious particle titration. Mitochondrial function was assessed through mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), mROS production, and mitophagy analysis. Lipid metabolism and regulated cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis) were evaluated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The role of specific cell death pathways was probed using chemical inhibitors. Results Both SARS-CoV-2 variants efficiently infected Huh7.5 cells, with distinct replication kinetics. Infection induced mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated mROS levels, and lipid droplet accumulation. Ferroptosis was identified as a predominant mode of cell death, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and the protective effect of ferrostatin-1. Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a ferroptosis marker and alternative viral entry receptor, was significantly upregulated post-infection in a variant-dependent manner. Additionally, mROS scavenging with MitoTEMPO impaired viral replication, underscoring the role of oxidative stress in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, promoting ferroptosis as a major contributor to virus-induced cytopathology. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may play a central role in COVID-19-related liver injury and identify mitochondrial ROS and iron metabolism as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="The recent COVID-19 pandemic left behind the lingering question as whether new variants of concern might cause further waves of infection. Thus, it is important to investigate the long-term protection gained via vaccination or exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here we compare the evolution of memory T-cell responses following primary infection with subsequent antigen exposures. Single-cell TCR analysis of three dominant SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T-cell responses identifies the dominant public TCRα clonotypes pairing with diverse TCRβ clonotypes that associated with mild disease at primary infection. These clonotypes are found at higher frequencies in pre-pandemic repertoires compared to other epitope-specific clonotypes. Longitudinal transcriptomics and TCR analysis, combined with functional evaluation, reveals that the clonotypes persisting 3–4 years post initial infection exhibit distinct functionality compared to those that were lost. Furthermore, spike-specific CD4+ T cells at this time point show decreased Th1 signatures and enhanced GZMA-driven cytotoxic transcriptomic profiles that were independent of TCR clonotype and associated with viral suppression. In summary, we identify common public TCRs used by immunodominant spike-specific memory CD4+ T-cells, associated with mild disease outcome, which likely play important protective roles to subsequent viral infection events.">

        <tr id="African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an important transboundary animal pathogen with significant impacts on the global swine industry. Overwhelming proinflammatory responses are a major virulence mechanism for ASFV, but the dynamics of these changes during clinical disease are not completely understood. We constructed a detailed portrait of the innate immune responses during acute African swine fever (ASF) at the cellular, transcriptomic, and cytokine levels. Samples serially obtained from infected piglets show progression of acute ASF is characterized by rapid increases in plasma type I interferons, TNF-α, IL-12p40, and IL-10, which coincide with the manifestation of clinical disease and viral DNAemia. Lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells progressively declined, with fluctuations in B cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell populations. Blood monocytes and macrophages were highly variable throughout infection, with an abrupt spike in CD203+ mature macrophages immediately prior to death. Transcriptomic analysis of blood showed downregulation of cellular translation as early as 1 day post challenge (DPC), and significant upregulation of antiviral immune processes at 5 DPC and 7 DPC which overlapped with the onset of clinical disease. Together, these results present a highly detailed delineation of fatal ASF as involving an initial infection and damage of susceptible myeloid cells prior to symptomatic disease characterized by pro-inflammatory immune responses, lymphoid depletion, and clinical deterioration.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV-infected and bystander-activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV-infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing. IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and functional genomics to understand the host response in both RSV-infected and bystander cells, identify what host factors mediate infection, and contextualize these findings relative to dozens of previously reported screens across 17 additional viruses.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately affected individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, such as neurocognitive disorders. Premorbid neurocognitive conditions compounded by COVID-19 can escalate into COVID-associated neurological complications, leading to severe illness or even death. As COVID-19 continues to persist and vaccines lose efficacy against emerging variants, individuals with neurocognitive disorders often experience prolonged symptoms that are further exacerbated by repeated breakthrough infections of highly diversified viral variants due to emergence of new viral mutations. Despite the significance of neurocognitive disorders as risk factors for COVID-19-related mortality and long COVID, the underlying causes remain largely unknown. In this study, we report a link between ORF3a expression and COVID-associated neuroinflammation and neurocytotoxicity in postmortem brain tissues from COVID-19 patients. These findings were further verified through neural cell-based in vitro and in vivo animal studies introducing ORF3a either alone or in the context of viral infection. As a membrane-associated protein, ORF3a induces upregulation of Sur1-regulated ion channels, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ influx, apoptosis, and necrosis through both NF-kB-dependent and independent proinflammatory responses in astrocytes. These findings reveal a novel clinical and mechanistic link between ORF3a and Sur1-regulated ion channels, which are highly responsive to neuroinflammatory conditions causing neurodegeneration. Additionally, we have identified a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, glibenclamide, and a natural antiviral compound glycyrrhizin that effectively mitigates the neuropathological effects of ORF3a, underscoring the therapeutic potential and clinical significance of these findings. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects individuals with pre-existing neurocognitive conditions primarily due to COVID-19-associated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity (CNN), which can progress to COVID-associated neurological disorders (CANDs), leading to severe illness and mortality. Despite CNN’s significant contribution to CANDs and related morbidity and mortality, its underlying causes remain poorly understood. Our study identifies ORF3a as a key driver of CNN, establishing a direct clinical and functional link between ORF3a and CNN linking to CANDs. Mechanistically, ORF3a disrupts ion homeostasis in astrocytes by promoting Ca²+ influx through Sur1-regulated ion channels, contributing to CNN. Notably, the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug glibenclamide, a Sur1-specific inhibitor, and the natural compound glycyrrhizin effectively mitigate ORF3a-induced neuropathology, highlighting ORF3a as a promising therapeutic target. These findings present a potential strategy to eliminate CNN and prevent CANDs.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic, significantly impacting social and economic aspects of society. While belonging to the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 exhibited unique characteristics that facilitated its widespread transmission and pathogenicity. This study aimed to investigate the molecular characterization and infection kinetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence. We isolated 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants from clinical samples and conducted in vitro studies using Calu-3 cell lines and pseudovirus systems to explore viral entry. Whole-genome sequencing identified mutations linked to increased replication and enhanced immune evasion, particularly through the inhibition of interferon responses. Additionally, persistence studies on common environmental surfaces (copper, aluminum, and plastic) revealed that certain variants, such as G446S, contributed to increased viral stability, suggesting potential for indirect transmission beyond direct person-to-person contact. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of “green” disinfectants, including tea tree oil and quercetin-based compounds, which demonstrated viral load reductions of over 95% within minutes, outperforming conventional alcohol- and UV-based disinfection methods. Notably, two influenza virus isolates belonging to highly divergent subtypes are sanitized as well while showing different persistence surface profiles compared to SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight the evolutionary strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 to ensure transmission, its ability to adapt under selective pressure, and the importance of ongoing surveillance of emerging variants. Moreover, the efficacy of environmentally sustainable disinfectants presents a promising strategy for reducing viral transmission in both clinical and community settings. IMPORTANCE In this study, we evaluated the molecular profile of 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence. Through whole-genome sequencing, we identified mutations linked to enhanced replication and immune evasion, notably through the suppression of interferon responses. Additionally, persistence studies on common environmental surfaces (copper, aluminum, and plastic) demonstrated that certain mutations, such as G446S, exhibited increased stability, suggesting a potential role for indirect transmission. This study underscores the need for continuous monitoring and the potential of eco-friendly disinfection approaches in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and possibly of other respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="Objectives Serological monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children and adolescents has been crucial for pandemic surveillance and response, while the role of T cell response monitoring remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the potential of T cell response monitoring in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We compared antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses in a subpopulation (n = 109) of children and adolescents from the Ciao Corona cohort study. Participants were followed up over 6 months, from November/December 2021 to June/July 2022, during the Delta and Omicron waves in Switzerland. Results Circulating, virus-specific T cell responses in children and adolescents were generally low and heterogeneous. T cell-mediated responses were not consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection status, with responses detectable in some seronegative individuals and not detectable in a considerable number of seropositive participants. Conclusion Circulating, virus-specific T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents from the general population offer limited additional insight. Monitoring humoral immunity is likely a more cost-effective approach and should be the primary focus of immunological surveillance in the general paediatric population.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the most significant public health events of the last century. As with other coronaviruses (SARS, MERS) the role of animals is of intense interest. Believed to have originated in bats, the role of other animals in the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still unclear, as is the range of susceptible hosts. American bison were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and monitored for seroconversion and the presence of viral RNA in oronasal secretions and feces. Although clinical signs were not seen, permissiveness of bison to infection with SARS-CoV-2 was manifest by seroconversion, the presence of viral RNA in oronasal secretions, persistence of viral RNA in lymphoid tissue, and viral associated interstitial pneumonia. Retrospective sequencing of the inoculum revealed a common in vitro adaptation in the furin cleavage site of the spike protein that may have reduced in vivo viral fitness. As such, we cannot exclude the possibility that use of an isolate with an intact furin cleavage motif would more efficiently infect bison.">

        <tr id="In human neurocysticercosis (NCC), the cellular and molecular mechanisms of host-parasite interactions triggering brain inflammation and epileptic seizures in Sub-Saharan Africa are poorly understood. Emerging evidence indicates that the viability of the cyst of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium determines brain inflammation and, thus, symptom development and disease severity. We have previously shown that while viable cyst-released molecules promote immune regulation and often asymptomatic disease, the fluid from degenerating cysts causes inflammation in microglia and peripheral immune cells, potentially driving immune-mediated pathology. This study aims to elucidate the apoptotic signaling pathways underlying this process and their relevance for symptomatic disease in NCC patients.Human and porcine peripheral immune cells, as well as murine microglia, were exposed to T. solium cyst vesicular fluid (CVF). Apoptosis signaling pathways were analysed using flow cytometric FLICA (fluorochrome-labeled inhibitors of caspases) caspase 8 and 9 assays, while mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed via TMRE and MitoTracker Deep Red and Green fluorescent probes. Apoptosis-inducing CVF molecules were identified by differential mass spectrometry and functionally tested using specific inhibitors. Caspase activity and soluble mediators (FasL, ROS, TNFα) were measured in NCC asymptomatic and symptomatic patients’ sera, and inflammatory T cell infiltrates expressing caspases near viable and degenerating cysts in naturally infected pig brain slices were examined via immunohistology.We found that vesicular fluid derived from cysts primarily induced apoptosis and caspase 3 and 9 activity, and only minimal necrosis, in a dose-dependent manner across central and peripheral immune cells. This effect was prominent in CD16+ monocytes, microglia, and in CD3+ T cell-expressing caspase 3 near degenerating brain cysts. Apoptotic signaling was predominantly mediated by a dynamic remodeling of caspase 9 pathway, accompanied by a significant loss of mitochondrial potential and a sharp decrease in Bid and Bcl2 transcription, favoring the intrinsic over the FasL-dependent extrinsic pathway and mechanisms. This process is primarily mediated by small molecules (< 30 kDa), and remained unaffected by heat and proteinase treatment. Notably, symptomatic NCC patients exhibited elevated FasL levels correlating with increased caspase activity, underscoring the potential contribution of apoptosis to disease pathogenesis.This study identifies caspase 9-mediated apoptosis as a mechanism of helminth-induced brain inflammation and implicates FasL in symptomatic disease progression. These insights enhance our understanding of NCC immunopathogenesis and may inform future therapeutic strategies targeting apoptotic pathways.">

        <tr id="Introduction Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by immune dysregulation, yet the mechanisms underlying T cell dysfunction remain poorly understood. Methods We integrated multi-omics data from public GEO datasets and prospective cohorts. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was applied to identify core genes, followed by diagnostic and prognostic validation. Cell–cell interaction networks were constructed to investigate signaling alterations, and cross-platform validation was conducted. Results Seven core genes (LTB, CD3D, TRAF3IP3, CD3G, GZMM, HLA-DPB1, CD3E) were identified, showing strong diagnostic value (AUC ≥ 0.86) and prognostic significance (HR=4.50 for CD3E). Network analysis revealed collapse of critical signaling axes (HLA-DRA-MHCII, ITGB2-CD226) and aberrant activation of inhibitory pathways (LGALS9-CD45), leading to a “co-stimulation inhibition–checkpoint activation” imbalance. Cross-platform validation confirmed conserved downregulation of these genes in sepsis, which contributed to immune exhaustion via disrupted T cell differentiation trajectories and impaired intercellular communication. Conclusion Our findings highlight novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for sepsis immunotherapy by systematically deciphering core gene networks and immune interaction collapse in T cell dysfunction.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic presents a spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from respiratory conditions to cardiovascular complications that challenge management and resource allocation. Identification of early predictive biomarkers that are easy to detect is a priority to optimize medical care and resources. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have received special attention due to their role in viral infectivity but also due to their physiological anti-inflammatory activities. CD15 and CD45 are key proteins in the immune response also associated with SARS-CoV-2 response. This study focused on analyzing the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD15, and CD45 in a cohort of 216 patients (111 mild and 105 severe disease) to ascertain their potential as biomarkers for predicting disease severity. We aimed to assess the correlation between these markers and the severity of symptoms, utilizing qPCR and flow cytometry. We used mixed-effects linear regression models and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to test the performance of the biomarkers in the prediction of the severity of the disease. Significant lower surface expression of CD15 and ACE2 was observed in severe cases in addition to a strong association between aging and the severity of the disease. By integrating these findings, we developed a predictive model achieving 92.9% specificity and 79.3% sensitivity (AUC = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.87–0.96). The study concludes that our combined biomarker model could significantly enhance the management of COVID-19 by enabling early identification of patients at risk for severe outcomes, thus improving treatment strategies and resource distribution.

        <tr id="There is an increasing need to understand the long-term dynamics and quality of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory—both humoral and cellular—particularly with emerging variants. This study aimed to evaluate immune durability and variant-specific modulation through a longitudinal analysis of individuals with diverse SARS-CoV-2 exposure histories, over two years after infection and/or vaccination. The study involved assessing anti-spike IgG and IgA levels over time and analyzing their relationship with neutralizing activity against both ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants. Persistence of T cell responses was evaluated using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and activation-induced marker (AIM) assays. Anti-S IgG levels remained stable over time and increased after each immune stimulation, suggesting cumulative immune memory. Neutralizing capacity correlated strongly with IgG levels, showing long-term stability for pre-Omicron variants, but a moderate decline for Omicron. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses persisted across all groups, largely unaffected by Omicron mutations. However, cytokine profiles revealed subtle, variant-dependent changes. These findings underscore the durability of cellular immunity and the comparatively reduced robustness of Omicron-specific humoral responses. Such insights are crucial for understanding long-term protection against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and guiding public health strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Coronaviruses encode nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15), a conserved endoribonuclease (EndoU) known to suppress host antiviral responses. It is imperative to understand the role of Nsp15/EndoU during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in its primary target respiratory epithelial cells. Using a recombinant wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (rWT) and a mutant with catalytically inactive EndoU (rH234A), we show that the EndoU activity is dispensable for viral replication in Vero cells but critically facilitates immune suppression and infection in physiologically relevant human lung cells, including human lung-derived epithelial cell lines, primary bronchial air-liquid interface cultures, and alveolar type 2 organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Compared to rWT, rH234A infection elicited augmented type I and III interferon (IFN) responses and stronger RNase L activation, suggesting that Nsp15 suppresses these antiviral pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although rH234A infection increased PKR phosphorylation, downstream eIF2α phosphorylation and stress granule formation remained limited, implying incomplete PKR/eIF2α pathway activation. Furthermore, Nsp15 mutants lacking key residues required for hexamerization or double-stranded RNA binding also showed impaired replication and heightened IFN responses, highlighting the importance of these structural features for EndoU function. In vivo, rH234A was attenuated in K18-hACE2 mice, resulting in improved survival, reduced viral loads, and milder lung pathology. Together, these findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15/EndoU as a key immune antagonist that facilitates lung infection, underscoring its potential as a target for antiviral development. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects upper and lower airway epithelial cells, and the latter infection can result in severe pneumonia. Understanding how the virus evades host immunity in these primary target cells is critical for developing effective therapies. Nsp15, a conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease (EndoU), is known to suppress antiviral responses, but its precise role in respiratory epithelial cells has remained unclear. This study reveals that while EndoU activity is dispensable for viral replication, it is essential for dampening host defenses in human lung-derived epithelial cell lines, primary bronchial air-liquid interface cultures, and alveolar type 2 organoids. Loss of EndoU activity results in enhanced interferon signaling and RNase L activation, along with partial PKR pathway engagement. Structural integrity, including double-stranded RNA binding and hexamerization, is vital for Nsp15 function. In vivo, an EndoU-deficient virus is attenuated in K18-hACE2 mice. These findings position Nsp15 as a key immune antagonist and a promising target for antiviral intervention.">

        <tr id="A Cytokine storm is critical in severe dengue, significantly contributing to disrupted endothelial integrity, plasma leakage, and haemorrhage manifestations in affected patients. Various reports have demonstrated that mononuclear phagocytes, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, are target cells of DENV infection. They contribute to viral spread into tissues and promote robust inflammatory responses and immunopathology. However, it remains unclear whether the early events of DENV infection play a role in triggering cytokine storms in infected mononuclear phagocytes. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profile of in vitro DENV-2-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) based on the kinetics of viral replication through a standard growth curve. To verify the accuracy of our approach, we used RT-qPCR, ELISA, and transcriptomic data from in vitro DENV-2-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and monocytes obtained from acute dengue patients. RNA-Seq analysis revealed dynamic changes in the transcriptional profile of DENV-2-infected MDMs throughout the viral growth curve. Two waves of differentially expressed genes were observed: the first occurred during the eclipse period of viral replication (3 to 5.5 h.p.i) and was associated with the induction of NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory factors, while the second wave at 24 h.p.i coincided with peaks of DENV-2 replication and induction of both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, DENV-2 infection promoted the dynamic activation of Toll-like receptors, RIG-like receptors, inflammasomes, and inflammatory pathways, triggering innate pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses. A robust multi-type IFN-dependent antiviral response was also observed at the late stage of infection. A similar transcriptomic profile was found in DENV-2-infected MDDCs and monocyte subsets from acute dengue patients, further confirming the reliability of our in vitro model of DENV-infected MDMs. Together, results suggest that recognizing viral PAMPs during the eclipse period of DENV-2 infection promotes a robust NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in MDMs. In addition, at later stages of infection, recognizing structural DENV-PAMPs and/or viral replication intermediates induces both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses, leading to a cytokine storm. These findings highlight the critical role of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in detecting DENV infection and triggering a cytokine storm in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that these cell populations could be potential targets for future immunotherapies to modulate the inflammatory response to DENV infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunity response following vaccination and infection toward the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant remains limited in chronic liver disease (CLD) population. This study aims to investigate humoral and cell-mediate immunity to Omicron BA.4/5 among CLD patients with/without breakthrough infections (BI). This longitudinal study characterized immune responses to Omicron infection across three CLD patient groups: vaccinated without BI (group 1, n = 10), vaccinated with BI (group 2, n = 43), and unvaccinated infected (group 3, n = 7). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies/T-cell responses and lymphocyte phenotypes were quantified by ELISA and flow cytometry. Logistic regression identified immunological correlates of BI event, viral clearance and liver disease progression. Dynamic immunity changes after infection analyzed using Spearman’s correlation. Patients in group 2 exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.4.5, anti-RBD IgG, and total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to groups 1 and 3. Comparable T cell responses were observed between two vaccinated groups, stronger than unvaccinated individuals. Hybrid immune (vaccination plus infection) elicited stronger NAbs-WT, total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, anti-RBD IgG, MBCs, and Omicron-specific IFN-γ+/IL-4+CD4+T cells compared to primary Omicron infection. Besides, severe liver disease was not only a risk factor for BI, but also impaired Omicron-specific IFN-γ+CD8+T, CD38+CD4+T, and CD45RA+CD8+T cells responses after infection. Importantly, IgG+/IgM+MBCs and NAbs showed positive associations with central memory (CD45RA−CD62L+CD4/8) or naive (CD45RA+CD62L+CD4) T cells. Low levels of CD45RA+CD62L+CD8+T cells and resting MBCs were identified as the independent risk factors for viral clearance and disease progression, respectively. BI predominantly stimulates humoral immunity without enhancing cellular responses. Weaker immune response induced by primary Omicron infection underscores the need for additional vaccinations in vaccine-naïve CLD patients. The positive correlations between humoral/cellular immunity and memory/activated T cells reveal their coordinated role in adaptive immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. These findings emphasize the importance of regular immune monitoring and timely interventions to optimize protection for CLD patients against emerging Omicron subvariants.">

        <tr id="Introduction An unbalanced immune response and excessive inflammation are the major hallmarks of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in multiorgan failure and death. The dysregulation of the complement system has been shown in various studies as a crucial factor in the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Complement alternative pathway has been linked to the excessive inflammation in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in which decreased levels of factor H (FH) and elevated levels of properdin (FP) were observed. The current study investigated the potential immune protective roles of FP and FH against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods The interactions between FH and FP and the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and its receptor binding domain (RBD) were evaluated using direct ELISA. The cell binding and luciferase-based viral entry assays utilising S protein expressing lentiviral pseudotypes were used to evaluate the possible modulatory effects of FH, FP, and recombinant thrombospondin repeats 4 and 5 (TSR4 + 5) on SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Using RT-qPCR, we also assessed the immunomodulatory roles of FH and FP in the cytokine response induced by SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes. Results FH and FP were found to bind to both the RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. The treatment of FP or TSR4 + 5 enhanced cell binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes that was administered in A549 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells). FP increases the affinity between host ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2, according to in silico work. In A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells, the effect of FP on viral cell entry and binding was counteracted by anti-FP antibody treatment. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudotypes’ cell entry and binding were decreased by FH treatment. The A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 alphaviral pseudotypes (expressing spike, envelope, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins) pre-treated with FP or TSR4+5 showed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts, including NF-κB and IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-α, and RANTES. Contrary to this, the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines was downregulated by FH treatment. FH treatment decreased S protein-mediated NF-κB activation, but FP treatment enhanced it in A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells. Discussion These results imply that FH may function as a SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and binding inhibitor, reducing the inflammatory response linked to infection independently of complement activation. FP could aid cell viral entry and binding and aggravate hyperinflammation that might contribute to the severity of the infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Airborne transmissibility of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in humans is considered an essential component of their pandemic risk. Although several viral factors regulating airborne transmission (AT) have been delineated, it is not known what, if any, responses at the respiratory epithelia are determinants of AIV AT. Using responses in the ferret nasal epithelium to a panel of H1N1 AIVs, we describe host responses that segregate with AT phenotypes. AIV infection upregulated interferon alpha and gamma responses and IL-6 JAK-STAT signaling and downregulated oxidative phosphorylation. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that cellular genotoxic stress and NF-kB, interferon, and cell fate pathways differentiated host responses to AIVs with different transmissibilities. These responses culminated in greater AIV antigen-containing exudate and debris in the respiratory spaces of the nasal epithelium of ferrets inoculated with AT AIVs. More abundant CMPK2, SP100, and CXCL10 transcription in infected epithelia was a hallmark of AT viruses. Overall, our study reveals host responses associated with AIV infection and transmission in the nasal epithelium, the determinant anatomical site of influenza virus transmission. IMPORTANCE Airborne transmission (AT) is a critical component of the pandemic risks posed by avian influenza A viruses (AIVs). However, the host responses ultimately dictating transmissibility elicited by AIVs in the upper respiratory tract of mammals, the determinant site of influenza virus AT, are largely unknown. We identified host responses in the nasal epithelium of the upper respiratory tract differentially expressed in response to infection by AIVs of different mammalian ATs. Our data indicate that a definable host response was associated with AT of AIVs. These data would serve as an important basis for future mechanistic studies of AIV zoonosis and potentially have implications for understanding the mechanisms of transmission of respiratory viruses between humans.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with cytotoxic activity against tumors and viruses. The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased the investigation of their role in disease severity. However, their functional status and modulators remain controversial. Recent studies highlighted the role of metabolism in immune function, but metabolic changes in NK cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unexplored. This study compares metabolic (SIRT1, AMPKA, HIF1A, and GLUT1) and inflammatory (NFKB1, NFKB1A, IFNG, and SOCS1) gene expression, and flow cytometry-based assessment of functional markers in NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients (n=15) and the control group (n=10), and their association with clinical outcomes. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated IFNγ, Granzyme B, and KIR2DL1 expression in NK cells compared to controls (P < 0.005), while LAMP1 was unchanged (P > 0.05). NK cells from deceased patients exhibited significantly lower expression levels of LAMP1 and Granzyme B (P < 0.05). Patients hospitalized >7 days presented lower Granzyme-B+ NK cells (P < 0.05). NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients showed downregulation of HIF1A and GLUT1, and upregulation of NFKB1 (P < 0.05). HIF1A and GLUT1 expression were elevated in patients with >7 days of hospitalization (P < 0.05). SIRT1 expression was higher in patients requiring intubation (P < 0.05). SIRT1, HIF1A, and GLUT1 were upregulated in deceased patients (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrate that NK cells from patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit increased functional markers and dysregulated metabolic gene expression associated with clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Circulating platelets are increasingly recognized for their critical involvement in thromboinflammatory complications during respiratory infections, underscoring the importance of comprehending their dual role in immunomodulation and hemostasis. The multifaceted roles of platelets are attributed to their inherent heterogeneity, where the molecular diversity enables their functional versatility. However, research remains deficient in dissecting platelet heterogeneity within respiratory infection contexts, capturing the platelet subpopulations exhibiting specialized functional roles, and elucidating the therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab. Methods Leveraging the adequate platelet population detected through single-cell RNA sequencing, this study established stratified study cohorts central to: (1) COVID-19 disease severity, (2) therapeutic responsiveness, and (3) non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. An integrative annotation framework was implemented in this study, which encompassed co-expressed gene module identification, cell-cell communication network mapping, and cell trajectory assessment, to hierarchically dissect the functional dynamics of platelet heterogeneity in disease pathologies and their modulation by therapeutic interventions. Results This study unfolds six severity-associated platelet subpopulations, explores their modulation by corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments, and extends the findings to non-COVID-19 severe conditions. In severe COVID-19, platelet subpopulations with elevated innate immune responsiveness and high coagulation potential are intensively enriched, whereas following dexamethasone administration, this pro-coagulable subpopulation is remarkably repressed. Post-tocilizumab treatment, the instructive interaction from platelets to IFN-activated CD8+ T cells is reduced, while communications from memory B cells, CD4+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to platelets are enhanced. A platelet trajectory, which participates in neutrophil chemotaxis and B cell-mediated humoral responses, emerges specifically in COVID-19 conditions and is absent in non-COVID-19. Conclusions A systematic investigation of platelet transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory infections, combined with the delineation of its therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab, advances the understanding of platelet involvement in immune-thrombotic dysregulation and provides a foundation for exploring potential therapeutic targets.

However, HAND remains a concern, particularly among aging individuals with HIV-1. The mechanisms underlying HAND are not well understood. Methods This study investigated the role of interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) and its upstream regulator, signal transducer, and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), in HAND pathology. Using the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and HIV-infected humanized mice, we examined the effects of the cART drugs, HIV Tat protein, and HIV-1 virus on STAT1 and IFIT3 expression. Results The results showed that HIV-1 exposure significantly upregulated STAT1 and IFIT3, contributing to neuroinflammation.

        <tr id="Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant became the dominant driver during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high transmissibility and immune escape potential. Although clinical outcomes are generally mild to moderate, the inflammatory mechanisms triggered by Omicron subvariants remain poorly defined. The goal of this study was to consider both viral evolution and the host immune response by assessing plasma cytokine levels in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Methods: A total of 115 individuals were recruited, including 40 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR. Demographic, clinical, and comorbidity data were collected. Plasma levels of IL-6, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17A were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array. Subvariant data were obtained from GISAID records and grouped into early (BA.1-lineage) and late (BA.4/BA.5-lineage) Omicron clusters. Statistical analysis included non-parametric and parametric tests, correlation matrices, and multivariate comparisons. Results: Pharyngitis, nasal discharge, cough, and headache were the most common symptoms among infected individuals. Despite no significant variation in symptom distribution across subvariants, infected patients showed higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-2 compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected controls (p < 0.05). IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in early Omicron infections. No associations were observed between cytokine levels and comorbidities. A significant correlation was found between reporting fewer symptoms and having received three vaccine doses. Conclusions: Infection with Omicron subvariants elicits a strong yet balanced cytokine response. Despite genetic divergence between lineages, immune and clinical patterns remain conserved, with vaccination appearing to mitigate the symptom burden.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes, along with cytokines and chemokines-dependent pathways are primarily responsible for regulating the immune response, controlling inflammation and eliminating viral infections. However, excessive immune activity can lead to pathological effects such as cytokine storm, which may cause severe respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ damage in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection that could predict the severity of COVID-19 progression.The cohort in this study included 52 hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from Warsaw, Poland admitted to the hospital during COVID-19 pandemic (February to November 2021). Based on clinical symptoms, patients were divided into two groups: (i) mild/moderate symptoms (non-severe) – 44 patients and (ii) severe respiratory failure (severe) – 8 patients. The control group consisted of 26 individuals without COVID-19. All COVID-19 patients and healthy controls underwent immunophenotyping of peripheral blood to assess the abundance of T lymphocytes and regulatory T lymphocytes, as well as measurement of selected cytokine and chemokine concentrations in corresponding serum samples. Data analysis was performed using CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer. Decreased percentages of total lymphocytes and T lymphocytes in peripheral blood were observed across all COVID-19 patients, with varying degrees between the non-severe and severe groups. A significant reduction was also noted in double-positive lymphocytes (CD4+CD8+), regulatory T lymphocytes ( CD4+ CD25HiCD127Lo and CD4+CD25HiCD127LoFoxP3+), as well as CD4+CD25+/-, CD4+CD45RA+/-, and CD8+CD45RA+/- subsets. Elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-g, CCL2, CXCL8, and CXCL10 were observed in the non-severe and/or severe groups compared to healthy controls. Most importantly, only CXCL10 was significantly elevated in the severe group at admission compared to the non-severe group. In this study, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 as a crucial marker for distinguishing the severe course of COVID-19 from non-severe form at the time of admission. It may serve as an early indicator of diseases progression during hospitalization, potentially allowing prediction of the disease course. Moreover, elevated CXCL10 levels, in combination with decreased total lymphocytes counts and increased levels of IL-6, IL10, IFNg, CCL2 and CXCL9, may represent a more comprehensive biomarker panel suitable for predicting the severity of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a health risk for humans and other domestic and wildlife species. Recently, North American elk have been identified as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a potential threat to humans and other mammals. In this work, we characterized the peripheral transcriptomic response to experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in calves and adult elk at different time points. Results Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified at 2-, 5-, and 14-days post inoculation (pi) for both age groups. Adult elk presented the greatest number of differentially expressed (DE) genes at all time points, including many genes associated with viral response, immune activation, antibody production, as well as genes associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and coronavirus GO terms and KEGG pathways. Calves presented DE genes associated with viral responses at 5 days pi as well as neurodegenerative-associated genes at 14 days pi. Both adults and calves showed predicted activation of the ISGF3 and IFN type I pathways at day 2 pi and, globally, increased activity related to the coronavirus pathway disease at 5 and 14 days pi. Conclusions Collectively, this work provides valuable data characterizing the cervid immune response of elk to viral diseases as well as the response of wildlife to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The mechanisms underlying why only a subset of children develop this hyperinflammatory response remain unclear. Methods We performed an in-depth proteomic analysis of plasma samples from children before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those who developed MIS-C. Proteomic profiling was conducted using high-throughput technologies, and findings were validated using publicly available datasets. Results Healthy children showed minimal changes in the circulating proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of ongoing inflammation. In contrast, children with MIS-C exhibited significant activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and elevated circulating markers of myocardial and vascular injury. Conclusions Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection alone does not cause sustained proteomic alterations in most children. However, MIS-C is associated with a distinct inflammatory and vascular injury signature. Several candidate diagnostic biomarkers for MIS-C were identified and validated in silico, offering promising avenues for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="As an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits remarkable contagiousness and has emerged as a critical global public health concern. In critically ill patients, virus-induced cytokine storms and resulting multi-organ failure represent significant therapeutic challenges. In our clinical observations, we identified that this hyperinflammatory state was correlated with reduced mRNA expression of both Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-Induced Protein 8-like Protein 2 (TIPE2)—an immune negative modulator—and the ferroptosis marker gene Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of these patients. Given the emerging evidence that macrophage polarization and dysfunction play pivotal roles in COVID-19 progression, we established a THP-1-derived macrophage model stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to mimic the host immune response. Our results demonstrated that TIPE2 modulates S protein-induced macrophage polarization and ferroptosis, specifically by suppressing M1 polarization associated with inflammation and encouraging M2 polarization linked to anti-inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that TIPE2 mediates critical immunomodulatory effects during the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating pathological inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients gravely affected.

Cerebrovascular Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity is suppressed in association with neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in a mouse model of COVID-19. In this study, we asked whether SARS-CoV-2 (NY Iota strain) infection of astrocytes would result in cell-autonomous changes in Wnt/β-catenin pathway components. We report that induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived human astrocytes (iAs) are susceptible to sustained infection with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Real-time PCR revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of iAs decreased transcripts for Wnt3a, Wnt10b, and the downstream pathway effectors β-catenin and TCF3. Wnt7b was increased, as was the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10. No changes were noted in Wnt3, Wnt7a, TCF1, TCF4, or LEF1.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2029 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which enters the human body via the respiratory route and can infect nasal and bronchial epithelial cells, goblet cells, hair cells, pneumocytes, etc. COVID-19 caused the worst pandemic in centuries. SARS-CoV-2, once in the airway tree, penetrates the host cells and causes a strong inflammatory reaction by a rapid response of the innate immune system, in particular by activation of macrophages and dendritic cells that recognize the virus component proteins as non-self. Cells of the immune system secrete type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines, initiating an antiviral state in neighboring cells and in the intercellular connective matrix, recruiting new immune mediators and new cells to the site of infection. This rapid response is crucial for limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we aimed at highlighting some microscopic aspects of the acute inflammatory reaction in the lung for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis of the histological pieces suggested that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction begins with the accumulation of immune cells in the interalveolar septa in response to viral insult, congestion of pulmonary vessels with increased blood volume in pulmonary vessels, followed by the presence of alveolar exudate, which reduces the area of hematosis and triggers respiratory symptoms. The inflammatory reaction was totally inhomogeneous, varying widely from patient to patient and even within the same patient, probably depending on the immune status, age or comorbidities. It presented two phases, a predominantly exudative phase (EP) and a predominantly proliferative phase (PP), intricately intertwined; sometimes, on the same histopathological piece, we identified both areas of incipient inflammatory reaction (EP) and a very intense reaction in the PP, suggesting that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction developed rapidly. The inflammatory infiltrate had a complex composition: neutrophilic leukocytes, macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The most abundant inflammatory cells were macrophages, both in the EP and PP. The use of anti-interleukin (IL) antibodies showed that ILs are mainly produced by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system, but also by conjunctival cells (fibroblasts).">

        <tr id="Vaccines played a crucial role in the COVID-19 pandemic, but their long-term biological effects and efficacy in vulnerable populations remain under intensive investigation. This study assessed clinical outcomes, comorbidities, and systemic biomarker and proteomic profiles in 366 multimorbid patients, stratified into four groups based on SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination status (COV+ vac+, COV+ vac−, COV− vac+, COV− vac−). Clinical and laboratory data, including comorbidities and relevant biomarkers, were collected. Proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry was performed to identify molecular changes associated with infection and vaccination. Statistical analyses examined associations between clinical status, biomarkers, and patient outcomes. As most participants received mRNA-based vaccines, the results primarily reflect responses to spike protein-expressing platforms. Biomarkers of cardiac and renal stress—namely proBNP and carbamide—were elevated in vaccinated individuals. Five deaths occurred in the COV+ vac+ group and two in the COV+ vac− group, most of which were attributed to exacerbations of pre-existing chronic diseases rather than to COVID-19 pneumonia. Protection against breakthrough infections waned over time, particularly beyond 200 days post-vaccination. Mass spectrometry identified proteins such as actin, fibrinogen chains, and SAA2 as potential diagnostic targets. Although the cross-sectional observational design limits the ability to draw causal inferences, the observed waning immunity and potential systemic alterations in vaccinated multimorbid patients highlight the importance of longitudinal follow-up to guide tailored immunization strategies and post-vaccination monitoring in high-risk groups.">

        <tr id="Neonatal pneumonia, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is frequently caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS). The mechanisms underlying protective immunity to this pathogen in the neonatal lung remain incompletely understood. Using a clinically relevant neonatal mouse model of GBS pneumonia, we investigated the immune mechanisms influencing disease severity. We demonstrate that neutrophils are effectively recruited to the lungs of infected neonates, but their phenotype differs with disease severity. In pups with moderate disease, we observe significant infiltration of SiglecFhi neutrophils, a phenotype associated with enhanced phagocytic capacity and bacterial clearance. In contrast, pups with severe disease failed to develop SiglecFhi neutrophils, resulting in reduced bacterial clearance and worsened pathology. We further show that severity is associated with increased expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the lungs. CGRP suppressed neutrophil activation into the SiglecFhi phenotype, thereby limiting their antibacterial function. Our findings show that GBS exploits the neuroimmune axis to evade host immunity through CGRP-mediated suppression of neutrophil activation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are crucial innate immune cells that play important roles during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Ex vivo human precision‐cut lung slices (PCLSs) are well‐suited models to study immune reactions and biochemical changes within host cells as well as to follow functional macrophage phenotype plasticity within complex tissue environment. Raman spectroscopy emerged in recent years as a powerful method for label‐free cell characterization. Methods Human PCLSs from one donor were infected with either the SARS‐CoV‐2 delta or omicron variant. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized AMs and virus particles. Cytokine levels of interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) and interleukin 18 (IL‐18) were quantified. The lung slice model was optimized for label‐free Raman spectroscopic imaging and for the characterization of single AMs within the three‐dimensional structure of the PCLS model. Results Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the location of AMs and virus particles within the PCLS model. Raman spectroscopic imaging generated false‐colour images, revealing distinct spectroscopic differences between AMs in the uninfected control PCLS model and those in PCLS models infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. These differences included variations in intracellular RNA, carotenoid, triacyl glyceride, and glucose levels, consistent in interpretation with cytokine quantification data. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification model achieved an 83% accuracy in distinguishing cells from infected lung slices from those of the uninfected controls. The LDA loadings pointed to spectral bands that had been previously identified in an in vitro stimulation study of macrophages. Conclusions Raman spectroscopy can characterize the cellular immune response and phenotype plasticity of AMs to infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 within a PCLS model in a label‐free and non‐invasive manner. The ability to distinguish cells from infected PCLSs from cells of the uninfected control PCLS based on intracellular biochemical changes highlights the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a powerful diagnostic tool in immunology and clinical diagnostics.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection disrupts the host’s immune system, altering autoimmune responses. This study investigated host autoreactivities in SARS-CoV-2 infections, their association with severe COVID-19, and the neutralizing antibody response. Circulating autoantibodies were detected in convalescent serum samples from unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Clustering, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and neural network modeling were used to explore the relationship between autoantibodies, hospitalization, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The presence of one autoantibody correlated with the detection of multiple others. Anti-IFNα antibodies were associated with elevated levels of anti-ENAs (extractable-nuclear antigen) but not with clinical outcome. COVID-19 hospitalization was significantly associated with the collective expression of autoantibodies targeting three ENAs: SSA/Ro52, Jo-1, and RNP. In contrast, autoantibodies targeting RNP/Sm, PCNA, Scl-70, and PL-12 were strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. In summary, this study has identified self-antigens targeted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and highlights a novel association between the autoantibody response and the antiviral humoral response.">

This study presents the first de novo assembled transcriptome of Culex annulirostris, a major Australian JEV vector, and examines its transcriptional response to infection with JEV. A total of 350, 322, and 451 genes were differentially expressed at 2, 7, and 12 days post-infection, respectively, involving functions related to membrane-bounded organelles, protein metabolic processes, and catalytic activity. To identify potential viral entry factors, JEV Envelope protein was incubated with lysates from Culex quinquefasciatus Hsu cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry revealed prohibitin, annexin, and 14-3-3ε as interacting proteins. Silencing these genes reduced JEV infection, and anti-prohibitin antibodies further suppressed viral replication. These findings highlight mosquito transcriptomic responses to JEV and identify annexin, 14-3-3ε, and prohibitin—especially prohibitin—as pro-viral factors and potential targets for blocking JEV entry.">

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has prompted extensive research into factors influencing the onset and severity of the disease. Among these factors, the role of the nasopharyngeal microbiome, a vital ecosystem critical for respiratory health and immune modulation, remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between the composition of nasopharyngeal microbiota and the clinical presentation of COVID-19 during the initial phase of infection. Materials and methods A total of 81 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from individuals in Central Greece between January and February 2021. Following quality control, 77 samples were selected for microbiome analysis. This selection included SARS-CoV-2-negative controls (NE, n = 26) and SARS-CoV-2-positive patients classified as asymptomatic (AS, n = 19), mild (MI, n = 16), or severe (SE, n = 16) based on clinical criteria. All COVID-19-positive samples were collected within 2 days of symptom onset, and participants with recent hospitalization or antibiotic use were excluded. Microbiome profiling was performed using 16S rRNA gene-targeted metagenomic sequencing, followed by comprehensive bioinformatics and statistical analyses. Results Significant differences were observed in both alpha and beta diversity measures, with alpha diversity decreasing as the severity of COVID-19 increased. Three of the four individual study groups, namely NE, MI, and SE, exhibited distinct microbial profiles, while the asymptomatic group showed greater heterogeneity. Significant variations in the abundance of specific phyla, families, and genera were identified between the different study groups. When comparing the NE and SE groups, we observed a significant increase in the abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum in the SE group, while the abundance of Fusobacteria was significantly lower in the SE group. In symptomatic COVID-19 patients, we observed a significant reduction in the abundance of key family constituents of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, such as Fusobacteriaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Streptococcaceae, suggesting a disruption in microbial homeostasis during the infection. Conversely, we found an increased prevalence of families associated with pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, in the SE group, suggesting a potential role of these taxa in the disease progression of COVID-19. Conclusion These findings shed light on specific genera that undergo significant changes during COVID-19 infection and contribute to our understanding of the dynamic nature of the nasopharyngeal microbiome in relation to disease progression and severity.">

With no approved treatments, the long-term global health and economic impact of chronic LC remains high and growing. LC affects children, adolescents, and healthy adults and is characterized by over 200 diverse symptoms that persist for months to years after the acute COVID-19 infection is resolved. These symptoms target twelve major organ systems, causing dyspnea, vascular damage, cognitive impairments (“brain fog”), physical and mental fatigue, anxiety, and depression. This heterogeneity of LC symptoms, along with the lack of specific biomarkers and diagnostic tests, presents a significant challenge to the development of LC treatments. While several biological abnormalities have emerged as potential drivers of LC, a causative factor in a large subset of patients with LC, involves reservoirs of virus and/or viral RNA (vRNA) that persist months to years in multiple organs driving chronic inflammation, respiratory, muscular, cognitive, and cardiovascular damages, and provide continuous viral antigenic stimuli that overstimulate and exhaust CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In this review, we (i) shed light on persisting virus and vRNA reservoirs detected, either directly (from biopsy, blood, stool, and autopsy samples) or indirectly through virus-specific B and T cell responses, in patients with LC and their association with the chronic symptomatology of LC; (ii) explore potential mechanisms of inflammation, immune evasion, and immune overstimulation in LC; (iii) review animal models of virus reservoirs in LC; (iv) discuss potential T cell immunotherapeutic strategies to reduce or eliminate persistent virus reservoirs, which would mitigate chronic inflammation and alleviate symptom severity in patients with LC.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous betaherpesvirus that establishes lifelong latent infection in CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. A unique subset of viral genes is expressed during latency, which functions to modulate cellular mechanisms without supporting viral replication. One potential function of these genes is to regulate the differentiation state of latently infected CD34+ cells, thereby preventing their progression into antigen-presenting cells, e.g., dendritic cells. In this study, we first compared CD34+ cells that supported productive and latent infections using the RV-TB40-BACKL7-SE-EGFP virus. Over a seven-day time course, the proportion of latently infected CD34+ cell subsets within the myeloid progenitor population remained similar to that in the mock-infected control. However, starting from day 3 post-infection, there was an increase in the proportion of the early progenitor subsets, including haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs). In contrast, productively infected cells, which constituted less than 1% of the population, only accounted for a small portion of the myeloid progenitors. Importantly, our data revealed that the innate immune STING/p-TBK1/p-IRF3 pathway was activated in latently infected CD34+ cells, yet type I interferon (IFN) expression was decreased. This decrease was attributed to impaired p-IRF3 nuclear translocation, limiting the induction of an autocrine type I IFN response. However, treatment with IFN-β could induce myelopoiesis in latently infected cells. In summary, HCMV modulates a key component of the STING pathway to inhibit antiviral immune responses by decreasing the type I IFN-mediated cell differentiation of CD34+ progenitor cells. This study uncovered a new mechanism of latent HCMV-mediated regulation of the host cell differentiation response.">

Results: Here, we analyzed public gene expression data of blood leukocytes, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and lung tissues from uninfected healthy humans and those infected with the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We found that PDLIM2 expression was repressed by viral infection, and notably, this repression correlated with the severity of infectious diseases. Consistently, the expression level of PDLIM2 was negatively associated with NF-κB and STAT3 activity across a diverse range of cell types, such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, alveolar type 1 and 2 epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. Accordingly, cells with low PDLIM2 expression exhibited aberrant activation of signaling pathways essential for cellular functions and immune responses. Conclusions: These findings highlight PDLIM2 repression as a common mechanism underlying human viral infectious diseases and suggest PDLIM2 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for disease prognosis, prevention, and treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is characterized by profound immune and metabolic perturbations, with glycolysis serving as a pivotal modulator of immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms linking glycolytic reprogramming to immune dysfunction remain poorly defined. Methods Transcriptomic profiles of sepsis were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to glycolysis were identified through a combination of ssGSEA, WGCNA and differential expression analysis. Hub genes were prioritized using Mendelian randomization and machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVM-RFE, and Boruta), and validated in an independent dataset and by RT-qPCR in a clinical sepsis cohort. Immune cell infiltration was assessed using CIBERSORT to profile the immune landscape, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to delineate the cell type-specific transcriptional profiles. Results The ssGSEA scores derived from the glycolysis signature indicated a marked reduction in glycolytic activity associated with sepsis. By employing an integrative framework that includes WGCNA, differential expression analysis, Mendelian randomization, and machine learning algorithms, this study successfully identified five pivotal genes associated with glycolysis: DDX18, EIF3L, MAK16, THUMPD1, and ZNF260. The diminished expression of these genes was significantly correlated with immune remodeling, characterized by an increase in neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes. In a clinical sepsis cohort, RT–qPCR of peripheral blood, in conjunction with routine hematological profiling, validated their expression pattern and immune associations. Moreover, scRNA-seq facilitated a comprehensive characterization of these transcriptional alterations within distinct subsets of immune cells. Conclusion This study identifies five glycolysis-related genes linked to immune remodeling in sepsis, revealing a metabolic–immune axis that may drives disease pathogenesis and offers promising targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="CD9 protein belongs to a family of proteins called tetraspanins, so named for their four-transmembrane-spanning architectures. These proteins are located in domains in the plasmatic membrane, called tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs). Several proteases and cellular receptors for virus entry cluster into TEMs, suggesting that TEMs are preferred virus entry portals. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates virus attachment and entry into cells by binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). In addition, the secretory, type-I membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 S protein is synthesized as a precursor (proS) that undergoes posttranslational cleavages by host cell proteases, such as furin and TMPRSS2. Moreover, it has been shown that neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which is known to bind furin-cleaved substrates, potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our results indicate that CD9 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we show how knocking out CD9 leads to a decrease in the expression of NRP1, a protein that improves SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we show that CD9 colocalizes with ACE-2, NRP1, furin, and TMPRSS2 at the plasma membrane; that the absence of CD9 decreases the expression of these proteins on the plasma membrane CD9-enriched microdomains, and that CD9 interacts with ACE2. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD9 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection and that CD9 brings together different host proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry into host cells, such as ACE2, NRP1, furin, and TMPRSS2. Importantly, the fact that a blocking antibody targeting CD9 can effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 titers highlights not only the mechanistic role of CD9 in viral entry but also offers translational potential, suggesting that tetraspanin-targeting antibodies could be developed as therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other coronaviruses, with meaningful implications for clinical intervention.">

Comparing B cell responses in the upper respiratory tract following vaccination and infection may offer unique insights into mucosal immunity. Here, we characterized antigen-specific B cells in the tonsils, adenoids, and peripheral blood of children who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. SARS-CoV-2-specific switched memory B cells (BSM) and germinal center B cells were found in the blood and pharyngeal lymphoid tissues after vaccination or infection. However, infection generated a higher proportion of IgA+ BSM and CXCR3+CD21+ BSM, which showed distinct spatial localization, greater clonal expansion and increased propensity for plasma cell differentiation compared to their CXCR3− counterparts, accompanied by persistent activation of innate and T follicular helper cells in the tissues. Our data provide evidence for tissue-specific B cell memory after either SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection, but with distinct characteristics that can influence the quality, durability, and localization of immunity.">

        <tr id="Functional T cell responses are crucial for protective immunity induced by COVID-19 vaccination, but factors influencing the quality of these responses are incompletely understood. We used an activation-induced marker (AIM) assay and single-cell transcriptomic sequencing to analyze SARS-CoV-2 spike-responsive T cells after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection or after one or two doses of mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) or adenoviral-vectored COVID-19 vaccines. Our findings revealed broad functional and clonal heterogeneity in T cells generated by vaccination or infection, including multiple distinct effector populations. T cell function was largely conserved between COVID-19 vaccine platforms but was distinct compared with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the dosing interval greatly influenced the quality of T cells after two vaccine doses, particularly after mRNA-LNP vaccination, where a longer interval led to reduced inflammatory signaling and increased secondary proliferation. These insights enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and inform the optimization of mRNA vaccination regimens.">

        <tr id="Understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cancer patients remains a critical priority given their immunocompromised status. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated humoral and cellular immunity across three time points—baseline, post-second dose, and post-booster—in 23 breast cancer patients undergoing active treatment. IgG antibody levels showed a significant increase following vaccination, with a 300-fold rise after the second dose and a 2200-fold increase post-booster, indicating a strong humoral response. CD19+ B cells also increased significantly, supporting B cell-mediated activation. Although overall T cell frequencies remained stable, we observed a shift toward memory phenotypes, with decreased naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased central and peripheral memory subsets after the booster. Notably, CD8+ TEMRA cells expanded significantly, suggesting cytotoxic memory formation. Correlation analyses linked peripheral memory CD4+ T cells with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, while CD8+ TEMRA cells showed an inverse association. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response was evaluated using APC-labeled MHC I Dextramer reagents. After the booster, 55.5% of patients developed detectable antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, whereas 44.5% did not. Importantly, one patient who failed to develop antigen-specific CD8+ T cells experienced a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the absence of this response may increase susceptibility despite high IgG levels. These findings indicate that antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and antibody levels may act as complementary but not directly correlated arms of immunity. Microbiota profiling via sPLS-DA suggested weak but distinct microbial signatures associated with immune responsiveness, particularly enrichment of taxa such as Alistipes and Romoutsia among high-antibody responders. These findings emphasize that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is immunogenic and well tolerated in breast cancer patients under therapy and highlight the need to further explore microbiota–immune interactions to optimize vaccination strategies in oncology.">

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces immune alterations that persist post-recovery, manifesting not only in long COVID (LC) but also in healthy individuals. Cytokines serve as critical orchestrators of these processes. The goal of this study is to investigate post-pandemic immune remodeling through cytokine assessment in both patients with LC and healthy donor, and to compare the post-pandemic population with pre-pandemic controls to find changes in the immune responses and cytokine profiles. A panel of 47 immune mediators (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) was measured with the MAGPIX multiplex analysis. LC was characterized by an increase in IL-7, IL-8, IL-17F, IL-18, EGF, FGF-2, PDGF-AA, sCD40L, and MCP-3 and a decrease in IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, IL-27, and FLT-3L. Comparing post-pandemic recovered individuals with pre-pandemic healthy cohort, we saw an upregulation of IL-13 and MCP-3 and a downregulation of MDC, M-CSF, IL-12, and IL-17F. While LC is characterized by persistent immune imbalance—particularly in cytokine networks—our data emphasize the critical need to study healthy donors in both pre- and post-pandemic eras when analyzing and interpreting these changes.">

Messenger ribonucleic acid-sequence was used to analyze the transcriptomic changes in tissues. Multiple inflammatory cytokines in tissues and inflammatory cells in the blood were detected on the fifth day post-infection. Our results showed that H1N1 infection caused significant liver pathology and elevated serum AST/ALT levels. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in liver gene expression profiles following H1N1 infection, particularly in genes associated with inflammatory responses, including those involved in monocyte adhesion/activation and neutrophil/macrophage infiltration. Marked increases in inflammatory mediators were observed in lungs, serum, and liver, accompanied by systemic changes in circulating inflammatory cells, indicating H1N1 triggered a robust systemic inflammatory response. These findings suggest that H1N1-induced liver damage may be associated with the systemic inflammatory response induced by H1N1 and changes in liver gene regulation.">

        <tr id="Background: Currently available immunological tests for SARS-CoV-2 assess only antibody responses. Despite the growing evidence that T cells play a crucial role in protection, especially against emerging viral variants, no routine test is available to determine T cell immunity. The prognostic value of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for determining whether individuals are immune and protected against disease remains uncertain. This is in part due to the following: (a) specificity and limitations such as the sensitivity of antibody tests, and (b) the lack of correlation between antibody titers (quantity) and the antiviral function of antibodies (quality). Approximately a quarter of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with symptoms fail to show seroconversion in serological assays. Methods: The current report describes the development and application of a whole-blood-based assay to detect previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Whole blood is stimulated with SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides identified during assay development and stimulation-induced cytokines quantified using a multiplex testing platform. The resulting cytokine profiles are generated using computational tools to identify previous exposure to the virus. Results: The application of the assay revealed a lack of self-awareness of individuals’ COVID-19 infection history and demonstrated the value of this new assay to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure history and immunity in populations. Conclusions: Positive responses in this assay can facilitate the identification of underlying causes of unexplained symptoms and provide clinically actionable insights for healthcare applications, including in the continued conundrum of post-acute sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC or “long COVID”), for which both diagnosis and management remain challenging.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a profound global impact, yet children exhibited distinct clinical and epidemiological patterns compared to adults. Pediatric cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were generally characterized by milder disease, lower hospitalization rates, and few long-term sequelae. However, a subset of children developed severe complications such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), highlighting the heterogeneity in disease presentation. Differences in immune system maturity and comorbidities likely contribute to the age-dependent manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, has been implicated in the emergence of new viral variants with immune escape characteristics due to ongoing viral replication in the presence of selective pressure. While SARS-CoV-2 evolution in persistently infected adults has been well-documented, it is less clear how the virus evolves during persistent infection in the pediatric population. To address this question, we performed viral whole genome sequencing of longitudinal specimens collected from immunocompetent and immunocompromised pediatric COVID-19 patients. Similarly to what has been observed in adult cohorts, mutations associated with enhanced viral fitness and immune escape arose intra-host over time. Intra-host diversity accumulated at similar rates in immunocompetent and immunocompromised children, though more mutations overall were observed in the immunocompromised cohort due to the longer infection time courses. Overall, we identified similar viral evolutionary trends over the course of infection despite clinical differences in pediatric COVID-19 manifestation and severity. This similarity suggests that persistent infection in children may be an additional, but not unique, source of ongoing viral diversification.">

Our previous study showed a 22% median increase in homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in obese individuals at 12 months post-infection compared to acute infection. This study aimed to investigate the association between various subsets of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8 + T cells and insulin resistance in convalescent COVID-19 patients over a one-year post-infection follow-up period. A nested case control study of 47 COVID-19 patients was followed for 12 months post-infection and categorized into three groups based on obesity and changes in HOMA-IR at one year: non-obese without increased HOMA-IR (NO), obese without increased HOMA-IR (O), and obese with increased HOMA-IR (O-IR). Increased HOMA-IR was defined as a HOMA-IR ratio (12-month to 1-month convalescence phase) > 1.21. To study antigen-specific responses, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s were isolated and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide antigens for 24 h. Intracellular IFN-γ expression, as well as exhaustion and senescence markers, in various CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. The abundance of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells was lower in the O-IR group compared to individuals without increased HOMA-IR during the 9th to 12th months of follow-up (p < 0.05). Conversely, the O-IR group exhibited a mild but significantly higher IFN-γ-expressing CD8+ T cells from the 3rd to the 9th month of the convalescence phase (p < 0.05). A reduced proportion of functional (PD-1−CD57−) SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed in O-IR group. Furthermore, the reduced proportion of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells observed within 12 months of convalescence were have significant weak negative correlation with HOMA-IR ratio as well as HOMA-IR value. Our study demonstrates that obese individuals with increased HOMA-IR exhibited a reduced proportion of IFN-γ–expressing functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells one year after COVID-19. This reduction, along with the decreased frequencies of both functional CD4⁺ within 12 months of convalescence, suggests a potential association between impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell function and the development of insulin resistance following COVID-19. These findings warrant further investigation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-11714-3.">

        <tr id="Toxocariasis, a neglected zoonotic disease caused by parasites of the Toxocara genus, represents a significant public health concern, with an estimated global seroprevalence of 19%. Despite the well-known respiratory symptoms associated with toxocariasis, the immune response in the lungs during toxocariasis is still poorly understood. This study analyzes both local lung and systemic immune response to T. canis infection and T. canis excretory-secretory antigens (TES) intranasal application in C57BL/6J mice. Lungs, blood, and spleens were collected at specific time points for histopathological analyses, flow cytometry, cytokine profiling, and gene expression studies. The systemic immune response was further assessed by cytokine measurements in splenocyte cultures and the detection of TES-specific antibodies. T. canis infection triggered severe pulmonary inflammation characterized by eosinophilia and mucus accumulation, with persistent inflammation lasting up to 28 days post-infection. Interestingly, this response was not solely driven by Th2-type interleukin production. Cytokine analysis of splenocyte cultures revealed elevated levels of IL-5 and IL-6, along with increased TES-specific IgE and IgG1 antibody concentrations. In contrast, TES application alone induced local eosinophil infiltration and upregulated genes associated with lung repair, though this response was less intense and shorter-lived compared to the infection. Our study is the first to present a comprehensive cytokine proteome analysis in mouse lungs during T. canis infection and stimulation by larval antigens, highlighting the key role of cytokines such as IL-5, IL-6, and IL-33. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of toxocariasis and underscore the need for further research into potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has converged with the HIV epidemic. Although immunocompromised patients show an elevated risk of death due to COVID-19 compared to HIV infection, the impact remains contradictory. One reason could be the use of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Patients with HIV receiving ARV, such as tenofovir (TDF), have fewer symptoms of COVID-19. In mice, bleomycin (BLM) induces acute lung injury, resulting in an acute inflammatory response similar to the cytokine storm and lung damage observed in COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the preventive role of TDF administration prior to BLM administration. A total of 64 eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, France), both male and female, were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n = 8 per sex per group): (i) oral TDF administered in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by oropharyngeal aspiration (OA) of saline on day 7 (TDF); (ii) oral TDF in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (TDF-BLM); (iii) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of saline on day 7 (SAL); and (iv) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (BLM). Animals were euthanized 72 h after OA (day 10), and serum and lung tissues were collected for analysis. TDF-BLM lungs showed significantly reduced bronchioalveolar lavage fluid total cell counts, specifically reduced macrophages and neutrophils counts, but an increased presence of minority lymphocytes. TDF downregulated BLM-induced levels of Il1β, Il6, TNFα, and Tgfβ mRNA. Preventive treatment with TDF counteracted BLM-induced alveolar and bronchiolar cell damage. Male mice showed more severe symptoms after BLM administration for most parameters, and the preventive action of TDF was similar in both sexes. Preventive TDF administration partially counteracted BLM-induced acute lung injury. These findings support epidemiological observations suggesting a potential benefit of TDF as a prophylactic therapy against COVID-19, at least in HIV-infected patients.">

        <tr id="Introduction A better understanding of post-exposure immune responses in vaccinated individuals, particularly infants, is needed. Methods Using a rhesus macaque model, we compared recipients of mRNA- or protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines administered in infancy with unvaccinated controls 7 days post-SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge. Mass cytometry profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and dissociated mediastinal lymph node cells at 7 days post-challenge revealed tissue-specific differences between groups, representing a snapshot of immune activity at this point. Results Vaccinated animals showed lower frequencies of activated CD8+ T cells in blood and lower levels of monocyte and B cell subsets in lymph nodes, aligning with lower viral loads and milder pathology. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells—commonly depleted in circulation during severe human COVID-19—were preserved in the blood of vaccinated groups. Ex vivo stimulation demonstrated heightened inflammatory cell signaling from unvaccinated rhesus macaques, correlating with worse clinical outcomes. Discussion These findings enhance our understanding of a critical nonhuman primate model and underscore the utility of single-cell, tissue-level analyses in evaluating next-generation pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="A 48-year-old patient underwent lung transplantation because of severe COVID-19, which aggravated his underlying interstitial lung disease, despite the presence of detectable SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, the graft is re-infected early in the post-procedural phase, leading to viral persistence for more than five months. By analyzing viral evolution and effector immune response within the transplanted organ, we observe three main findings. First, virus evolution differs in the transplanted organ compared to that in the upper respiratory tract and is affected by monoclonal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and molnupiravir. Second, we show the potential clinical relevance of T cell HLA restriction that may facilitate viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract compared to the ongoing viral replication in the HLA mismatch organ. Third, close monitoring and modulation of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy enables viral clearance in a lung transplantation setting despite incomplete SARS-CoV-2 clearance prior to transplantation.">

        <tr id="ntroduction. Recent studies have convincingly demonstrated the ability of the SARS-CоV-2 coronavirus pathogen to exacerbate the severity of cardiovascular diseases through the formation of cardiorespiratory pathology, partly due to endothelial injury. Purpose. To determine the impact of cardiovascular disease on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection in patients residing in southern Iraq. Materials and methods. An analysis of 120 blood samples from patients residing was conducted to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection in patients with cardiovascular disease manifestations and in patients with no confirmed cardiovascular pathology. A high-tech research method, the quantitative PCR (qPCR), was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. Results. The study found 95 positive and 25 negative samples for SARS-CoV-2. The positive blood samples contained RdRp, E, and N genes, and the cycle threshold (CT) depended on their identification. The highest number of positive samples was detected in autumn and in the first month of winter, mainly in patients aged 19–27, 64–72, and 73–81. A higher prevalence of viral infection was observed among women and patients with ventricular septal defects. Conclusion. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is influenced by patients’ age and the presence of clinical manifestations of cardiovascular pathology. The data obtained serve as a basis for planning further studies aimed at analyzing the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify the strains identified in this study.
 Введение. Исследованиями последних лет показана способность возбудителя коронавирусной инфекции SARS-CoV-2 усугублять тяжесть течения сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний вследствие формирования кардиореспираторной патологии, отчасти за счет поражения эндотелия. Цель. Определить влияние сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний на частоту встречаемости коронавирусной инфекции SARS-CoV-2 у пациентов, проживающих на юге Ирака, в зависимости от их возраста и пола. Материалы и методы. Осуществлен анализ 120 образцов крови пациентов, проживающих в провинции Ти-Кар на юге Ирака, на предмет выявления наличия коронавирусной инфекции SARS-CoV-2 у пациентов с проявлениями сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний и у пациентов с отсутствием констатированной сердечно-сосудистой патологии. Для выявления SARS-CoV-2 использован высокотехнологичный метод исследования – количественной ПЦР (qPCR). Результаты. По результатам исследования выявлено 95 положительных (в отношении вируса SARS-CoV-2) образцов, 25 образцов были отрицательными. В положительных образцах крови обнаружены гены RdRp, E и N, а порог цикла (CT) зависел от их идентификации. Наибольшее количество положительных проб выявлено в осенний период и первый месяц зимнего периода времени, преимущественно у пациентов в возрасте 19–27, 64–72 и 73–81 года. Большее носительство вирусной инфекции наблюдалось среди женщин и пациентов с дефектами межжелудочковой перегородки. Заключение. На инфицированность SARS-CoV-2 влияет возраст пациентов и наличие у них клинических проявлений сердечно-сосудистой патологии. Полученные данные служат основой для планирования выполнения дальнейших исследований, направленных на анализ всего генома SARS-CoV-2 для выявления его штаммов, идентифицированных в данном исследовании.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, spread rapidly across the globe in 2020, with most countries experiencing two distinct waves of infection. In Brazil, the second wave was marked by the emergence of the P.1 (Gamma) variant, which disproportionately affected younger individuals and was associated with increased mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological profile and post mortem histopathological lung findings, correlate them with laboratory results, and compare the first and second waves of COVID-19. To investigate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), we performed immunohistochemistry for citrullinated histone H3 (cit-H3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Our cohort included patients who died in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a single center in southern Brazil. The study included 42 patients, 24 from the first wave and 18 from the second, who died between March 2020 and August 2021. Laboratory data included complete blood counts and D-dimer levels. Histopathological analyses were conducted using H&E-stained slides and reviewed independently by two blinded pathologists. MPO and cit-H3 immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate NETs markers. All cases exhibited varying degrees of inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), with frequent microvascular thrombi. Neutrophilic infiltration was significantly higher in the second wave. Additionally, cases with intense neutrophilic infiltration showed a stronger association with thrombosis. NETs were identified in 10 cases. No significant correlation was found between histopathological findings, NETs, and laboratory blood count results. The histopathological findings were consistent with those reported globally. The second wave of COVID-19 showed higher neutrophilic infiltrate in the lung tissue. Neutrophils play a key role in the inflammatory response and NET formation might indicate an increased risk of mortality. Further studies can consider NET-targeted therapies as potential strategies.">

        <tr id="Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of human Q fever, subverts macrophage antimicrobial functions to establish an intracellular replicative niche. To better understand the host-pathogen interactions, we investigated the transcriptional responses of human alveolar macrophages (hAMs) infected with virulent (NMI, G), attenuated (NMII), and avirulent (Dugway) strains of C. burnetii. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that all strains activated proinflammatory pathways, particularly IL-17 signaling, though the magnitude and nature of the response varied by strain. Dugway infection induced the most robust transcriptional response and consistent M1-like macrophage polarization, while responses to NMI and NMII were more variable. Cytokine assays confirmed significant secretion of effectors downstream of IL-17 signaling, but only at later stages of infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed heterogeneity in macrophage response to C. burnetii infection, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting divergent inflammatory profiles. These findings highlight the complexity of macrophage responses to C. burnetii and underscore the importance of strain-specific and cell-specific factors in shaping host immunity. Understanding these dynamics may inform the development of targeted therapies for Q fever.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a global health crisis complicated by immune dysregulation and T cell exhaustion. CD39, an ectonucleotidase generating immunosuppressive adenosine, is implicated in cancer and chronic infections, yet its spatiotemporal role in TB pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Multiple publicly available datasets were utilized to evaluate CD39 across TB disease stages, diverse infectious diseases and anti-TB treatment. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated via ROC curves and combined signature analysis. Immune cell infiltration were analyzed using CIBERSORTx. Cytokine profiles and age-stratified associations were examined. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by GSEA. Single-cell analysis of non-human primate granulomas assessed CD39’s temporal dynamics, utilizing Monocle 3 for CD39+ T-cell trajectory analysis. Results CD39 was upregulated in active TB patients versus TB infection (TBI) and healthy controls (HC), correlating with older age, disease severity, and distinct expression patterns compared to other respiratory and systemic infections. CD39 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy over IFN-γ in distinguishing TB from TBI/HC and other respiratory diseases. Combining CD39 with TBX21 or GZMB further improved diagnostic specificity. High CD39 expression correlated with suppressed Th1 and elevated Th2/Th17/regulatory cytokines, alongside pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Age-stratified analysis revealed complex age-dependent associations of CD39 expression with various immune cell types. Single-cell analysis revealed declining CD39 transcriptional activity during prolonged infection despite expanded cellular distribution, linked to early T cell maturation followed by broader immunomodulatory shifts. Decreased CD39 expression with anti-TB treatment correlated with improved immune cell balance and resolved T cell exhaustion. Conclusion CD39 is a critical regulator of immune exhaustion and neutrophil-driven inflammation in TB, with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Targeting CD39 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for TB.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a 1.7-fold higher arrhythmia risk with rates of cardiac complications ranging from 2% non-ICU patients to 59% in non-survivors. Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is a frequent complication of acute and long COVID-19. The high expression of ACE2 in the heart suggested that infectious virus may underlie cardiac complications. However, we recently reported in human cardiac tissue from fatal COVID-19 cases perivascular spike protein, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, vascular damage, and cardiac remodeling without evidence for direct infection of cardiac cells by SARS-CoV2. Mislocalization of intercalated disc (ID) components, connexin-43 (Cx43) gap junctions and NaV1.5 sodium channels, was also evident in patients’ hearts, recapitulating structural remodeling we previously identified as providing a substrate for atrial arrhythmias following an acute inflammatory insult. Therefore, we hypothesized that the inflammatory response elicited by SARS-CoV2 spike protein is sufficient to provoke atrial arrhythmias. Structural and functional assessments of WT murine hearts were performed five days following a single bolus intravenous injection of the viral spike protein. In vivo ECGs demonstrated increased atrial arrhythmia burden in spike-injected mice vs. control. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed elevated expression of inflammatory markers and evidence of vascular damage in these mice. Additionally, we observed disruption of ID ultrastructure and mislocalization of Cx43 and NaV1.5 in the atria of spike protein-injected mice. Our results suggest that vascular-leak inducing inflammatory insult from viral spike protein, and not direct infection by SARS-CoV2 results in the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in fatal COVID-19.

        <tr id="Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted investigation into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in lung cancer patients. Understanding this interplay is crucial for optimizing cancer immunotherapy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on lung cancer patients, characterizing changes in peripheral immune cells and plasma cytokines (including IL-10 and IL-12p70) before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between ICI-treated patients with and without COVID-19. Cytokine dynamics were further analyzed in a non-infected cohort. Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a prolonged systemic cytokine storm, with elevated IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels and reduced monocyte proportions lasting up to 10 weeks post-recovery. Despite this immune perturbation, COVID-19 did not impair long-term PFS; instead, a transient improvement in disease control was observed in infected patients. In non-infected patients, sustained or increased IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels during ICI therapy were associated with longer PFS (p < 0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection transiently alters the immune landscape in lung cancer patients without compromising ICI efficacy. The sustained elevation of IL-10 and IL-12p70 may contribute to short-term clinical benefits. Monitoring cytokine dynamics could serve as a prognostic tool for predicting ICI response.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had unprecedented impacts on public health and the economy. Many studies have focused on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, particularly the spike (S) protein mediated receptor engagement and subsequent virus-host membrane fusion dynamics. However, the mechanistic contribution of cholesterol within spike-incorporated viral envelopes to infectivity has not been well characterized. Herein, we show that targeted cholesterol depletion from the viral envelopes of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV directly impaired viral infectivity in a dose-dependent manner. Although modulation of host cell membrane cholesterol exerted relatively minor effects on viral entry, host cellular cholesterol homeostasis critically governs progeny virion infectivity by determining cholesterol content within nascent viral envelopes. Virions derived from cells with reduced plasma membrane cholesterol demonstrate significantly attenuated infectivity in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. In addition, we detected that exogenous cholesterol replenishment restored SARS-CoV-2 entry efficiency by augmenting virus attachment. Collectively, our data demonstrate that biophysical properties of human coronavirus envelopes, particularly cholesterol stoichiometry, function as a key molecular determinant regulating host cell susceptibility. These findings position viral lipidome remodeling as a viable therapeutic target for developing host-directed broad-spectrum antivirals.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Neuroinflammation is a common pathological hallmark of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and epilepsy; however, their shared immunogenomic mechanisms remain poorly defined. This study explores shared immune-inflammatory transcriptomic signatures and identifies potential repositioning therapeutics. Methods: We integrated single-cell RNA-seq data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients and healthy donors (GSE149689), and bulk RNA-seq data from hippocampal tissue of patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with Hippocampal Sclerosis (TLE-HS) and healthy controls (GSE256068). Common Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified and subjected to GO/KEGG enrichment, a PPI network, hub gene detection (cytoHubba), and transcriptional regulation analysis (ENCODE-based TF/miRNA networks). Drug repositioning was performed using the LINCS L1000 database. Results: We identified 25 DEGs shared across datasets, including 22 upregulated genes enriched in cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, NF-κB, and Toll-like receptor pathways. PPI analysis revealed a CX3CR1–TLR4-centered immune module. Gabapentin emerged as a promising repositioning candidate with potential to downregulate CX3CR1, TLR4, and selectin P ligand (SELPLG). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis confirmed the diagnostic value of these targets (AUC > 0.90 in epilepsy). A mechanistic model was proposed to illustrate Gabapentin’s dual action on microglial polarization and cytokine suppression. Conclusions: Our results reveal a shared CX3CR1–TLR4–NF-κB inflammatory axis in COVID-19 and epilepsy, supporting Gabapentin as a potential dual-action immunomodulator. These findings reveal a previously underappreciated immunomodulatory role for Gabapentin, providing mechanistic rationale for its repositioning in neuroinflammatory conditions beyond seizure control.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel member of the Coronaviridae family. The viral genome encodes both structural proteins, such as spike, membrane, hemagglutinin, and envelope, as well as non-structural proteins that include auxiliary proteins and replicase essential for viral replication. While immunization campaigns have mitigated the spread of the virus, therapeutic interventions remain critical for managing outbreaks and preventing long-term health consequences. Despite extensive global research into the genome, structure, entry process, and replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, key aspects such as the roles of membrane lipids in viral entry, packaging, and release, as well as the metabolic alterations in infected cells, remain poorly understood. Epigenetics, the study of heritable phenotypic changes driven by genetic and non-genetic factors, plays a pivotal role in shaping host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone methylation and acetylation, DNA and RNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation, significantly influence gene expression in infected host cells. These reversible changes orchestrate the host’s antiviral responses and potentially alter susceptibility to COVID-19. This review delves into the immuno-epigenetic modifications occurring in hosts infected with SARS-CoV-2, providing insights into how these changes trigger viral replication and infection processes. By examining the current state of research on the immune-epigenetic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we highlight the mechanisms by which these modifications affect the host-viral interplay. Furthermore, we propose potential therapeutic targets within the immune-epigenetic pathways that could enhance ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms will not only provide a deeper perspective on the virus’s pathogenic strategies but also offer innovative approaches to improve therapeutic interventions. By addressing the gaps in knowledge surrounding immune-epigenetic factors, this review aims to contribute to the development of novel strategies for preventing and managing coronavirus infections and its variants.">

        <tr id="Cell cultures are widely used to study infectious respiratory diseases and to test therapeutics; however, they do not faithfully recapitulate the architecture and complexity of the human respiratory tract. Lung organoids have emerged as an alternative model that partially overcomes this key disadvantage. Lung organoids can be cultured in various formats that offer potential for studying highly pathogenic viruses. However, the effects of these different formats on virus infection remain unexplored, leaving their relative value unclear. In this study, we generated primary lung organoids from human donor cells and used them to derive monolayers and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with the goal of comparing the replication kinetics of two circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection studies revealed that organoid-derived monolayers displayed limited infection, and the innate immune response was impaired against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not against virus-like double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or poly(I:C). Meanwhile, organoids and organoid-derived ALI cultures retained viral permissivity, with ALI cultures displaying diverse antiviral immune responses against both coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV demonstrated differential replication kinetics in organoid and organoid-derived ALI cultures. Therefore, primary organoid-derived cells in two-dimensional monolayer or three-dimensional ALI formats influence virus infection and host antiviral responses. Our study informs the selection of culture conditions for organoid-based respiratory disease research and therapeutic testing.


IMPORTANCE
The COVID-19 pandemic heralded the upsurge in human-derived lung organoid-based studies due to their cellular heterogeneity that partly emulates the cellular complexity of the respiratory tract. A major disadvantage of organoid models resides in their apical-in conformation that "hides" cells and proteins that are typically exposed to the air-liquid interface (ALI) in the airways and are targets of viruses. Here, we generated monolayers and ALI cultures to facilitate cell exposure to highly relevant pathogens and compared them to parental organoids. Organoids at the ALI captured infection and immune responses better than organoids and organoid-derived monolayer cultures. Organoids at the ALI are a viable approach to improve identification and characterization of virus infection, host responses, and therapeutic testing.">

        <tr id="Although Torque Teno Viruses (TTVs) were initially considered to be ubiquitous members of the mammalian virome, the finding that swine TTVs (TTSuV) can act as primary pathogens elevates the possible status of swine TTVs (TTSuVs) to an emerging swine pathogen. Since their discovery, the molecular mechanisms of TTV–host interactions remain largely unknown as robust in vitro culture systems and in vivo animal models have not been available. This study was undertaken to address some of these long-standing gaps. Recombinant TTSuV1 rescued from an infectious clone was used to infect C57BL/J6 mice. Infected mice seroconverted within 15 days post-infection and mounted virus neutralizing antibody responses. Viral DNA was detected in blood and lung tissue for the duration of the study. TTSuV1 isolated from the lung tissue of infected mice productively and serially infected PK-15 cells in vitro, indicating that the treatment produced viable, replicative viral particles in the host. TTSuV1 antigen was also detected by flow cytometry in lymphocytes, including the T and B lymphocyte subsets. Infected mice exhibited mild splenic hyperplasia and lymphopenia. The ability to respond to mitogenic stimuli was highly diminished in infected mice and a striking lack of virus-specific recall responses was observed for the 30-day duration of the study. Therefore, this study is the first to provide experimental evidence that recombinant TTSuV1 rescued from an infectious clone is infective and induces immune responses in laboratory mice. This model provides a critical tool for advancing research on TTV immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Ending of COVID-19 pandemic does not exclude subsequent breakthrough infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutations increased with emerging omicron strain and exceeds those of the influenza virus. It remains unclear what IgG antibody levels are able to protect against new mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains, and how long the immune protection will last. The objective of this study was to monitor the maintenance of humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens over 4 years after the infection. Thirty-two adult reconvalescents after COVID-19 were annually examined for humoral and cellular immunity markers to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Humoral immunity was assessed by ELISA; cellular immunity was evaluated by expression of CD107a on CD8hi lymphocytes after recognition of S protein antigens. A four-year observation of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 (SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan strain) and were in contact with a novel, freely circulating mutant VoCs showed that, 1 year later, all subjects retained the IgG antibodies to S protein, mainly the IgG1 subclass, but the antibody avidity index barely exceeded 50%. After a breakthrough infection caused by the omicron strain, the level of IgG antibodies to S protein increased significantly, along with sufficient increase of antibody avidity. The IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 antibodies to S protein occured in the spectrum of subclasses. The level of specific IgA decreased 1 year after the disease against their level after the primary disease. However, it was significantly increased to 4-5 PR after breakthrough infections. Cellular immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was detected in all subjects at 1 year after the primary disease. After repeated infection with the omicron strain, it increased significantly and remained at this level for the next year. By 4 years, it decreased to the level that was a year after the disease. Hence, humoral and cellular immunity to S protein does not fade away, but continues to persist, maturate, being maintained at a sufficient level. Upon exposure to a new VoC, it allows to endure such a meeting either asymptomatically, or as a mild clinical infection. In view of frequent mutations in the S protein, the role of T-cell responses in anti-infectious protection seems to increase significantly. When developing new vaccines, one should rely on development of cellular immunity.">

Fungal virulence in plant pathogenic fungi can be modulated by viruses that infect fungi, also known as mycoviruses. However, their impact on fungal pathogenesis in mammals has remained largely unexplored. Here, utilizing an A. fumigatus strain naturally infected with the double-stranded RNA virus, A. fumigatus polymycovirus-1M (AfuPmV-1M), we found that the mycovirus confers a substantial survival advantage to the fungus under oxidative stress, heat stress and within the murine lung. Virus-cured fungal strains exhibited reduced conidiation, melanin production and levels of proteins involved in RNA metabolism and stress response, resulting in diminished fitness and virulence in mice. Finally, antiviral treatment during infection reduced AfuPmV-1M viral load, leading to improved survival in infected mice. Taken together, these data suggest that mycoviruses play an important and often underappreciated role as molecular ‘backseat drivers’ in fungal fitness, stress tolerance and disease progression.">

        <tr id="With the unprecedented surge of severe COVID-19 cases in early 2020, researchers and medical professionals worked actively to identify effective viral infection treatments based on a scientific understanding of viruses. Over the past few years, an enormous amount of research has investigated the viral infection and replication processes following the first SARS-CoV-2 case. With this knowledge, many drugs have been explicitly created to inhibit viral replication or decrease the severity of the immune response. Additionally, scientists have utilized decades of research and techniques to expedite SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. SARS-CoV-2, a positive-strand RNA virus, belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgroup of Betacoronaviruses. Its emergence is not unique; previous outbreaks like SARS and MERS have shaped our understanding of coronavirus-related diseases. Molecular clock analysis suggests that the ancestor of all current coronaviruses existed over 10,000 years ago, with subsequent evolution occurring around 3300–2400 BC. Researchers have explored synthetic and natural treatments alongside other antiviral therapies, corticosteroids, and immunotherapies. Additionally, using artificial intelligence and nano-based technologies enriched SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and management. In this comprehensive review, we provide recent literature on COVID-19, exploring its evolving etiology, pathogenicity, and pathophysiology, alongside developments in synthetic and natural therapeutic strategies, vaccines, artificial intelligence in diagnosis, and nano-based technologies.">

        <tr id="Summary We performed a large-scale immunogenomic analysis of ~13,000 transcriptomic profiles from 10 autoimmune diseases, integrating publicly available datasets from both blood and tissue. Using meta-analysis, we identified core immune mechanisms underlying autoimmunity, including strong interferon responses, inflammation, and adaptive immune suppression, alongside disease-specific signatures. To enhance biological interpretability, we derived higher-order immune features - such as cell type proportions, cytokine levels, pathway activity, transcription factor regulation, and miRNA activity - and organized them into 15 coherent immune modules. These modules enabled systematic cross-disease comparisons, revealing shared and distinct immunopathological patterns. The inflammation module, in particular, was associated with disease severity and predicted treatment response across multiple conditions. This modular framework offers a powerful tool for understanding immune dysregulation and advancing precision medicine in autoimmune diseases. To support reproducibility and enable others to build upon this work, we developed an interactive app to explore and download the complete dataset and associated results.">

We recently showed that HIV-1 promotes the ubiquitination of the amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), termed C99, to counteract its inhibitory effects on infection, but how and why C99 suppresses HIV-1 replication remains unclear. Here, we show that APP and Gag processing intersect and compete for two key components of the cellular sorting machinery, TSG101 and VPS4A. This in turn underlies the negative interplay between HIV-1 Gag and APP processing, whereby the need to replicate in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) increases amyloidogenic processing of APP and C99 in infected microglia.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review examines the role of heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) in COVID-19, highlighting its impact on immune modulation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Hsp60, a chaperone protein essential for protein folding and protection against cell stress, has been linked to COVID-19 pathogenesis through its interactions with the immune system and potential involvement in post-infectious autoimmune processes. One of the key aspects discussed is the phenomenon of molecular mimicry, wherein Hsp60 exhibits epitope similarity with a number of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, a circumstance that may potentially culminate in the induction of autoimmune responses. This mimicry has the potential to contribute to the development of autoimmune conditions, including Guillain–Barré syndrome and autoimmune thyroiditis, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The document discusses Hsp60’s role in endothelial damage and thromboembolic complications, suggesting it could serve as a biomarker for disease severity and a therapeutic target. It raises concerns about vaccine safety due to Hsp60’s structural similarity to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which may trigger autoimmune responses. The potential for Hsp60 to generate anti-tumor immunity is explored, indicating that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 might also target tumor cells with similar epitopes. Further research is necessary to understand Hsp60’s role in disease fully and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with immune dysfunction, but how disease-intrinsic mechanisms in treatment-naive patients influence the coordination of adaptive responses to novel antigens remains unclear. Here, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell immunity in 38 treatment-naive CLL patients and 13 healthy controls (HCs) following vaccination. Despite significantly reduced total immunoglobulin levels compared to HCs, 94.7% of CLL patients developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, and 89.5% mounted IgA responses, with serum titers comparable to those of HCs. Virus-specific T cell responses, measured by IFN-γ release following antigen stimulation, were detected in 78.9% of patients. CLL patients had significantly more circulating CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells than HCs. These expansions correlated with B cell abundance, which, in untreated CLL, predominantly reflects malignant B cells. Notably, Tfh cell frequencies and absolute counts were highest in patients lacking a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, indicating a decoupling between Tfh expansion and functional antiviral immunity.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which play a vital role in triggering innate immune responses such as the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs). While modest PRR activation helps to defend against SARS-CoV-2, excessive or sustained activation can cause harmful inflammation and contribute to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Altered expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are among the most important members of the PRR family members, particularly TLRs 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9, has been strongly linked to COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), collectively known as RLRs (RIG-I-like receptors), act as sensors that detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The expression of these receptors, as well as that of different DNA sensors, varies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Changes in PRR expression, particularly that of TLRs, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), and the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), have also been shown to play a role in the development and persistence of long COVID (LC). However, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved strategies to evade PRR recognition and subsequent signaling pathway activation, contributing to the IFN response dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Nevertheless, PRR agonists and antagonists remain promising therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review aims to describe the PRRs involved in recognizing SARS-CoV-2, explore their expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and examine their role in determining the severity of both COVID-19 and long-term manifestations of the disease. It also describes the strategies developed by SARS-CoV-2 to evade PRR recognition and activation. Moreover, given the considerable interest in modulating PRR activity as a novel immunotherapy approach, this review will provide a description of PRR agonists and antagonists that have been investigated as antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to explore the complex interplay between PRRs and SARS-CoV-2 in depth, considering its implications for prognostic biomarkers, targeted therapeutic strategies and the mechanistic understanding of long LC. Additionally, it outlines future perspectives that could help to address knowledge gaps in PRR-mediated responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection was responsible for the pandemic COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) and caused a range of symptoms, including gastrointestinal disorders and abdominal pain, making COVID-19 a multi-organ dysfunction. It is known that the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is expressed also in the gut, where SARS-CoV-2 could induce vascular damage and immune system dysregulation, similarly to what has been widely described in the lung1. This case report concerns a middle-aged man admitted to the Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy) and tested negative to the nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks after recovering from the infection. Due to thrombotic and hemorragic gut conditions, accompanied by severe ulceration, the patient underwent resection of a segment of ileum. Immunohistochemical analyses showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared to the non-ulcerated one2. Moreover, expression and co-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibronectin (FN) were analyzed. VEGF expression was increased in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared with control and non-ulcerated ileum. FN staining was progressively increasing in non-ulcerated and ulcerated ileum. By electron microscopy the microvilli alteration of brush border and of intercellular junctions were detected in the ulcerated area but not in other areas of patient’s ileum or in the control sample. The salient aspect of this study is that although the patient was declared negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the respiratory level, SPIKE and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins were still present in the ileum, concentrated in the ulcerated area and parallelled by an increased expression of vascular markers. The ultrastructural analysis gave insights on the morpho-functional effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection on the gut epithelium, indicating that the damage is not limited to vascular structures.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Cytokine storm can result from uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokines released in SARS-CoV-2 infection that cause damage to several organs. Il-6 is one of the major mediators of cytokine storm. IFN-α2 has been reported to have anti-viral potential and the pre-infection levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been suggested to drive the fate of the disease. There is a paucity of information on how anti-viral cytokines at the onset of infection affect the disease progression. This study aims to profile IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-α2 expression levels for 44 days post-diagnosis and their effects on recovery.


METHODS
Peripheral venous blood was collected from 38 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants who came for diagnosis at the Center for Research on Emerging and Reemerging Diseases. IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-α2 levels were measured using a Luminex panel.


RESULTS
Males had higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load than females, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). Age-related variation was also observed, with individuals aged 40-60 showing significantly higher viral load than those over 60 (p=0.045). Cytokines analysis revealed that males had significantly higher levels of IFNα-2, IL-2, and IL-6 (p=0.0031, p=0.009, and p=0.022 respectively) than females upon diagnosis, with cytokines levels decreasing over time in males but increasing in females. Cytokine levels trended higher in symptomatic individuals, although differences were not significant.


CONCLUSION
These findings highlight the influence of sex, clinical status, and viral load on cytokine dynamics in COVID-19, with potential implications for understanding disease severity and immune response.">

        <tr id="Interleukin-24 (IL-24) is a cytokine known for its role in immune regulation and apoptosis, with potential implications in viral infections like COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the association between IL-24 serum levels and the severity of COVID-19 disease. In this prospective bi-center cross-sectional study, we enrolled 41 COVID-19 patients from two hospitals in Germany. Serial blood samples were collected from a subset of patients, resulting in 88 total blood samples. Patients were categorized into critical, severe, moderate, and mild disease groups based on WHO criteria. IL-24 serum levels were measured during the acute or convalescent phase using an ELISA assay. Inflammatory markers, and kidney and liver function parameters were also evaluated. Statistical analysis included non-parametric tests and correlation analysis. Elevated IL-24 serum levels were observed in ambulant patients (mild disease), compared to hospitalized patients (critical, severe, moderate disease, p < 0.05). IL-24 levels were also significantly higher in patients without oxygenation disorder compared to those with oxygenation therapy (p < 0.05). A negative correlation was found between IL-24 levels and markers of inflammation and liver/kidney function. Elevated IL-24 serum levels were associated with milder COVID-19 courses, suggesting a protective role in modulating immune responses and promoting antiviral apoptosis. Conversely, reduced IL-24 in severe cases may reflect impaired immune regulation, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), marked by persistent symptoms lasting weeks to months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, affects multiple organ systems including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and renal systems. These prolonged effects stem from chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and direct viral injury. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)—small non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation—play a pivotal role in this process by modulating immune responses, inflammation, and cellular stress. Altered miRNA expression patterns during and after infection contribute to the pathogenesis of Long COVID. While conventional miRNA detection techniques have been valuable, they face limitations in sensitivity, throughput, and detecting RNA modifications. This review highlights Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONS) as a promising alternative, offering real-time, long-read, amplification-free RNA sequencing that preserves native modifications. ONS enables direct sequencing of full-length miRNAs and their precursors, providing novel insights into miRNA processing and regulatory roles. Despite current challenges with short-read accuracy, ongoing technical advances are improving ONS performance. Its integration in miRNA profiling holds significant potential for uncovering novel regulatory interactions and advancing clinical biomarker discovery in Long COVID and other conditions.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infections, leading to organ dysfunction and posing a critical threat to human health. Despite tremendous progress in understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis, early diagnosis and clinical treatment efficacy remain unsatisfactory. This study aimed to identify transcriptomic alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as potential biomarkers of sepsis.


METHODS
Bulk RNA-seq was performed on PBMCs obtained from 20 patients with sepsis and 12 healthy individuals. Multiple bioinformatics tools were used to identify key genes and signaling pathways associated with sepsis progression. The hub genes were further externally validated by publicly available blood transcriptomic data and experimentally verified by immunocytofluorescence assay.


RESULTS
Differential expression analysis revealed 4,522 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in patients with sepsis (n = 20) compared to healthy individuals (n = 12). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified multiple gene modules closely related to sepsis, with the royal blue module exhibiting the most positive correlation with sepsis. Intersection analysis yielded 176 common genes between the royal blue module genes and DEGs. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed five hub genes (CTSB, CTSD, ATP6V0D1, UBE2D1, and ATP6V0C) associated with sepsis. Immune infiltration was dissected by single sample gene set enrichment analysis, revealing associations between hub genes and monocytes. Single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis and immunocytofluorescence assay confirmed the upregulation of CTSB and ATP6V0D1 in circulating monocytes. Notably, CTSB and ATP6V0D1 were significantly associated with 28-day mortality of sepsis patients in the external validation cohort (n = 479).


CONCLUSION
This study identifies CTSB and ATP6V0D1 expression in circulating monocytes as potential biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets for sepsis.">

        <tr id="Microglia have a central role in the immunopathogenesis of neurobrucellosis where its activation is a hallmark in this disease. In this study, we present in vitro evidence that type I interferons (IFN) are involved in the activation of microglia during Brucella abortus infection and are necessary to induce neuronal death. Neutralization of type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) on microglia cells completely abrogates neuronal loss in primary co-cultures of neurons/microglia infected with B. abortus or treated with culture supernatants from B. abortus-infected astrocytes. Type I IFN regulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and subsequently nitric oxide (NO) production in microglia by increasing STAT1 expression and phosphorylation. Our results also show that NF-κB and the MAPK signaling pathways, ERK1/2 and p38, are implicated in the secretion of type I IFN induced by the bacterium. Finally, our results indicate that iNOS induction and NO production require activation of both NF-κB and STAT1 transcription factors. This observed molecular mechanism contributes to neuronal death induced by B. abortus-activated microglia and may help explain the neurological signs observed in patients with neurobrucellosis.">

        <tr id="The nasal cavity harbors diverse microbiota, and the nasal mucosal innate defense against microbial infiltration is crucial for respiratory infections. Both the nasal mucus covering the surface of the nasal cavity and the neutrophils beneath the nasal epithelia are the first line of innate defense against pathogens. Studying nasal mucus is challenging because of difficulties in collecting stable, high-quality samples from humans. Here, we investigated how nasal mucus cooperates with neutrophils to exert antimicrobial effects. Nasal mucus proteins, derived from nasal mucosal explants of goats, can promote neutrophil migration and increase their bactericidal activity. Calreticulin, identified from total mucus proteins, triggered ICAM-1-dependent transendothelial migration of neutrophils. Moreover, calreticulin activated the Rho GTPases of neutrophils via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 to promote their migration and further triggered the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in a manner dependent on TLR2 and TLR4, accelerating the elimination of pathogens. In vivo studies also demonstrated that nasal inoculation with calreticulin induced neutrophil recruitment to the nasal mucosa and accelerated the clearance of Pasteurella multocida. Together, these findings highlight the synergistic interaction between nasal mucus and neutrophils as an important protective feature in the nasal mucosa.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. Evidence suggests that microbial and nonmicrobial triggers for KD differ across geographical regions and environmental conditions. Although the precise triggers remain unidentified, KD is likely caused by microbial or environmental agents acting on genetically predisposed children. Recent Findings Insights into KD pathogenesis have also been derived from three well‐established murine models, which highlight diverse vasculitis‐inducing pathways. The diversity of microbial triggers supports the hypothesis that KD arises from immune‐mediated responses rather than direct infection. Pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), microbe‐associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and inflammatory cell death‐linked damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) play critical roles in KD pathogenesis. Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms associated with KD, such as ITPKC, CASP3, and FCGR2A, contribute to immune activation by promoting inflammasome activation, pyroptosis and antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE), thereby intensifying inflammation. Oxidative and nitrative stress further amplify inflammatory responses, with their interplay potentially driving KD onset. The relatively low recurrence rate of KD, despite its diverse triggers, may partly be explained by the presence of anti‐DAMP antibodies. Historically, reduced exposure to infections and improved sanitation may have led to lower levels of anti‐DAMP antibodies, potentially contributing to the increased incidence of KD observed over time. Conclusion Continued research into microbial and immune mechanisms is crucial to advance our understanding of KD pathogenesis.">

The authors used an autopsy platform allowing morphological and biochemical/molecular biological investigations in postmortem mirror blocks prepared from the brain and peripheral organs of 13 COVID and 23 non- COVID-infected patients. Microglia are resident macrophages of the brain, representing a ﬁ rst defense wall in the case of any type of bacterial or viral infection. 2 They possess G protein-coupled purinergic P2Y12 receptors (Rs) that sense ADP, arising from the enzymatic degradation of ATP that ﬂ ows out from glial/ neuronal cells after damage, caused by infections or metabolic disturbances. P2Y12Rs are localized at the membrane of the cytoplasmic processes of microglia; increased levels of locally generated ADP attract the active elongation of these processes to approach the sites of injury and later the migration of ameboid microglia to these sites. 3 Immuno ﬂ uorescence was used for quanti ﬁ cation of the levels of P2Y12Rs in the gyrus rectus of the frontal cortex and the medulla oblongata; a lower expression of this receptor was reported in COVID-af ﬂ icted microglia. The resulting shortfall in the recognition of ADP interfered with the defensive function of microglial cells.

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor in immune responses to infection. In malaria, severe disease risk increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. We assessed inflammatory cytokines during malaria in non-immune children and adults, and innate cell responses in vitro to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. We show during malaria age is associated with increased inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXCL9, along with CRP, and IDO, which associate with symptoms. In naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cells from adults have higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults are dominated by CCL2, while in children increased IL10 and enrichment of IL10 signaling pathways is detected. Findings identify age-dependent cellular mechanisms that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

        <tr id="Monitoring the presence and distribution of distinct immune cell populations is key in deciphering immunopathologic disease mechanisms. Considering the crucial role of myeloid cells in provoking hyperinflammatory responses associated with coronavirus disease 2019, a camelid-derived single-domain antibody specifically recognizing human signal-regulatory protein-α (SIRPα) as a biomarker for myeloid cells has been generated and radiolabeled with 64Cu, that is, [64Cu]copper-SIRPα-nanobody ([64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb), for in vivo PET imaging. In this study, this PET tracer was used and validated to monitor the temporal dynamics of inflammatory processes during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nonhuman primates. For further validation, the signal of [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb was compared with the signal of TSPO-targeting [18F]fluorine-N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide ([18F]F-DPA714). Methods: Six cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently monitored for 7 wk. We performed a baseline [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT before infection, followed by repetitive PET/CT on days 3, 10, 24, and 52 after infection covering the head, thorax, and abdominal region. Of the 6 macaques, 3 underwent additional TSPO-targeting [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT investigations at baseline and at days 2, 9, 23, and 51 after infection. Tracheal and nasal swabs were taken to monitor the course of infection, and changes in blood count and inflammatory mediators in the periphery blood were monitored. Results: Detection of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA from tracheal and nasal swab samples confirmed viral infection of all animals. CT scans identified initial pulmonary lesions 2 days after infection. [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT revealed increased tracer uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes of all animals, but not in the lung lesions, 3 days after infection. [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT showed increased uptake in both anatomically affected and unaffected lung tissues. The increased [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake in the spleen and bone marrow of all animals was more pronounced 3 and 7 wk after infection. We detected individual differences in [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake within the bone marrow and spleen, whereas [18F]F-DPA714 exhibited rather homogeneous uptake patterns. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb is a versatile tool for quantitative monitoring of whole-body distribution, temporal distribution, and accumulation dynamics of myeloid cell subpopulations even in moderately inflamed tissues and affected lymphatic organs during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Adipocytes can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, potentially contributing to the obesity-associated severity of COVID-19. Circumstantial evidence points to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the necessary receptor for adipocyte infection, but this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Using differentiated immortalized human preadipocyte lines that we developed, we found that visceral adipocytes express higher levels of ACE2 and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-mediated luciferase-VSV infection than subcutaneous adipocytes. Overexpression of ACE2 significantly increased infection, whereas knockout of ACE2 significantly decreased S-mediated infection. Visceral adipocytes at baseline were susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant); however, increased levels of viral transcript with time were not apparent. ACE2 knockout significantly decreased the susceptibility of visceral adipocytes to SARS-CoV-2, whereas overexpression of ACE2 resulted in increased SARS-CoV-2 infection and was associated with increased viral transcript levels with time, as well as induction of IL6, a marker of the proinflammatory response. Our results demonstrate that ACE2 confers susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection of visceral adipocytes. Higher levels of ACE2 in these cells may play a role in establishment of infection and a proinflammatory response, potentially leading to pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 has continued to spread globally since its outbreak. As the virus evolves, new variants affect the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments. Therefore, understanding and explaining the viral prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for developing effective public health strategies. Methods Genomic information from the SARS-CoV-2 network surveillance laboratories in Jiangsu Province in 2023 was collected. The impact of private mutations on binding affinity of the spike protein to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) was evaluated by Bioinformatic analyses, pseudovirus infection assays and Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI). The impact of private mutations on antibody escape capacity was evaluated through Pseudotyped Virus Neutralization Assay (PVNA). Results The major circulating SARS-CoV-2 sublineages in Jiangsu Province in 2023 included BA.5.2*, XBB.1.5*, XBB.1.16*, XBB.1.22*, and XBB.1.9*. Key private mutations analyzed were E748V in XBB.1.5.24, H146K and I210T in XBB.1.22.1, H146K + I210T, and L455F in EG.5.1/EG.5.1.1. Bioinformatic analyses, pseudovirus infection assays, and BLI results showed that L455F significantly increased the spike protein’s binding affinity to ACE2. PVNA results indicated that H146K and I210T enhance the antibody evasion ability of the XBB.1.22.1 spike protein, while L455F did so for EG.5.1/EG.5.1.1. However, E748V increased antibody neutralization sensitivity for XBB.1.5.24. E748V, I210T, and L455F became characteristic of their respective descent lineages GF.1, FY.3.1, and HK.3. The epidemic durations of FY.3.1 and HK.3 were longer than that of GF.1. Conclusions Continuous monitoring and functional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 private mutations can be an effective approach for explaining patterns of viral prevalence. This has significant implications for the timely formulation of prevention and control measures.

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections globally, particularly affecting infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. While recent advances in prophylaxis, such as long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal immunization, offer promise for prevention, therapeutic options for active infection remain limited. Severe RSV disease is often driven not solely by viral replication but by dysregulated host immune responses, including excessive cytokine production, T helper type 2 (Th2) and T helper type 17 (Th17) cell polarization, and impaired interferon signaling. RSV has evolved sophisticated immune evasion strategies, such as inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) via nonstructural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1/NS2), and interference with pattern recognition receptor signaling, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. These mechanisms result in attenuated innate immune responses and defective adaptive immunity, contributing to viral persistence, immunopathology, and recurrent infections. Moreover, age-dependent vulnerabilities, such as immune immaturity in infants and immunosenescence in older adults, exacerbate disease severity. Excessive immune activation leads to bronchiolitis, airway remodeling, and long-term sequelae including wheezing and asthma. Emerging immunomodulatory therapies aim to restore immune balance, targeting cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β]), the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, or inflammasome activity. Host-directed therapies and direct-acting antivirals are also under investigation. A better understanding of RSV–host immune interactions is critical for optimizing therapeutic strategies and designing effective vaccines. This review synthesizes current knowledge on RSV immunopathogenesis and highlights immunomodulation as a promising frontier for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Acute lower respiratory infections are the primary cause of global mortality in post-neonatal children. Most respiratory viruses primarily involve upper airway infection and inflammation, yet nasal responses are poorly characterized. Using a mouse model of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), we found viral burden was higher in nasal airways and exhibited delayed clearance. Despite high burden, there was low nasal expression of type I and III interferon (IFN). Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) from HMPV-infected mice showed lower nasal interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and nasal enrichment of genes negatively regulating IFN. scRNA-seq of COVID-19 patients confirmed lower ISG expression in upper airways. HMPV infection downregulated nasal expression of interferon regulatory factor-3, suggesting a mechanism for limited response. To rescue the quiescent environment, we administered type I or III IFN to upper airways early post-infection, leading to lower nasal HMPV titer and virus-specific CD8+ T-cell upregulation. Intranasal immunization adjuvanted with type I or III IFN improved immune response, reduced clinical disease, and enhanced viral clearance in HMPV and influenza infection. IFN adjuvant increased recruitment of dendritic cells, resident-memory T-cells, and neutralizing antibodies. These findings reveal locally suppressed IFN production contributes to a quiescent nasal immune landscape that delays viral clearance and impairs mucosal vaccine responses.">

        <tr id="Background The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 varies greatly among individuals yielding highly varying severity levels among the patients. While there are various methods to spot severity associated biomarkers in COVID-19 patients, we investigated highly mutated regions, or mutation hotspots, within the SARS-CoV-2 genome that correlate with patient severity levels. SARS-CoV-2 mutation hotspots were searched in the GISAID database using a density based clustering algorithm, Mutclust, that searches for loci with high mutation density and diversity. Results Using Mutclust, 477 mutation hotspots were searched in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, of which 28 showed significant association with severity levels in a multi-omics COVID-19 cohort comprised of 387 infected patients. The patients were further stratified into moderate and severe patient groups based on the 28 severity related mutation hotspots that showed distinctive cytokine and gene expression levels in both cytokine profile and single-cell RNA-seq samples. The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 mutation hotspots on human genes was further investigated by network propagation analysis, where two mutation hotspots specific to the severe group showed association with NK cell activity. One of them showed to decrease the affinity between the viral epitope of the hotspot region and its binding HLA when compared to the non-mutated epitope. Conclusion Genes related to the immunological function of NK cells, especially the NK cell receptor and co-activating receptor genes, were significantly dysregulated in the severe patient group in both cytokine and single-cell levels. Collectively, mutation hotspots associated with severity and their related NK cell associated gene expression regulation were identified.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are accompanied by a cytokine storm with type I interferon (IFN) as the main driver. Besides epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and infiltrating dendritic cells are target cells for IAV. IAV are classified into different strains, defined by their major surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). So far, 19 HA subtypes and 11 NA subtypes are known. However, it is not well understood, why infection with certain IAV strains results in a cytokine storm with severe outcomes, while other IAV strains only cause mild infections. In order to address this question, we investigated six seasonal and five highly pathogenic avian IAV (HPAIV) strains using primary human ex vivo isolated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), as well as in vitro differentiated myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and macrophages (type M1 and M2). Our data reveal that IFN-α production by mDC and macrophages but not by pDC is dependent on productive infection with the respective IAV strain. In contrast to IFN-α production in pDCs, IFN-α production by mDC as well as M1 and M2 macrophages is mainly induced by HPAIV strains, indicating that other immune cells apart from pDC might have an impact on induction of type I interferon as the main driver of the cytokine storm in the patients and the severity of the associated disease. Our findings may provide insights into the viral tropism and host response upon infection with different IAV strains and improve the understanding of the accompanied pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells represent a critical component of antiviral immunity, demonstrating remarkable adaptability during infections such as human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) and SARS-CoV-2. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics have revealed the clonally expanding NK cell populations with distinct functional profiles, blurring the traditional boundaries between innate and adaptive immunity. However, the functional heterogeneity and immunological significance of these clones remain incompletely understood. Our aim was to dissect clonal NK cell heterogeneity using published scRNA-seq datasets from hCMV-seropositive, seronegative, and COVID-19 patients, focusing on cluster-specific gene expression patterns. Our computational pipeline employed Seurat-based integration and high-resolution clustering of datasets from hCMV-seropositive (n = 5) and seronegative (n = 2) donors, along with COVID-19 patients (n = 2). We analyzed datasets using Seurat 5 in R. Quality-controlled data were normalized (SCTransform), integrated (batch-corrected), and clustered (UMAP). Differential gene expression (Wilcoxon test, log2FC 0.25, p-adj 0.05) and annotation were performed. In hCMV-seropositive individuals, we identified 12 transcriptionally distinct NK cell clusters exhibiting KLRC2 (NKG2C)-dependent organization, with specific clones showing either enhanced cytotoxic potential (marked by GZMB/GZMA upregulation), or unique inhibitory receptor profiles (variable KIR expression patterns). The hCMV-seronegative cohort displayed a simpler clonal structure with 9 clusters showing reduced KIR diversity but maintained distinct effector gene signatures. Analysis of COVID-19 patients revealed divergent clonal patterns: one patient showed reduced KLRC2 variability with prominent KLRC1 (NKG2A) expression, while another exhibited KIR heterogeneity without KLRC2 variation. Our analysis reveals distinct clonal NK cell populations in hCMV and COVID-19 contexts, characterized by divergent expression of activating and inhibitory receptors. These findings demonstrate infection-specific dynamics of clonal NK cell populations, highlighting their adaptive potential through differential receptor expression in antiviral responses.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Tens of thousands of severe COVID-19 cases are hospitalized weekly in the U.S., often driven by an imbalance between antiviral responses and inflammatory signaling, leading to uncontrolled cytokine secretion. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is a known immune antagonist, but its role in macrophage-driven cytokine storms is unclear. We demonstrate that N functions in a pathway-specific manner, specifically amplifying nuclear factor κB-related transcripts upon Toll-like receptor 7/8 stimulation. Moreover, we show that this is a conserved feature of pathogenic coronaviruses, with the delta variant N being the most pro-inflammatory. Our interaction networks suggest the delta variant N drives inflammation through interactions with several stress granule-related proteins. Profiling of secreted cytokines revealed that supernatants from the delta variant N-expressing macrophages disrupt brain and heart endothelial barriers, implicating N in COVID-19-associated cognitive and cardiac complications. Our findings highlight N-mediated immune imbalance as a driver of severe COVID-19 and identify N as a promising therapeutic target to mitigate hyperinflammation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Survivors of COVID-19 frequently report psychiatric and cognitive sequelae. The origin of such sequelae has not been determined, as it has been a challenge to resolve whether these symptoms have a viral origin or are related to the contextual stressors associated with the pandemic. In the current study, we used a mouse model of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) to evaluate the neurobiological nature of the sequelae without the interference of the contextual effects on behavior following SARS-CoV-2 infection.


RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in behavioral deficits related to cognition but not anxiety- or depression-like behavior. The cognitive deficits were affected by the severity of the acute disease. Cytokine and chemokine levels as well as kynurenine pathway metabolites were significantly altered in the brains of infected mice. Both cytokine/chemokine levels and kynurenine pathway metabolites correlated with the severity of the acute disease. Microbiome taxonomic profiling revealed significant differences between groups, suggesting that specific bacterial species may be associated with the development of PASC.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to cognitive deficits in PASC, influenced by the severity of the acute disease. In contrast, PASC anxiety- and depression-like behavior was not related to the viral infection itself. This could indicate that PASC anxiety and depression is more linked to contextual stressors related to the pandemic, rather than the viral infection per se. Additionally, our results points to a role of cytokines and in particular metabolites of the kynurenine pathway in PASC, suggesting their potential as biomarkers and targets for pharmacological treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Persistent symptoms and complications reported by many patients for more than four weeks after contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome. These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability. Methods In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level of p < 0.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software. Results Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="Background: This study aimed to analyze metabolic changes in blood samples from patients with confirmed COVID-19 to explore the correlation between metabolomics and cytokines in survivors and non-survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the complex biochemical and immunometabolic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for elucidating the pathophysiology and virulence of COVID-19. Methods: This study included 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 40 healthy controls. Serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS), and cytokine levels were measured using ELISA. Results: Our study defined three clear metabolic phenotypes among survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19 compared with healthy controls, which might be related to mortality, severity, and disease burden. A strong relationship was observed between certain inflammatory markers, including IL-1β, IL-2, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-17, and GM-CSF, as well as several metabolites, particularly in COVID-19 non-survivors, such as LysoPCs, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and serotonin. Different metabolite-cytokine correlation patterns were observed according to patient outcomes, indicating unique correlations between metabolic and immune responses in survivors and non-survivors. Metabolic phenotypes were associated with clinical outcomes, comorbidities, and sex-related differences. Kynurenine and related metabolites of tryptophan metabolism were closely correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and mortality. Compared with survivors and healthy controls, non-survivors displayed higher IL-6, together with distinct metabolic changes. These included increased kynurenine through the IDO1 pathway, elevated glucose and lactate reflecting hyperglycolysis and energy stress, and higher xanthosine from purine turnover. Stronger cytokine–metabolite correlations in this group point to tightly linked immunometabolic activation. Conclusions: Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct metabolic phenotypes that could be associated with the severity and inflammation levels of COVID-19. Correlation analysis between metabolites and cytokines demonstrated strong intercorrelations between specific metabolites and cytokines, indicating a strong interrelationship between inflammatory markers and metabolic alterations. Specific metabolic pathways associated with cytokines and their clinical relevance may serve as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious disease that has affected millions
worldwide. It often begins with symptoms related to the respiratory system, such as pneumonia that affects the small air sacs
and tissues in the lungs. But the virus doesn’t stop there; it can also impact other organs, including the kidneys and thyroid
glands. These organs have a special receptor called ACE2, which the virus uses to enter cells, making them vulnerable.
Currently, there’s limited information on how the pandemic might change kidney and thyroid health in the long run. This study
aims to shed light on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the thyroid and kidney health of residents in Oyo State, Nigeria.
We conducted a cross-sectional study focusing on individuals in Ibadan, exploring their thyroid and renal health after exposure
to SARS-CoV-2. Venous blood samples were randomly collected from 165 participants in different areas of Ibadan. We gathered
socio-demographic information and divided the participants into two groups: 85 individuals who were unexposed, testing
negative for both SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies, and 80 individuals who were exposed, testing positive for both. The renal
markers (cystatin C, urea, creatinine, electrolytes) and thyroid function markers (FT3, FT4, TSH) of both groups were analyzed
using an independent sample t-test. There was no significant differences (p > 0.05) found in the mean ± SD values of the identified
markers between individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and those unexposed. The findings suggest that individuals infected with
SARS-CoV-2 in this study experienced full recovery of renal and thyroid functions during the pandemic.">

        <tr id="In response to an infection, the host T cell compartment develops immunological memory to ensure rapid responses upon re-infection with the same pathogen. However, these memory responses can also modulate immune reactions to unrelated pathogens through bystander activation. Herein, T cells are activated in an antigen-independent manner, often triggered by innate cytokines or Toll-like receptor ligands. To uncover new strategies for modulating immune responses, it is essential to deepen our understanding of this alternative mechanism of T cell activation, particularly in humans. Therefore, we studied the response of human CD8+ T cells to innate bystander stimuli in vitro. Thereby, we measured the induction of activation markers and proliferation using flow cytometry, and depleted or blocked several potential modulatory components to identify mediators of bystander CD8+ T-cell responses. Our study demonstrates that CD8+ T cells can be activated as bystander cells in response to innate stimuli present during a viral infection, including IL-15, IFN-α, and TLR7/8 and 9 agonists (R848 and CpG). Depletion experiments demonstrated that these bystander responses are dependent on monocytes and CD4+ T cells. In addition, we revealed that the bystander responses to the innate stimuli are highly reliant on IL-2 signaling. Altogether, our study underscores the pivotal role of IL-2 in mediating bystander responses of CD8+ T cells to innate stimuli, revealing a novel mechanism of immune response modulation during viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background Pulmonary infections, ranging from mild respiratory issues to severe multiorgan failure, pose a major global health threat. The immune response in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and COVID-19 influences disease severity and outcomes, but molecular pathogenesis differs across pathogens. Comparisons of plasma cytokine profiles between CAP and COVID-19 are limited. Analyzing these profiles with machine learning and bioinformatics could reveal subtle patterns and improve our understanding of immune responses in both conditions. Methods We conducted a novel case–control study to profile cytokine levels in patients with CAP and COVID-19. Age- and sex-matched cohorts included 39 patients with CAP, 39 with COVID-19, and 20 healthy controls. We measured 384 plasma cytokine levels using proximity extension assays and analyzed differences between cohorts with conventional statistical methods, bioinformatics and machine learning. Results Median ages of the cohorts were comparable (P = 0.797). COVID-19 patients exhibited a higher prevalence of hematologic disease (P = 0.047), increased corticosteroid use (P = 0.040), and reduced antibiotic use (P = 0.012). Clinical outcomes, including mortality, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury, were similar between groups. Both cohorts showed comparable absolute circulating cytokine profiles but distinct profiles relative to healthy controls. Machine learning identified a model of twelve cytokines that distinguished CAP from COVID-19 with a classification accuracy of 0.71 (SD 0.20). Gene ontology and enrichment analysis revealed differences in cytosolic and nuclear functions, intracellular signaling, stress responses, and cell cycle processes between patient cohorts and healthy controls. Enriched GO pathways showed that CAP pathways were positively associated with leukocyte counts and ARDS development, while COVID-19 pathways were negatively associated with ARDS and positively with platelet counts. Conclusions This case–control study provides insights into cytokine profiles related to CAP and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Although absolute circulating cytokine levels showed no significant differences between the groups, machine learning identified a model of twelve proteins that effectively distinguished the cohorts. Gene ontology and enrichment analyses also revealed distinct dysregulated pathways with differing associations with clinical variables in each cohort. These findings underscore the complexity and variability of cytokine responses in pulmonary infections.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to far-reaching consequences. The changes caused in COVID-19 patients may persist for more than 6-12 months after acute phase of the disease promoting post-COVID disorders of immune system. Patients who have had acute COVID-19 in both mild and severe forms suffer from various manifestations of post-COVID syndrome. However, the severity of these manifestations is quite variable. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of lung damage extent in acute period of COVID-19 on the severity of clinical manifestations in post-COVID syndrome as exemplified by immune-mediated syndromes, i.e., autoimmune disorders, proliferative conditions, and allergopathology. 131 patients who had who had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were examined. Anamnestic data from outpatient cards of patients were used for the study. Using the ELISA diagnostics method, IgA, IgM, IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2, complement components C1q, C3a, C5a were determined. The studies revealed a connection between the severity of post-COVID syndrome and the severity of the acute COVID-19 course. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able of activating complement, and this activation persists for a long time (more than six months). This finding explains presence of clinical manifestations of post-COVID syndrome in individuals who have had a mild acute form of COVID-19 without CT-detected lung damage without phenotypes of immune system damage that we have previously identified (congenital – decreased expression of CD46 on T lymphocytes and decreased expression of CD46 on NK cells, and acquired – decreased level of T-cytotoxic lymphocytes and impaired level of B-cells CD45+CD3-CD19+CD5+CD27+). The data obtained indicate that the examination of post-COVID patients should be carried out not only by their clinical characteristics, but also by assessing markers of their immune system in order to make a correct diagnosis and prescribe etiological and pathogenetic therapy, including immune therapy. Conclusions: 1. Autoimmune, proliferative and allergic diseases are directly related to disorders of the immune system. The severity of autoimmune disorders in the post-COVID period is more associated with basic corticosteroid therapy (GCS) both for the treatment of autoimmune processes and for the treatment of COVID-19 (except of treating autoimmune thyroiditis). GCS treatment used in acute period of infection reduced the number of recurrenct disorders. The situation is the opposite in rheumatoid arthritis: the use of GCS in the acute period of infection in patients already on basic corticosteroid therapy subsequently leads to an increase in the number of relapses in post-COVID patients. 2. In post-COVID patients, we revealed a trend towards an increase in the most clinically severe allergopathology: firstly, in all groups (52%) in the post-COVID period, exacerbations of such pathologies as Quincke’s edema, urticaria, anaphylaxis, vasculitis, alveolitis, and bronchiolitis became more frequent. These findings suggest that the worse condition of these patients in the post-COVID period was influenced by the past SARS-CoV-2 infection Allergic skin lesions were in second place in terms of the frequency of exacerbations (about 28%). 3. There is a tendency towards an increased frequency of proliferative diseases exacerbations in patients with more severe forms of acute COVID-19 infection. It should also be noted that the percentage of such patients is quite high, from 31.6% to 48%. 4. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect the complement activation system, thus explaining clinical manifestations of post-COVID syndrome in the persons who had a mild form of COVID-19 without evidence of lung damage immune system affection. Our data indicate that the examination of post-COVID patients should be carried out not only by assessing their clinical characteristics, but also by examining the state of the immune system in such patients in order to make a correct diagnosis and administer etiological and pathogenetic therapy, including immune therapy.">

        <tr id="Novel therapies to treat infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), would be of great clinical value to combat the current and future pandemics. Two viral proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and the main protease 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), are vital in processing the SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and in releasing 16 nonstructural proteins, making them attractive antiviral drug targets. In this study, we investigated the degradation of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro by matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14). MMP14 is known to recognize over 10 distinct substrate cleavage sequences. Through sequence analysis, we identified 17 and 10 putative MMP14 cleavage motifs within the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and PLpro proteases, respectively. Despite the presence of potential sites in both proteins, our in vitro proteolysis assays demonstrated that MMP14 selectively binds to and degrades 3CLpro, but not PLpro. This selective proteolysis by MMP14 results in the complete loss of 3CLpro enzymatic activity. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus replication was inhibited in 293 T cells when either full-length MMP14 or its catalytic domain (cat-MMP14) were overexpressed, presumably due to 3CLpro degradation by MMP14. Finally, to prevent MMP14 from degrading off-target proteins, we propose a new recombinant pro-PL-MMP14 construct that can be activated only by another SARS-CoV-2 protease, PLpro. These findings could open the potential of an alternative therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially severe systemic inflammatory condition triggered by various immunomodulatory therapies, making understanding its pathogenesis critical for improving patient outcomes. Results/Methods By combining immunotoxicology and systems biology approaches, we offer a novel and integrative conceptual model of CRS as an adverse outcome (AO), induced by five different immunomodulatory biotherapies: 1) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, 2) checkpoint inhibitors, 3) T cell engaging bispecific modalities, 4) monoclonal antibodies targeting and activating T cell receptors, and 5) FcγR activating monoclonal antibodies. This model uniquely integrates multiple CRS-inducing therapies into a unified framework, offering a comprehensive mechanistic representation of CRS pathophysiology. For that, we built an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) CRS network for these therapies and then developed a systems biology map of molecular mechanisms relevant to the AOP network. The map of mechanisms is made available via a dedicated online platform for exploration and data visualisation. It includes 24 cell types, 425 entities and 430 interactions. Discussion Beyond a static representation, the CRS Map serves as a dynamic tool for clinical and research applications, allowing researchers and clinicians to explore CRS progression in detail, identify biomarkers, and discover potential therapeutic targets. The map demonstrates stages of CRS progression and shows molecules that can be measured in relevant immunotoxicological assays, as well as potential drug targets for therapeutic intervention of CRS.">

        <tr id="Pyroptosis is a mode of inflammatory cell death, characterized by cell membrane rupture and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Pyroptosis is a critical part of the innate immune response and acts as a defense mechanism against different types of pathogens, including viruses. Several respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, and SARS-CoV-2, have been shown to trigger pyroptosis through distinct mechanisms. While pyroptosis is beneficial to the host by controlling virus replication and eliminating infected cells, the exaggerated induction of pyroptosis can be harmful and cause significant tissue damage, such as that to the lung tissue during infection with respiratory viruses. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and the role pyroptosis plays during respiratory virus infections could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to reduce the morbidity caused by these infections. In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge obtained on the pathophysiological role of pyroptosis during different respiratory viral infections as well as some experimental approaches to regulating its detrimental effects to the host.">

        <tr id="Background Patients with hemato-oncological malignancies may respond insufficiently to vaccination, especially in terms of antibody titer. The antibody response depends on the type of malignancy as well as the type and timing of treatment. We intended to evaluate this using real-world data from patients of our regional hospital. This study also considers the role of immune status, including T-cell activation markers, in predicting vaccination success. Methods Seventeen patients of our hospital having a hematological malignancy were included in this study, including myeloma, lymphoma, as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL). All patients were vaccinated against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using Tozinameran following current recommendations. Circulating antibodies directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by a commercial immune assay. Immune status was determined from peripheral blood by flow cytometry. Both parameters were followed in fifteen patients who provided sufficient follow-up data for up to one year. Patients were categorized as responders or non-responders, and differences in diagnosis, treatment, and immune status were analyzed. Results Antibody response depended on both diagnosis and treatment. Active treatment directed against B-cells, such as anti-Cluster of Differentiation 20 (CD20) therapy, was associated with weak seroconversion. For CD38-as well as proteasome-directed therapies, the data suggest that responders as well as non-responders exist. Notably, low peripheral B-cell numbers and high CD3+HLADR+cell counts correlated with weak seroconversion upon vaccination. Conclusions We suggest that peripheral immune status can be applied as a predictive biomarker for seroconversion upon vaccinations.">

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies have investigated the inflammatory responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 2021, it was proposed that the cytokine storm observed in patients with severe COVID-19 may be initiated by sensing of cytoplasmic DNA released by micronuclei, which arises as a consequence of virus-induced genomic instability. Subsequent studies have described the presence of micronuclei and other genotoxic and cytotoxic markers in COVID-19 patients. However, the association between the development of a cytokine storm and cytoplasmic DNA sensing remains to be fully elucidated. In this review, we summarize current evidence on the dysregulated cytokine production in response to the detection of genetic material during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We focused mainly on the dysregulated production of cytokines induced by the activation of cytosolic DNA sensing pathways that promote inflammation. We emphasize the need to analyze the contribution of these signaling complexes to COVID-19 pathophysiology. DNA sensing amplifies the inflammatory response and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of severe disease manifestations observed in infected patients. Understanding this complex interplay can provide insights into potential therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating the hyper-inflammatory responses seen in severe COVID-19 cases.">

In this context, we aim to analyze the plasma proteomic and metabolomic profiles of unvaccinated nonagenarian patients who had severe manifestations of COVID-19 and either recovered or died and compare them with noninfected control subjects. Compared with healthy individuals, nonsurviving patients showed a reduced abundance of specific lipid-related proteins and metabolites, including APOH, APOC1, LCAT, 7-α-25-dihydroxycholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and phosphatidylethanolamine, which may serve as indicative markers of severity. Acute phase response, complement activation, and sphingolipids and phospholipids remain altered in recovered patients, indicating possible persistent effects of COVID-19.

        <tr id="Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large amount of data has been accumulated indicating a connection between this new coronavirus infection and the development of autoimmune manifestations in various organs and systems.The review includes data from foreign and domestic articles published in PubMed over the past 6 years, which are devoted to the role of COVID-19 as a trigger for the occurrence of systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases, including hematologic diseases.The development of autoimmune diseases (AID) after COVID-19 can be triggered by the infection itself, as well as vaccination. The emergence of AID is due to both molecular mimicry and immune dysregulation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The review provides a description of individual cases of development of different AIDs, as well as the results of a number of cohort observational studies covering a period of 1-2 years, which analyzed large data sets of patients with COVID-19 infection. A unique aspect of AIDs following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other previously known viral pathogens is the extremely broad spectrum of conditions observed. The timing of AID manifestation after COVID-19 is characterized by marked variability (from 1 to 15 months). Among the autoimmune blood system diseases, the most common are autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIH) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which can develop within a few days after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.">

        <tr id="Abstract The pathology of severe COVID-19 is due to a hyperinflammatory immune response persisting after viral clearance. To understand how the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is regulated to avoid severe COVID-19, we tested relevant immunoregulatory cytokines. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-4 were neutralized upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (CMA3p20), a model of mild disease; lung inflammation was quantified by histology and flow cytometry at early and late time points. Mild weight loss and lung inflammation including consolidation and alveolar thickening were evident 3 d postinfection (dpi), and inflammation persisted to 7 dpi. Coinciding with early monocytic infiltrates, CCL2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were transiently produced 3 dpi, while IL-12 and CCL5 persisted to 7 dpi, modeling viral and inflammatory phases of disease. Neutralization of TGF-β, but not IL-10 or IL-4, significantly increased lung inflammatory monocytes and elevated serum but not lung IL-6. Neutralization of IL-4 prolonged weight loss and increased early perivascular infiltration without changing viral titer. Anti-IL-4 reduced expression of Arg1, a gene associated with alternative activation of macrophages. Neutralizing TGF-β and IL-4 had differential effects on pathology after virus control. Lung perivascular infiltration was reduced 7 dpi by neutralization of IL-4 or TGF-β, and periairway inflammation was affected by anti-TGF-β, while alveolar infiltrates were not affected by either. Anti-IL-4 prolonged IL-12 to 7 dpi along with reduced IL-10 in lungs. Overall, the immunoregulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-4 dampen initial inflammation in this mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that promotion of immunoregulation could help patients in early stages of disease.">

        <tr id="The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an acute, highly contagious, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) gammacoronavirus mainly transmitted to chickens through the intranasal route. Positive-sense ssRNA viruses primarily act on mRNA and enhance the replication of viral copies. We identified the nasal entry site of the IBV-QX strain and provided insights into the minimal viral replication in systemic organs. Here is an overview of its entry mechanisms and tropism in systemic organ tissues. It enters the host cells via spike proteins, which bind to highly expressed receptors in respiratory, renal, and gastric epithelial cells. Viral RNA primarily replicates in the host cell environment, where it is directly translated into viral proteins. The precise replication of the IBV-QX strain in gastric epithelial cells was previously unknown. Different IBV strains have varying tropism. For the first time, we revealed the key players involved in the microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway by transfecting gastric cells with the IBV-QX strain. Our findings suggest that the QX strain may bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors by circulating throughout the lymphatic system at the very least and influence the translation of argonaute2 (AGO2), Dicer, exportin5 (XPO5), and Drosha proteins. Taken together, QX viral proteins disrupt host miRNA biogenesis, leading to dysregulated immune and cellular responses that enhance viral replication and systemic spread, thereby enabling cross-organ tropism and multi-system pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="As the pediatric COVID-19 landscape evolves, it is essential to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes children to allergic disorders. This narrative review synthesizes current epidemiological and immunological evidence linking pediatric COVID-19 with new-onset atopy. Epidemiological data remain heterogeneous: large Korean and multinational cohorts report increased risks of asthma and allergic rhinitis following COVID-19, whereas U.S. cohorts show neutral or protective associations, highlighting geographic and methodological variability. Mechanistic insights provide biological plausibility: epithelial injury and the release of alarmin cytokines (IL-33, IL-25, TSLP) promote Th2 polarization and ILC2 expansion, while epigenetic “scars” (e.g., LMAN2 methylation changes) and hematopoietic stem cell reprogramming may sustain long-term Th2 bias. Cytokine memory involving IL-7 and IL-15 contributes to altered T- and B-cell homeostasis, whereas disrupted regulatory T-cell function may reduce tolerance thresholds. Paradoxical trade-offs exist, such as ACE2 downregulation in allergic airways, which may lower viral entry but simultaneously amplify type-2 inflammation. Together, these processes suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection could foster a pro-allergic milieu in susceptible children. Although current evidence is inconclusive, integrating epidemiological surveillance with mechanistic studies is crucial for predicting and alleviating post-COVID allergic outcomes. Longitudinal pediatric cohorts and interventions targeting epithelial alarmins or microbiome restoration may hold promise for prevention.">

One widely discussed aspect of these vaccines is their uniquely broad spectrum and increased incidence of adverse events (AEs), collectively referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). Although the reported PVS rate is low, the high number of administered doses among healthy individuals has resulted in a substantial number of reported vaccine-related injuries. A prominent manifestation of PVS is multisystem inflammation, hypothesized to result from the systemic transfection of organ cells with genetic instructions for a toxin, the spike protein, delivered with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). In this narrative review, we focus on endothelial cells in the microcirculatory networks of various organs as primary sites of transfection with mRNA-LNP and consequent PVS. We outline the anatomical variations in the microcirculation contributing to the individual variability of symptoms and examine the molecular and cellular responses to vaccine nanoparticle exposure at the endothelial cell level with a focus on the pathways of a sustained cascade of toxic and autoimmune processes. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying mRNA-LNP-induced AEs and PVS at the organ and cellular levels is critical for improving the safety of future vaccines and other therapeutic applications of this groundbreaking technology.">

Identifying sensitive and specific biomarkers, along with elucidating immune-mediated mechanisms, is essential for improving the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. To predict key molecular markers of COVID-19 using an established multi-omics framework combined with machine learning models.We conducted an integrated analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA sequencing, and proteomics data to identify critical biomarkers associated with COVID-19. The multi-omics approach enabled the characterization of gene expression dynamics and alterations in immune cell subsets in COVID-19 patients. Machine learning techniques and molecular docking analyses were employed to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets within the disease’s pathophysiological network.Principal component analysis effectively grouped samples based on clinical characteristics. Using random forest and SVM-RFE models, we identified clinical indicators capable of accurately distinguishing COVID-19 patients. Transcriptomic analysis, including scRNA-seq, highlighted the pivotal role of CD8+ T cells, and WGCNA identified related module genes. Proteomic analysis, integrated with machine learning, revealed 36 DEPs. Further investigation identified several genes associated with monocyte proportions. Correlation analysis showed that BTD, CFL1, PIGR, and SERPINA3 were strongly linked to CD8+ T cell abundance in COVID-19 patients. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that these genes could effectively distinguish between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals. Concordant findings from both transcriptomic and proteomic levels support BTD, CFL1, PIGR, and SERPINA3 as potential auxiliary diagnostic markers. Finally, AlphaFold-based molecular docking analysis suggested these biomarkers may also serve as candidate therapeutic targets.Preliminary findings indicate that BTD, CFL1, PIGR, and SERPINA3 are vital molecular biomarkers related of CD8+ T cell, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms and long-term prevention of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Extensive research has demonstrated the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on maternal-fetal outcomes. However, few studies have examined the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during organogenesis on human embryo implantation and subsequent development. Additionally, the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on the endometrial microenvironment, which is critical for embryo implantation, remains poorly understood. This study seeks to address these gaps in knowledge. Methods and findings We prospectively enrolled 971 participants undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) during the final two months of 2022, coinciding with the nationwide COVID19 outbreak following the end of China’s Zero-Covid policy. Patients undergoing FET during this period were at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during organogenesis. Based on self-reported symptoms and nucleic acid testing, 520 individuals were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 451 were uninfected. Consistent with existing literature, our study reinforced that SARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacted pregnancy outcomes, as evidenced by reduced clinical pregnancy (52.69% vs. 76.50%, RR = 60.506, [95%CI, 0.259 ~ 0.452]) and live birth rates (46.54% vs. 60.09%, RR = 17.865, [95%CI, 0.448 ~ 0.746]), alongside an increase in obstetric complications (35.89% vs. 27.37%, RR = 4.380, [95%CI, 1.055 ~ 2.223]). Seven fetal congenital heart defects (CHDs) were observed in the infected group versus one in uninfected population. Bioinformatic analysis of endometrial mRNA profiles showed SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly downregulated key endometrial receptivity molecules, increased natural killer cell and mast cell infiltration, and disrupted the balance of cytokine and chemokine. Moreover, our findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulated the transcriptional activity of endometrial SLC6A, a serotonin transporter, and ErbB-2, a mediator of serotonin-regulated differentiation in cardiac development. This disruption in serotonin signaling may underlie the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during organogenesis negatively impacts embryo implantation and development, primarily through mechanisms involving compromised endometrial receptivity and disruption of the local immune microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective Chronic systemic inflammation can lead to metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative complications, but the factors influencing it are incompletely understood. In this study, we evaluated several factors, including Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) and influenza vaccination, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and sex, that may impact systemic inflammation as assessed by targeted inflammatory plasma proteome analysis in healthy individuals. Methods Participants were randomised to BCG or placebo vaccination at the start of the Dutch SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemic in March/April 2020. They reported their influenza vaccination status for the most recent influenza season. Twelve weeks after BCG or placebo vaccination, we assessed relative concentrations of 69 proteins in plasma of 357 individuals. Results Both BCG and quadrivalent influenza vaccination were associated with overall trends towards reduced systemic inflammation in both sexes, but with a more pronounced effect in men. However, the impact on specific immunological proteins varied between BCG and influenza vaccinations. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the 12 weeks between randomisation and plasma sampling was also associated with overall trends towards reduced systemic inflammation, reaching significance for CXCL10 and TNF concentrations. Notably, individuals who had received BCG vaccination prior to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection did not exhibit this protein profile. Furthermore, elevated CXCL11 and OPG concentrations at 12 weeks were associated with subsequent respiratory symptoms during the additional 9 months of follow‐up. Conclusions Our study revealed distinctive alterations in the plasma inflammation proteome associated with BCG vaccination, influenza vaccination, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and sex. These findings are exploratory and hypothesis‐generating and warrant further investigation in well‐controlled longitudinal cohort studies.">

        <tr id="Background: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality during seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. Human infection with IAV can lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and numerous clinical and basic research studies have established an association between IAV and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). However, the treatment of IAV-induced PF fibrosis has not been studied and discussed. Methods: An IAV-induced PF mouse model was established. Herbacetin (HBT) was identified as the most effective compound in the in vitro study of seven components of Rhodiola rosea L. (R. rosea L.). The effect of HBT on IAV-induced lung injury and PF was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The binding between HBT and neuraminidase (NA) protein was investigated by biological layer interferometry (BLI) and cell thermal shift assay (CETSA). Results: Following IAV infection, the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway is activated, leading to the upregulation of fibrosis-related proteins that promote fibrosis. HBT exhibited a significant ability to reduce influenza virus-induced lung injury and fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HBT binds to the NA protein of the influenza virus, reducing viral infection and the activation of the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, thereby mitigating the formation of lung injury and PF. Conclusions: HBT represents a promising therapeutic agent for modulating influenza virus-induced lung injury and PF, marking a significant step toward the development of effective treatments for influenza-induced PF.">

        <tr id="Background People living with HIV are called immunological non-responders (INR) when their CD4+ T cell count is not restored to immunocompetent levels, despite successful viral suppression. INR have increased risk of progression to AIDS, non-AIDS related morbidity, and death. Impaired mucosal barrier function is a prevailing hypothesis for why INR among people with HIV (PWH) have persistently low CD4+ T cell counts. Objective To understand the molecular mechanisms behind incomplete immune recovery in INR, we analyzed gene regulation and protein expression in gut tissues from INR, immunological responders (IR) and healthy controls (HC). Methods The transcriptome was assessed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and the proteome was examined using shotgun proteomic mass spectrometry in mucosal biopsies from the sigmoid colon and terminal ileum. Results In INR compared to IR, we identified 3326 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the colon while no DEGs were observed in the ileum. Gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed that the DEGs in colon of INR, compared to IR, predominantly involved pathways related to immune response, metabolism, and cellular processes. Notably, GO analysis highlighted downregulation of genes associated with B cell-mediated immunity and adaptive responses in INR. Deconvolution analysis indicated that these transcriptomic changes were not solely due to shifts in immune cell composition. Proteomic analysis supported these findings, showing more differential protein composition between INR and IR in colon than ileum. These proteins are associated with the regulation of adaptive immune signaling and essential cellular processes, including cell signaling, tissue repair, and growth, all of which are characteristic features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Conclusion Our findings suggest that incomplete immune recovery during anti-retroviral therapy in PWH is associated with specific dysregulations in the molecular environment of the sigmoid colon, which may share mechanisms with IBD. The identified macromolecules may serve as potential targets for adjuvant treatment to improve the prognosis for INR.">

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, though no longer classified as a global emergency, persists as a major public health challenge in 2025 due to the continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. This paper reviews the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19, the critical interplay between obesity and disease severity, and advances in precision vaccination and therapeutics. Epidemiological and meta-analytic evidence highlights obesity as a significant independent risk factor for infection, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality, underpinned by mechanisms such as immune dysfunction, chronic low-grade inflammation, and obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, obesity is shown to impair vaccine-induced immune responses, complicating long-term protection. In parallel, updated mRNA and protein-subunit vaccines, alongside emerging monoclonal antibody and antiviral strategies, reflect the shift toward precision medicine tailored to vulnerable populations, particularly the immunocompromised. While monoclonal antibody efficacy has been undermined by viral evolution, novel agents such as pemivibart and vilobelimab demonstrate promise in targeted settings. Collectively, the findings underscore the importance of sustained surveillance, equitable vaccine distribution, integrated obesity prevention, and personalized medical interventions. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to adapt, long-term mitigation will require scientific innovation, public health vigilance, and commitment to global health equity.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a life-threatening syndrome involving dysfunction of multiple immune cell types.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to comprehensively depict the dynamic trajectory of immune responses throughout the disease course of HBV-related ACLF (HBV-ACLF).


DESIGN
Single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell proteomics were performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 45 samples from 17 patients who were hospitalised (progressive/stable/recovering course of HBV-ACLF, 6/5/6) and 15 control subjects (liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and healthy controls, 5/5/5). Functional and mechanistic experiments were validated in vivo and in vitro.


RESULTS
Single-cell multiomics analysis revealed specific changes in the peripheral immune response in ACLF. VCAN+CD14+-monocytes with activated interferon-stimulated genes and enhanced inflammatory functions, stimulated by HBV relapse and expanded in ACLF-1, fuelling early inflammatory storm. The subsequent apoptotic hepatocytes predominantly induce hyperinflammatory C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2)+-neutrophils and CD163+-monocytes, enriching in patients with progressive ACLF and serving as significant markers of disease deterioration. Cytotoxic T-cells were functionally impaired and significantly decreased in progressive patients. CXCR2+-neutrophils exhibited immunosuppressive activity and induced the exhaustion of cytotoxic T-cells. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 significantly reduced neutrophils infiltration, restored cytotoxic T-cells and showed therapeutic effect in ACLF mice. Six immune cellular modules (CMs) were identified for patient stratification, with CM2 and CM6 showing strong predictive value for disease outcomes, and CM3 indicating a potential early therapeutic window.


CONCLUSION
Our longitudinal multiomics study revealed the dynamic evolution of the immune response in HBV-ACLF and characterised diverse immune patterns for the future precise management and therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly impacted global health since late 2019. Beyond respiratory complications, the disease involves systemic manifestations driven by immune dysregulation, inflammation, and coagulopathy. Among the many mechanisms implicated in severe disease, a growing body of evidence suggests a central role for the imbalance between proteases and antiproteases. This review examines how dysregulated protease activity contributes to viral entry, cytokine activation, vascular injury, and thrombosis. We focus on the integration of proteolytic systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, coagulation cascade, and neutrophil extracellular traps with established pathways like endothelial dysfunction and immune hyperactivation. Furthermore, we highlight therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring proteolytic balance and discuss the potential relevance of this paradigm in the management of long COVID.">

This condition involves complex interactions between the virus, resident cells of the central nervous system and leukocytes recruited to the brain. We reviewed the mechanisms underlying leukocyte recruitment during flavivirus-induced encephalitis with a focus on the role of various chemoattractants and adhesion molecules. We discuss how these molecules orchestrate the migration of peripheral leukocytes into the brain parenchyma and how neurotropic flaviviruses induce this process. Moreover, we discuss evidence of leukocytes both controlling viral propagation and contributing to neuropathology, which poses a challenge for therapy development.

        <tr id="Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification and characterization of intracellular proteins with antiviral activity (known as restriction factors) is a key first step towards the future development of novel host-directed antiviral therapies. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity of 14 different interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) proteins against SARS-CoV-2. Overexpression of human guanylate binding protein (GBP) 1 resulted in potent inhibition of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, as well as against Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 variants of concern (VOCs). Moreover, knockdown or knockout of endogenous human GBP1 resulted in enhanced titers of SARS-CoV-2. While hGBP1 can restrict some viruses via actin remodeling, our data indicate that this is not the mechanism here. Moreover, we show that unlike GBP2 and GBP5, which impair spike protein processing, GBP1 did not reduce infectivity of spike-pseudotyped viruses following titration on Caco-2 cells. Multiple human GBPs have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro; however, we report no significant differences in virus titers recovered from the upper or lower airways of SARS-CoV-2-infected wild-type mice compared to from mice lacking the chromosome 3 cluster of mouse GBPs (GBP1/2/3/5/7). Together, our studies describe the ability of human GBP1 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, highlighting this host protein as a potential target for the development of host-directed antiviral therapies against this virus.IMPORTANCEViruses like SARS-CoV-2 can cause widespread illness and death. While currently licensed antiviral drugs are critical tools, drug resistance can develop. Our immune system produces intracellular proteins called "restriction factors" that can limit virus replication within cells. These proteins are promising targets for developing new antiviral therapies. In this study, we identified one such protein, human GBP1, which inhibited a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro, including Delta and Omicron. Interestingly, GBP1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 through a different mechanism to that of other human GBPs as it did not interfere with prosessing of the viral spike protein. Of interest, a cluster of mouse GBPs, including GBP1, did not demontrate significant antiviral activity in a mouse model of infection. Overall, our findings suggest that human GBP1 could be a valuable target for host-directed antiviral strategies and highlight the limitations of using mouse models to study certain aspects of human innate immunity.">

Analysis of the gut epithelial crypt zone by mass spectrometry-based tissue proteomics revealed a strong interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signal in active celiac disease. This signal, hallmarked by increased expression of MHC molecules, was paralleled by diminished expression of proteins associated with fatty acid metabolism. Crypt hyperplasia and the same proteomic changes were observed in wild type mice administered IFN-γ. In mice with conditional knockout of the IFN-γ receptor in gut epithelial cells these signature morphological and proteomic changes were not induced on IFN-γ administration. IFN-γ is thus a driver of crypt hyperplasia in celiac disease by acting directly on crypt epithelial cells. The results are relevant to other enteropathies with involvement of IFN-γ.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is the leading cause of death globally (49 million cases per year with a 25-30% morbidity and mortality rate), but its immunopathology remains incompletely elucidated. Conventional models of ‘uncontrolled inflammation’ fail to explain the diversity of immune status in patients at different stages of the disease, and there is an urgent need for a dynamic, time-series perspective to reveal key regulatory nodes. Methods Forty-six studies (2014–2024) were retrieved under PRISMA-2020 across 12 databases. Raw single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and CITE-seq matrices (≈1 million immune cells) were uniformly reprocessed, harmonised with scMGNN, and mapped onto pseudotime and RNA-velocity trajectories. Ordinary and stochastic differential-equation models quantified pro-/anti-inflammatory flux. Results Multi-omics fusion increased immune-cell classification accuracy from 72.3% to 89.4% (adjusted Rand index, p< 0.001). Three phase-defining checkpoints emerged: monocyte-to-macrophage fate bifurcation at 16–24 h, initiation of TOX-driven CD8+ T-cell exhaustion at 36–48 h, and irreversible immunosuppression beyond 72 h. Dynamical simulations identified two intervention windows—0–18 h (selective MyD88–NF-κB blockade) and 36–48 h (PD-1/TIM-3 dual inhibition)—forecasting 2.1-fold and 1.6-fold survival gains, respectively, in pre-clinical models. Conclusion In this study, an “immune clock” model of sepsis was constructed based on single-cell multi-omics data, which accurately depicted three key decision nodes, namely, monocyte-macrophage differentiation, initiation of T-cell depletion and irreversible immune suppression, and identified the corresponding molecular targets (e.g., IRF8, TOX). This model provides a clear time window and targeting strategy for individualised immune intervention in sepsis.">

        <tr id="Background The complement system is an important defense mechanism against pathogens, including viruses. In COVID-19, evidence suggests that hyperactivation of the complement system can lead to tissue damage and provoke dysregulation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in vascular damage observed in severe COVID-19. There is still little evidence regarding the role of plasma levels of these molecules in the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods The study included individuals 18 years of age or older with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, admitted to two referral hospitals in the Northeast Region of Brazil between August 2020 and July 2021. Plasma samples were collected within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were followed up until discharge, and complications during hospitalization were duly recorded. Plasma levels of the following complement proteins were determined by Luminex: C2, C3, C3b/iC3b, C4, C4b, C5, C5a, MBL, C1q, factor I, factor D, factor B, and factor H. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to correct the results according to possible confounding factors. Results The study included 267 patients (134 critical and 133 severe), with mean ages of 54 and 52 years, respectively. Plasma levels of C2, C5a, factor B, and factor D were significantly higher in patients who required intensive care unit admission, required ventilatory support, developed sepsis, developed cardiorespiratory arrest, or developed acute kidney failure. On the other hand, C4b level was lower in patients who developed complications. Complement proteins were significantly associated with laboratory parameters related to coagulation and kidney function. Conclusion These findings show that the complement system is associated with COVID-19 complications and laboratory parameters of coagulation and kidney function. These results suggest that these molecules may be potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in the clinical progression of COVID-19.

Stimulation index (SI) based on the percentages of CD4+ T lymphocytes with effector memory phenotype CD45RA−CD27− (TEM) was quantified by flow cytometry.Patients with IEI overall, as well as the two main groups of PAD [i.e., common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and isotype or functional antibody deficiencies (IOFD)], showed frequencies of responder individuals and median SI against SARS-CoV-2 comparable to HCHC. However, those IEI and CVID subgroups positive for anti-CMV T-cell immunity showed a significantly reduced response (SI) against S-peptides when compared to their IEI and CVID counterparts who were anti-CMV TEM negative.

Our results in patients with IEI and previous similar findings in healthy populations highlight the fact that when assessing immune-specific responses, the inclusion of CMV monitoring is suitable, is worthwhile, and may potentially be extended to vaccinations against different pathogens to prevent human disease more accurately.">

        <tr id="Roughly 1 billion people are infected by Influenza A viruses (IAVs) worldwide each year, resulting in approximately half a million deaths. Particularly concerning is the threat of IAV spillover from avian and other animal reservoirs. The recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in US dairy cows highlights this concern. While viruses that enter human populations from such zoonotic transmission typically lack the ability to transmit effectively between humans, they may be only a few mutations from acquiring this capacity. These newly adapted viruses have the potential to be significantly more virulent than seasonal strains. A major contributor to influenza pathology is the over-exuberant immune response to the virus, particularly when the infection is present in distal pulmonary tissues. Maladaptive immune pathway over-activation can drive tissue damage and pathology, often independently of effective viral control. Anti-inflammatories targeting host-initiated pathological processes hold promise, but these avenues require a thorough understanding of virus-triggered lung inflammation before they can be fully exploited. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the cell types that are targeted by IAV, the consequences of IAV infection on the biology of these cells, and their contribution to lung pathology in influenza. We will also discuss how virus-induced hyper-inflammatory responses present new entry-points for therapeutic intervention, showcasing Z-form nucleic acid-binding protein 1 (ZBP1)-initiated necroptosis as an example of one such pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe fungal disease caused by Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) that may spread hematogenously to extrapulmonary organs. IPA is typically associated with a broad spectrum of immunocompromised conditions and constitutes a high mortality rate. While the association of influenza as a risk for secondary bacterial infections is well appreciated, emerging evidence indicates that influenza-hospitalized patients demonstrate increased susceptibility to severe aspergillosis infection. In this study, we developed a murine Influenza A Virus (IAV)-Af co-infection model and investigated the role of IAV host response in promoting invasive Af infection. Our data show that IAV temporarily suppresses neutrophil recruitment in the early phase of Af co-infection (24 hours), followed by a subsequent increase in neutrophil levels (48 hours). RNA sequencing analysis of neutrophils from IAV-Af co-infected lungs (48 hours) reveals enrichment of pathways regulating inflammatory responses and phagocytosis. Despite higher inflammatory response and phagocytosis, the host response from IAV-Af co-infected lungs had suppressive effects on neutrophil conidial killing, correlating with lung fungal load and invasion. However, the increased fungal invasion observed at 24 hours post co-infection, despite similar fungal loads in both groups (Af vs. IAV-Af), suggests that IAV-induced pathologic lung inflammation and vascular damage likely promote Af invasiveness during the initial phase of co-infection, and subsequently, the defects in neutrophil fungicidal response and exacerbated lung damage lead to sustained and fatal IPA pathogenesis in the later phase of co-infection.">

BACKGROUND

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with an overactive immune response, contributing to disease severity. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays a central role in mediating inflammatory responses during viral infections, including COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES

This computational reanalysis explores the critical involvement of NF-κB signaling, particularly through toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and noncanonical pathways, in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, immune activation, and cytokine storm. We also discuss the crosstalk between NF-κB and other signaling pathways in the context of COVID-19, and summarize current and potential therapeutic strategies targeting NF-κB.

METHODS

An extensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, TLR signaling, NF-κB pathway activation, noncanonical NF-κB signaling, and anti-inflammatory drug interventions were analyzed and synthesized.

RESULTS

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, often facilitated by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease activity. This viral entry triggers downstream immune signaling cascades, especially through TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8. TLR engagement activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. NF-κB signaling exhibits extensive crosstalk with other pathways, including Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome (NLRP3) activation, contributing to cytokine storm and lung injury. Several pharmacological agents, including corticosteroids, Inhibitor of κB Kinase ( IKK) inhibitors, and repurposed drugs like dexamethasone and resveratrol, show potential in mitigating NF-κB-mediated inflammation.

CONCLUSION

NF-κB signaling serves as a pivotal mediator of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and immune dysregulation. Targeting this pathway—particularly its noncanonical branches and TLR-mediated activation—offers promising therapeutic avenues. Understanding NF-κB crosstalk with other immune pathways may yield synergistic drug targets to improve COVID-19 outcomes.">

        <tr id="Significance Understanding factors driving asymptomatic versus severe disease is of key importance if we are to control emerging and re-emerging viral infections. As preexisting CD8+ T-cell responses have been associated with asymptomatic COVID-19 in individuals expressing HLA-B*15:01, comparing to mild disease, we defined cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells responses directed at the HLA-B*15:01/S919 epitope in COVID-19 patients across disease outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to critical illness. We found that severe COVID-19 patients had an enrichment of an alternate T-cell receptor (TCR) motif compared to the key public motif expanded in milder patients. Our study provides evidence on differential nature of TCR clonal repertoire in 22.37% of HLA-B*15:01-positive COVID-19 patients who developed severe/critical disease in our cohorts, comparing to HLA-B*15:01-expressing individuals with mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Memory CD8+ T cells sense inflammation and rapidly produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ) independent of cognate antigens. This innate-like property, called bystander activation, is involved in early host defense before the antigen-specific memory response. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this activation remain unknown. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α (RORα) belongs to the nuclear receptor family and regulates gene transcription in ligand-dependent manner. Although RORα is highly expressed in memory CD8+ T cells, its functional relevance has not been investigated. Methods Primary and secondary memory T cells that are sufficient or deficient of RORα were induced by adoptive transfer of naïve OT-I T cells to recipient mice and subsequent infection with Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin (LM-OVA). RORα expression in memory T cells was examined by quantitative PCR. The target genes of RORα in memory T cells were explored by RNA-sequencing and verified by RORα overexpression in postactivated T cells. The impact of RORα-deficiency on bystander activation was assessed by stimulating memory T cells with inflammatory cytokines in vitro or injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into mice bearing memory T cells. Results RORα expression was remarkably elevated in secondary memory CD8+ T cells along with the enrichment of effector-like memory T cells. RORα primarily acted as a transcription factor in regulating the gene expression of the TL1A receptor. RORα deficiency abrogated the IFN-γ production by memory CD8+ T cells in response to IL-12 + TL1A in vitro and diminished the bystander response to LPS-induced inflammation in vivo. Conclusion This study revealed a regulatory mechanism of bystander activation. The findings also improve our understanding of how memory T cells increase their immediate protective capacity through repeated infections and vaccinations.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2, originally described as a respiratory pathogen, has been identified as a multisystem disease with complex and interconnected pathophysiological processes. Methods: The PRISMA framework was used to systematically review the evidence and identify and synthesize it in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases between January 2020 and May 2025. Of the 1410 screened records, 161 peer-reviewed studies involving more than 2 million patients were included in the analysis. The frequency of organ involvement, important biomarkers, and long-term outcomes were derived, and the quality of the studies was assessed using standardized tools. Results: The quantitative synthesis showed that 78%, 32%, 43%, and 28% of hospitalized patients had pulmonary, cardiovascular, 43% neurological, and 28% renal issues, respectively, with 10–35% showing persistent organ dysfunction at 6 months post-infection. The most common were cytokine storm (IL-6 (Interleukin-6) > 100 pg/mL in 72% of severe cases), endothelial dysfunction (biomarkers elevated in 87% of patients), and microvascular thrombosis (D-dimer > 2000 ng/mL in 46% of patients). Most domains were scored as having moderate-to-high confidence in the quality assessment. Conclusions: COVID-19 has long-term, multi-organ sequelae that require integrated multidisciplinary management. Healthcare systems should be ready to participate in long-term monitoring, rehabilitation, and special therapeutic development. The results offer a strong evidence base for clinical practice and post-pandemic health policy.">

        <tr id="Background The contribution of antibody-mediated responses to COVID - 19 outcomes remains unclear, particularly regarding cross-reactivity with unrelated pathogens. While co-infections are known to influence disease progression, the broader landscape of IgG reactivity during SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been systematically explored. Methods We employed a high-density peptide microarray containing 4,344 linear epitopes from 37 viruses, 27 bacteria, 17 parasites, and 8 fungi to characterize serum IgG repertoires from individuals with moderate (n = 39) or severe (n = 40) COVID - 19. Controls included pre-pandemic healthy donors and a pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) formulation. Data analysis included intensity ranking, epitope mapping, and comparative analysis of mean signal intensities for each epitope between the COVID-Mod and COVID-Sev groups. Results COVID - 19 patients showed widespread IgG reactivity against diverse pathogens, with patterns differing by disease severity. Severe cases displayed broader and more intense reactivity, notably against hepatitis C virus (HCV), SARS-CoV-1, influenza A, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Plasmodium falciparum. Moderate cases showed preferential recognition of epitopes from HTLV-I, Neisseria meningitidis, and Trypanosoma cruzi. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates pre-existing humoral memory, possibly through epitope spreading or immune reprogramming. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection reshapes the IgG epitope repertoire in a severity-dependent manner, extending to antigens from unrelated pathogens. This phenomenon may reflect underlying immune dysregulation or idiotype-driven interactions. Comprehensive profiling of pathogen-related IgG responses may reveal potential biomarkers of disease severity. This phenomenon may inform future investigations aimed at improving personalized management strategies for co-infected or immunocompromised patients.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in late 2019 as the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has triggered a global public health crisis. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is one of the key host factors mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and invasion. The inhibitors against TMPRSS2 emerge as a promising therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 and other potential viral infections. However, the precise mechanism of action for TMPRSS2 inhibitors remains unclear, with studies on structural optimization being notably scarce. In this work, multiple molecular simulation strategies were employed to systematically compare binding details and conformational changes of the representative inhibitors (i.e., camostat and nafamostat) with those of TMPRSS2 at the atomic level, thereby proposing potential inhibitory mechanisms underlying their activity differences. Compared with camostat, nafamostat is more likely to form a stable covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate. Next, a series of derivatives were designed with the same core structure (i.e., 4-guanidino benzoyl). And finally, the novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor with potentially better performance was identified based on the principle of the lowest binding free energy. This work not only elucidates the inhibitory mechanisms of camostat and nafamostat, showing valuable theoretical insights, but also proposes a viable strategy for future molecular design, thereby exhibiting promising application prospects.">

SARS-CoV-2 infection, a more recent cause of sepsis, shares similarities with non-SARS-CoV-2 sepsis but also exhibits distinct features. We have recently shown that plasma cholesteryl ester levels are higher in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection than in patients without, and this study analysed whether this may extend to differences in LPC, a bioactive constituent of lipoproteins. Methods: The plasma levels of 13 LPC species were measured by flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS) in 157 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis or septic shock. Of these patients, 24 had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Patients with SIRS exhibited higher plasma levels of the minor LPC species LPC 15:0 and 22:4 compared to those with sepsis or septic shock. Five LPC species were also reduced in the plasma of 31 patients with liver cirrhosis; therefore, patients with cirrhosis or SIRS were excluded from subsequent analyses. Compared to 76 non-COVID-19 patients with sepsis or septic shock, SARS-CoV-2 infection in 21 patients was associated with significantly higher plasma levels of ten individual LPC species and total LPC concentration. In patients with sepsis/septic shock, LPC species showed negative correlations with procalcitonin and interleukin-6, and positive correlations with gamma-glutamyltransferase and cholesteryl ester levels. In contrast, no significant associations were observed between LPC levels and C-reactive protein, aminotransferases, or free cholesterol. Conclusions: Differential LPC levels, despite comparable disease severity, may serve as metabolic biomarkers to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 sepsis from other causes of sepsis and inform targeted therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Understanding the durability of immunity induced by mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, especially in individuals with chronic health conditions, remains essential for guiding booster strategies. We conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses up to 21 months after a primary two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination followed by a booster, either homologous (BNT162b2) or heterologous (mRNA-1273). Methods: Twenty-eight adults, mostly with chronic conditions, were assessed at approximately 9, 12 and 21 months post-primary vaccination. Serum anti-trimeric Spike IgG levels were quantified, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed at 21 months for Spike-specific memory B-cell and T-cell responses by flow cytometry. Results: Participants were stratified by booster type, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and health status. Anti-Spike IgG persisted in all participants but declined over time. The heterologous mRNA-1273 booster induced higher antibody titers at 9 months, while the homologous BNT162b2 booster led to more sustained antibody levels and higher frequencies of Spike-specific memory B cells at 21 months. Prior infection significantly enhanced antibody titers, particularly in homologous booster recipients. Surprisingly, individuals with chronic health conditions exhibited equal or higher antibody levels compared to healthy participants at all time points. At 21 months, robust Spike-specific class-switched memory B cells and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that BNT162b2 vaccination elicits durable, multi-layered immunity lasting nearly two years, even in individuals with chronic conditions, and support the use of both homologous and heterologous mRNA boosters to sustain protection in diverse populations.">

The protein that mediates SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is highly expressed on the membrane of gastrointestinal (GI) cells. Consequently, infection can lead to direct damage to the GI tract and gut dysbiosis, which is associated with an imbalance of microbiota, inflammation, and other systemic infections and diseases. In this review, we will focus on the impact of COVID-19 on the GI system. We will examine the pathophysiology of gut dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients, as well as emphasize the significance of probiotics in addressing this condition. Additionally, we will identify key areas of interest that warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The multiple epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV) posed a substantial threat to public health. Clinical evidence suggests that ZIKV could break through the blood–brain, blood-placenta, and blood-testis barriers, leading to severe outcomes such as congenital malformations in newborns and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. Currently, there are no specific treatments for ZIKV infection. To address the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection induced by ZIKV vaccination, we designed two modified prM-E RNAs (ZA and ZB) with specific mutations either shielding or disrupting the conserved fusion-loop epitope in the E protein. Then, we chose the mRNA-LNP vaccine platform to evaluate the safety and efficacy. After prime-boost immunization, ZA vaccine could induce high levels of T cells secreting IFN-γ and exhibit limited neutralizing ability against Asian-lineage and African-lineage ZIKV. After ZIKV challenge, ZA vaccine could provide complete protection in immunocompromised AG129 mice at low levels of neutralizing antibodies, preventing viral dissemination to the brain, uterus, and testes. Importantly, the ZA vaccine also reduced the ADE effect of DENV infection. Although ZB vaccine exhibited good immunogenicity, it could not achieve complete viral clearance in AG29 mice. Our findings suggested that the ZA vaccine could prevent both lethal ZIKV infection and DENV ADE induced by infection or vaccination.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the critical need for broad-spectrum antivirals with high resistance barriers. Here, we demonstrate that SB431542, a selective TGF-β receptor I (ALK5) inhibitor, exhibits potent antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through unprecedented multitargeted mechanisms. Through comprehensive in vitro, isothermal titration calorimetry, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupts its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This interaction restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36–48 hours post-infection [hpi]), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-β-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release—processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 751.8 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favorable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-β/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-β-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection, collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for antiviral drugs with high barriers to resistance. This study reveals that SB431542, a drug previously developed to inhibit TGF-β signaling, exhibits remarkable effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 through an unprecedented triple-mechanism approach. Unlike conventional antivirals that target a single viral component, SB431542 simultaneously disrupts viral entry, assembly, and release by binding to the viral ORF3a protein and modulating host cellular processes. Most importantly, SARS-CoV-2 failed to develop resistance against SB431542 even after 50 generations of exposure—a significant advantage over current therapeutics that quickly lose effectiveness due to viral mutations. Our findings also uncover that coronaviruses exploit both lysosomal dysfunction and programmed cell death to spread efficiently, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. This research establishes SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor and demonstrates the value of targeting host-virus interactions to overcome antiviral resistance.">

        <tr id="Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, research has been ongoing to find the best diagnostic parameters to identify patients with a high risk of severe infection. Numerous studies have examined chemokine biomarkers in COVID-19 as a biomarker for high risk patients. The four main structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, spike protein, membrane protein, envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein enable the virus to penetrate host cells and stimulate the immune system. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via ACE2 in upper respiratory tract the virus entries by binding to the spike protein. Uncontrolled activation and enhancement of the immune response leads to massive release of cytokines and chemokines known as cytokine storm (CS). Chemokines are described as important cytokines in COVID-19 with a potential role as prognostic factor particularly for the severity of the infection and the risk of death from complications, to identify high-risk patients. Our review contains chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10), which level is significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 infection vs control individuals.">

        <tr id="Background: Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread intracellular protozoan that can cause chronic infection in immunocompetent hosts, leading to subclinical neuroinflammation. Understanding the immunopathogenesis of chronic cerebral toxoplasmosis requires well-characterized animal models. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate infection severity, affected immune cell populations, and cytokine response in both early and late chronic phases of T. gondii infection. Methods: A murine model was developed by infecting C57BL/6 mice with a sub-infective dose (104 tachyzoites) of the ME49 strain. Forty mice were used: 30 infected and 10 controls. Animals were sacrificed on days 30, 60, and 180 after infection. Brains were analyzed using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Histopathological changes, including gliosis, meningitis, vasculitis, and neuronal degeneration, were most prominent on days 30 and 60 and decreased by day 180. Immunohistochemistry revealed dynamic changes in immune cell populations (CD4+, CD8+, CD11b+, CD11c+, CD19+, and FOXP3+) and cytokine expression (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18). A mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory response was observed, shifting toward immunoregulation at day 180, with increased FOXP3+ cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines. PCR confirmed T. gondii DNA in all infected groups. Conclusion: This model shares several immunopathological features with chronic cerebral toxoplasmosis observed in immunocompetent humans, modeling aspects of the infection even in the absence of demonstrable tissue cysts. The immunological shift from pro-inflammatory to regulatory responses highlights the mechanisms of immune modulation and persistence. This study provides a useful platform to explore host-pathogen interactions and CNS immune dynamics in chronic cerebral toxoplasmosis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Women are disproportionately affected by neuropsychiatric symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19. However, whether there are central nervous system-specific changes in gene expression in women with neuropsychiatric Long COVID (NP-Long COVID) remains unknown.


METHODS
Twenty-two women with and ten women without NP-Long COVID were enrolled from New Haven, CT, and the surrounding region and consented to a blood draw and large volume lumbar puncture. Total RNA was extracted from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Polyadenylated RNA was sequenced, and differential expression analyses were performed.


RESULTS
Both CSF and PBMC samples showed differential gene expression associated with Long COVID status. There were CSF-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in people with Long COVID, including in genes related to oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, and P53 response, indicating compartment-specific immune responses. Some pathways were dysregulated in both the CSF and PBMC of Long COVID compared to controls, including those related to androgen response, MTORC1 signaling, and lipid metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
Women with NP-long COVID show compartment-specific, transcriptional profiles in the CSF with evidence of enrichment in cellular stress pathways. These results underscore the importance of examining CSF-specific molecular profiles to better understand post-viral neurological syndromes.">

        <tr id="Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality, with treatment resistance often driven by molecular heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate key oncogenic processes, but their comprehensive role in CRC progression and immune evasion remains unexplored. Methods We integrated multi-omics data from bulk RNA-seq (GEO/TCGA, n = 1,783), single-cell transcriptomics (41,143 cells), and Mendelian randomization. Differential expression, GSVA, and machine learning (LASSO/SVM/Random Forest) were used to identify PTM-associated signatures. Functional validation included spatial transcriptomics, and immune profiling. Results Multi-omics analysis identified dysregulation in 80% of PTM pathways in CRC, with ubiquitination sustaining Wnt/β-catenin signaling and GALNT6-mediated glycosylation driving immune evasion through PD-L1 stabilization and CD8 + T cell exclusion. Single-cell analysis revealed GALNT6-specific enrichment in immune-excluded goblet cells (p < 0.05). Machine learning derived a 5-gene PTM Activity Signature (CCNB1IP1, GALNT6, NEDD4L, PSMD14, UBE2C) that distinguish between patients with diseases and those without (AUC = 1.00). GALNT6 was validated as a causal risk factor (OR = 1.10, 95%CI:1.01–1.18), with its inhibition synergizing with anti-PD-1 to enhance CD8 + T cell infiltration (p < 0.01). Conclusion This study establishes PTM networks as central regulators of CRC progression and immune resistance. The PTM-AS framework enables precision subtyping, while GALNT6 emerges as a novel therapeutic target for overcoming immunotherapy resistance.

        <tr id="The circulatory and immune systems function in close coordination to maintain homeostasis and act as a frontline defense against infections. However, under certain conditions, this interaction becomes dysregulated, leading to thromboinflammation, a pathological process marked by the concurrent and excessive activation of coagulation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. During viral infections, this phenomenon can markedly worsen clinical outcomes. Evidence indicates that viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, influenza, and SARS-CoV can trigger thromboinflammatory responses involving platelet activation, the release of procoagulant and pro-inflammatory mediators, and the formation of thrombi within blood vessels. While this response may initially help contain viral dissemination, in cases of high viremia it can progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemorrhage, and multiple organ failure. This review compiles current evidence on thromboinflammatory mechanisms induced by arboviral and respiratory viruses and examines how these processes contribute to diseases’ pathogenesis and clinical severity.">

        <tr id="Although most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases resolve within a few weeks after the onset of infection, a considerable number of patients still suffer from prolonged or recurrent symptoms evident after weeks or months post-COVID-19 recovery. This paper analyzed the current literature related to long-term manifestations of COVID-19 and aimed to identify the common symptoms reported four weeks or more after the initial onset of the disease. COVID-19 has been shown to have lasting systemic effects on an array of organ systems, such as the lungs, heart, brain, and gastrointestinal systems. Common symptoms include, but are not limited to, fatigue, brain fog, respiratory difficulties, and loss of taste and smell. The impact of COVID-19 on multiple organ systems is thought to be associated with its ability to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors throughout the body and promote cytokine release. This study provides insight into common long-term manifestations of COVID-19. Future studies should look at how long COVID-19 syndrome affects various subpopulations differently.">

        <tr id="The continuous evolution of coronaviruses poses persistent and severe threats to both human and animal health. While α- and β-coronaviruses mainly infect mammals, including humans, γ-coronaviruses predominantly infect poultry, causing substantial economic losses. Their rapid mutation rates and wide host tropism underscore the urgent demand for pan-coronavirus therapeutics. Here, we systematically investigated the antiviral potency and mechanism of action of PB28, a selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist, across α-, β-, and γ-coronaviruses. Molecular docking predicted a stable interaction between PB28 and the sigma-1 receptor. PB28 exhibits robust in vitro antiviral activity, effectively inhibiting the replication of β-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 and its Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants; HCoV-OC43), α-coronaviruses (PEDV and TGEV), and γ-coronaviruses (IBV). Broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy is further validated by viral titration assays. In vivo, PB28 administration in K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 Delta and BALB/c mice infected with HCoV-OC43 led to significantly reduced viral loads, attenuated multi-organ pathology, and improved survival and body weight maintenance. In parallel, PB28 treatment in IBV-infected chicken embryos and neonatal chicks enhanced survival, supported embryogenesis, and alleviated tissue damage. Collectively, PB28 demonstrates cross-genus antiviral efficacy, likely mediated through modulation of the sigma-1 receptor. These findings highlight PB28 as a promising lead compound for the development of pan-coronavirus therapeutics.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, cause severe infections of the respiratory system. Cohort studies and clinical observations indicate that patients with severe influenza A virus (IAV) infections are at an increased risk of developing an ischemic stroke event. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To this end, we investigated the consequences of IAV infection on cerebral damage in a mouse model of ischemic stroke.


METHODS
We intranasally inoculated male C57BL6/N mice with the mouse-adapted IAV strain A/Puerto Rico 8/34 or PBS as a vehicle control. At 3, 7, and 10 days post-infection, mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by sacrifice 24 hours after reperfusion for subsequent analysis. The anticoagulant drug acetylsalicylic acid was administered as treatment 1 day before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.


RESULTS
Our research demonstrated a time-dependent deterioration of cerebral ischemia after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, resulting in increased infarct volume and a worsened neurological outcome at the propagation and inflammation phases of infection. Our observations revealed an elevation in procoagulant activity and an increase in thrombosis within the microvasculature after infection and stroke. This effect was attributed to an infection-mediated inflammatory milieu and accelerated neutrophil response. Upon infection, the release of increased neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils had detrimental consequences for transient middle cerebral artery occlusion development. Administration of acetylsalicylic acid or control antiviral therapy prevented the IAV-induced exacerbation of stroke and reduced brain damage by reducing NETosis and coagulation.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that IAV infections enhance the systemic propensity for NETosis and foster a procoagulant state, thereby increasing the risk of cerebral damage and thrombosis following stroke. Targeting a combination of neutrophils and coagulation molecules simultaneously represents a promising treatment approach for clinical stroke.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant global impact on the respiratory system and multiple organ systems, including the nervous system. Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection and its vaccines have been increasingly recognised, ranging from problems with smell and taste to more severe conditions such as encephalitis, stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. This narrative review critically evaluates the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 infection and its vaccines, providing insights into potential pathophysiological mechanisms. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, and data were retrieved from various databases. The prevalence, types, and severity of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients were discussed. The possible mechanisms of neurological injury in COVID-19 were explored, including direct viral invasion, hypoxic brain injury, immune-mediated damage, and cerebrovascular injury. Furthermore, the review addressed the neurological complications associated with COVID-19 vaccination. While severe vaccine-related adverse effects remain rare, understanding their occurrence is essential for risk assessment and public health interventions. In conclusion, COVID-19 can affect the nervous system in various ways, leading to various neurological symptoms. Further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of these manifestations and develop effective preventive and treatment strategies to manage this global health crisis.">

        <tr id="Abstract The obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii is estimated to infect a third of the world’s population. Toxoplasmosis is considered a significant worldwide disease that can lead to morbidity or death in immunocompromised individuals. Host defense against T. gondii has been demonstrated to be dependent on a rapid myeloid cell and lymphocyte response working in concert to quickly eliminate the invading pathogen. Classically, T-bet–dependent group 1 innate lymphocytes (ILC1s), natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+ T cell–derived interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are considered indispensable for host resistance against T. gondii. However, recent discoveries have illustrated that T-bet is not required for NK cell– or CD4+ T cell–derived IFN-γ. Yet, lack of T-bet still results in rapid mortality, pointing to a T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–mediated host defense pathway. This review summarizes the myeloid cell–mediated immune response against T. gondii and provides insights into the lesser known components of the T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–dependent host defense pathway for pathogen clearance.">

        <tr id="Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways influenced by a complex network of cytokines and chemokines, among which CXC chemokine ligand 3 (CXCL3) plays an important role and has been linked to airway remodeling and disease severity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, induces systemic immune dysregulation with elevated inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and D-dimer. The interaction between CXCL3-mediated airway inflammation and systemic inflammatory responses in asthmatic patients during COVID-19 infection remains insufficiently elucidated, with limited data clarifying its contribution to disease severity and outcomes. Objective: To evaluate the correlation of serum CXCL3 and classical inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) with asthma severity among patients with and without COVID-19 infection and to determine their relationship with lung function (FEV₁) and predictors of severe asthma. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 asthmatic patients, stratified according to COVID-19 infection status (76 positive, 124 negative). Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were analyzed. Serum levels of CXCL3 and inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer) were compared between groups and correlated with asthma severity and FEV₁. Results: COVID-19-positive asthmatics exhibited significantly higher levels of CXCL3 (241.5 ± 83.7 vs. 173.8 ± 76.4 ng/mL, p<0.001) and inflammatory markers, along with lower FEV₁ (54.3 ± 17.2 vs. 62.1 ± 18.9; p=0.003) compared to COVID-19-negative patients. CXCL3, CRP, and D-dimer levels increased progressively with asthma severity (p<0.001), furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between CXCL3 and asthma severity (r = 0.62) as well as between CXCL3 and CRP (r = 0.41). Logistic regression revealed FEV₁ <60% as an independent predictor of severe asthma (OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.78–5.47, p<0.001), whereas COVID-19 infection showed an inverse association with severe asthma (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25–0.91, p=0.026). Conclusion: Serum CXCL3 and systemic inflammatory markers are significantly associated with asthma severity and lung function impairment, particularly in the presence of COVID-19 infection. CXCL3 may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing asthma severity and guiding clinical management in patients with concurrent COVID-19.

        <tr id="Whole blood (WB) transcriptomics offers a minimal-invasive method to assess patients’ immune system. This study aimed to identify transcriptional patterns in WB associated with clinical outcomes in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We performed RNA-sequencing on pre-treatment WB samples from 145 patients with advanced cancer. Additionally, we compiled a separate dataset of 14,085 WB transcriptomes from diverse health backgrounds from public repositories and applied consensus-independent component analysis (c-ICA) to identify transcriptional components (TCs). The biological processes represented by these TCs were elucidated using gene set enrichment analysis. The activity of the TCs was then quantified in the 145 WB profiles and analyzed for associations with tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival using univariate and multivariate analyses in a permutation framework. RNA-sequencing variant calling was performed, and the activity of the TCs was assessed in specific cell lineages using a single-cell immune cell atlas of the human hematopoietic system. c-ICA on 14,085 WB transcriptomes identified 1262 distinct TCs representing various cellular processes. Of these, 18 TCs were associated with ≥ 1 outcome parameter, with three specifically linked to tumor response. Top genes in these three TCs included CCHCR1, TCF19, LTA, DDX39B, and PPP1R18. RNA-sequencing variant calling and single-cell transcriptome projections revealed associations between these four TCs and germline variants. These findings support the potential of the identified WB-based transcriptional patterns to complement tumor characteristics in predictive and prognostic models for improved patient stratification.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in global morbidity and high mortality rates worldwide. According to case histories, for a long time after acute COVID-19 infection (six months to 2-3 years), patients may experience a pronounced fatigue, increased tiredness, higher incidence of acute respiratory viral infections per year, increased recurrence of skin diseases, allergies, exacerbation of pulmonary disorders, urinary tract diseases, increased recurrence of chronic viral diseases, e.g., herpesvirus and papillomavirus infections, aggravation of chronic cardiovascular and other somatic diseases of various organs and systems. Patients were examined at early as six months after recovery from acute COVID-19. Such persistent post-infectious consequences are referred to as post-COVID syndrome. When assessing post-COVID syndrome, it is necessary to identify the main clinical syndromes of multiorgan pathology characteristic of post-COVID patients. Endocrine and cardiac manifestations of post-COVID syndrome may be a consequence of direct damage from viral infection, immunological and inflammatory damage, as well as iatrogenic complications. Objective of our study was to assess the impact of acute COVID-19 severity on the course of post-COVID syndrome. The research objectives were as follows: 1. To analyze the severity of clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disorders in post-COVID patients depending on the degree of lung damage in the acute period of COVID-19 (CT0 to CT4). 2. To analyze the severity of clinical manifestations of endocrine disorders, including newly diagnosed pathology, in post-COVID patients depending on the degree of lung damage in acute period of COVID-19. Since we did not found any significant gender-and age-dependent differences, all patients were divided into groups by the degree of lung damage during acute period of COVID-19, according to clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection. This study showed that the clinical picture of post-COVID syndrome is characterized by a pronounced diversity in development of multiple organ pathology, both newly diagnosed, or manifesting by increased frequency of exacerbations of chronic diseases. Conclusions: 1. According to the data obtained, reliable differences were obtained between groups CT0 and CT1-2, as well as CT0 and CT3-4: the frequency of exacerbating cardiovascular disorders in the post-COVID period is significantly higher in groups with lung damage over acute period of COVID-19 compared to the group of patients without lung damage. These data suggest that cardiovascular disorders are directly related to the severity of COVID-19, viral load, and were detected most frequently (68%) in post-COVID patients who initially had a severe coronavirus infection. 2. According to our results, the frequency of glucose metabolism disorders, including those detected for the first time, proved to be significantly increased in the post-COVID patients with lung damage during acute infection. Meanwhile, no significant differences were found for thyroid disorders, except of autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). These disorders may be associated with usage of corticosteroid therapy in acute period of coronavirus infection, or with impairment of regulatory mechanisms of the endocrine and immune systems induced by SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus again confirming our assumptions concerning development of multiple organ pathology in post-COVID patients.">

At one month of age, offspring of vaccinated dams—but not controls—showed enhanced working memory, increased neural proliferation, neuroblast formation, stem cell activity, and more mature neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG). Luminex assay showed elevated hippocampal IFN-γ and CX3CL1, both linked to neurogenesis and memory. Conditional knockout experiments identified microglial IFNγR1 and CX3CR1 as key mediators of neuronal development through regulating microglial activation and chemotaxis.

After a decade of declining mortality rates from cancer in the US, from 2020, registered age-standardized cancer-related deaths and mortality increased for all cancers. Cancer cell ‘dormancy’ results from an equilibrium between tumor cell division and apoptosis, and provides an explanation for relapse and metastasis that can occur months, years, or decades after treatment. In July 2025, findings from a study in mice infected with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 showed the rapid loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast carcinoma cells in the lung, and expansion of metastatic carcinoma cells within weeks. Animal model findings support findings in cancer survivors that SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung metastasis and cancer-related mortality. This Editorial aims to highlight findings from real-world population studies on the association between COVID-19 and cancer and new experimental findings for how SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and possibly other respiratory viruses may ‘awaken’ dormant cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Introduction HIV-1 subtype A and subtype C infections have different rates of clinical disease progression, with subtype C infected individuals in the IAVI Protocol C multisite acute infection cohort having a 60% faster CD4 loss compared to subtype A. Methods In order to investigate whether differences were due to the phenotype of the transmitted founder virus (TFV), or inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, known to drive pathogenesis, we PCR amplified, sequenced and constructed infectious molecular HIV-1 clones from the plasma of 30 acutely infected individuals in Rwanda and Zambia. We next compared the inflammatory plasma cytokine/chemokine profiles of individuals pre- and post-the estimated date of infection of 20 Rwandan individuals infected with subtype A and 34 Zambians infected with subtype C HIV-1. Results A comparison of the replicative capacity of 14 subtype A and 16 subtype C TFV showed that they had similar replicative capacity (RC) scores. Nevertheless, high TFV RC scores were linked to more rapid CD4+ T cell loss, and higher inflammatory cytokine levels irrespective of subtype. Multivariable analyses showed that individuals infected with subtype C exhibited a significant increase in the levels of eleven pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines after infection, while, in subtype A infections only six cytokines were significantly elevated postinfection. Despite these differences, at 3-months post infection, similar overall biomarker profiles were observed in individuals infected with subtype A or subtype C viruses, primarily due to higher pre-infection baseline biomarker levels in Rwanda. In the combined cohort, we found a highly significant association between faster CD4+ T cell decline and higher levels of ITAC (CXCL11), which in turn was linked to higher TFV RC. Discussion Overall, the data presented here argue against TFV RC as the basis for different pathogenic outcomes in the subtypes A and C. Moreover, levels of inflammatory cytokines that might drive disease progression were similar during acute infection indicating that additional studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying differences in disease progression between the two subtypes. For both subtypes, high levels of ITAC during acute HIV-1 infection are linked to rapid disease progression.">

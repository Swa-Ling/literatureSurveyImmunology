        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Development of therapeutic approaches that target specific microglia responses in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is crucial due to the involvement of microglia in ALS progression. Our study identifies the predominant microglia subset in human ALS primary motor cortex and spinal cord as an undifferentiated phenotype with dysregulated respiratory electron transport. Moreover, we find that the interferon response microglia subset is enriched in donors with aggressive disease progression, while a previously described potentially protective microglia phenotype is depleted in ALS. Additionally, we observe an enrichment of non-microglial immune cell, mainly NK/T cells, in the ALS central nervous system, primarily in the spinal cord. These findings pave the way for the development of microglia subset-specific therapeutic interventions to slow or even stop ALS progression.

        <tr id="Introduction During gestation the immune system undergoes dramatic remodelling to protect the maternal-fetal dyad from infections whilst also preventing fetal rejection. We investigated how SARS-CoV-2 modifies the immune landscape during infection and in recovered pregnant women. Methods We immunophenotyped our two independent geographical cohorts using a 14-colour flow cytometry panel (surface and intracellular staining). We estimated cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in validation cohort using a multiplexd flow cytometry panel. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed using a Chromium Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead Chip and Library Kit from 10x Genomics (Drop-seq method). Furthermore, we estimated the cytotoxic functions of natural killer (NK) cells by flow cytometry using surface and intracellular staining. Results Using two independent geographical cohorts, we identified that NK cells had a sustained reduction during active infection and after recovery. Further, scRNA-seq data revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 rewired the gene expression profile of NK, monocytes, CD4+, CD8+ effector T cells and antibody producing B cells in convalescent pregnant women. Several gene pathways associated with cytotoxic function, interferon signalling type I & II, and pro- and anti-inflammatory functions in NK and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were attenuated in recovered pregnant patients compared with healthy pregnancies. We validated our scRNA-seq of NK cells from convalescent pregnant women and confirmed that NK cells had diminished levels of cytotoxic proteins; perforin, CD122 and granzyme B. Discussion Overall, our study uncovers that SARS-CoV-2 infection deranges the adaptive immune response in pregnant women even after recovery and may contribute to post-COVID19 sequalae of symptoms.">

        <tr id="Aging significantly influences host immune responses to viral infections, including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Despite its high fatality rate and pandemic potential, effective therapies remain unavailable, and the age-dependent mechanisms underlying SFTSV pathogenesis are not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed a ferret model (an immunocompetent animal model that mimics human SFTSV infections) and performed multi-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing and histopathological analyses. Our results reveal that, upon SFTSV infection, aged ferrets experience extensive decrease of critical immune cells (particularly B and T cells) due to infection-induced cell death and excessive hemophagocytosis in hematopoietic organs, whereas young-adult ferrets rapidly clear the virus with minimal lymphocyte changes. Notably, aged ferrets display marked immune dysregulation, characterized by non-specific activation of T-bet ⁺ age-associated memory B cells (T-bet+ ABCs) and the proliferation of defective plasmablasts (MKI67 ⁺ PB1), which serve as major viral reservoirs and drive systemic viral dissemination. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that the MKI67 ⁺ PB1 subset dominates SFTSV⁺ cells in both aged ferrets and human fatal cases, exhibiting the highest per-cell viral UMI counts. Moreover, monocytes and macrophages in aged ferrets exhibit heightened inflammatory gene expression, contributing to the hyper-inflammatory state observed during infection. Collectively, these insights underscore the critical role of dysregulated memory B cell responses and hyper-inflammation in age-dependent SFTSV pathogenesis, highlighting potential targets for interventions in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="The evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its impact on public health continue to demand attention as the virus continues to evolve, demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt to diverse selective pressures including immune responses, therapeutic treatments, and prophylactic interventions. The SARS-CoV-2 variant landscape remains dynamic, with new subvariants continuously emerging, many harboring spike protein mutations linked to immune evasion. In this study, we characterized a panel of live SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those key subvariants implicated in recent waves of infection. Our findings revealed a significant variability in mutation patterns in the spike protein across the strains analyzed. Commercial antibodies and human convalescent plasma (HCoP) samples from unvaccinated donors were ineffective in neutralizing the most recent Omicron subvariants, particularly after the emergence of JN.1 subvariant. Using human airway epithelial cells derived from healthy bronchiolar tissue (hBAEC), we established both monoinfections and coinfections involving SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus H1N1 (IFAV_H1N1) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Assessments were conducted to compare viral infectivity and the production and release of immune mediators in the apical and basolateral compartments. Notably, Omicron KP.3.1.1 subvariant induced a more pronounced cytopathic effect in hBAEC compared to its parental strain JN.1 and even surpassed the impact observed with the ancestral wild-type virus (WA1/2020, Washington strain). Furthermore, the coinfection of KP.3.1.1 subvariant with IFAV_H1N1 or RSV did not attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity; instead, it significantly exacerbated the pathogenic synergy in the lung epithelium. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-β, and IL-10 were upregulated in hBAEC following SARS-CoV-2 monoinfection with recent Omicron subvariants as well as during coinfection with IFAV_H1N1 and RSV. Taken together, our findings offer new insights into the immune evasion strategies and pathogenic potential of evolving SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, as well as their interactions with other respiratory viruses, carrying important implications for therapeutic development and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The Long COVID syndrome is a major global health problem, affecting approximately 10–20% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus with many remaining symptomatic beyond one year. Fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance and hyperlactataemia on minimal exertion have led to the suggestion of a bioenergetic defect. We hypothesised that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathological feature in Long COVID cases and would correlate with clinical outcome. Methods This prospective, case-controlled, observational study recruited 27 participants with an established diagnosis of Long COVID syndrome from a single tertiary clinic together with 16 age-matched controls aged 25–65 years. Seahorse-based mitochondrial flux analysis and bioenergetics profile of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed and correlated with clinical phenotype. Findings Long COVID cases had an increased baseline and ATP-induced oxygen consumption rate with a significant attenuation in tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate fluorescence response to oligomycin. Correlations were observed between mitochondrial function and autonomic health, quality of life and time from index infection. Sex-specific differences were also observed. Interpretation PBMCs from Long COVID subjects exhibit an exceptional and distinctive change in ATP synthase, as it contributes to the mitochondrial membrane potential rather than using it exclusively to generate ATP. The findings suggest that the enzyme runs both forward and reverse reactions, synthesising and hydrolysing ATP. The correlation of mitochondrial function with clinical phenotype in Long COVID may indicate a causal relationship and warrants further validation in larger scale studies.">

While humanized major histocompatibility complex (hMHC) murine models have been extensively utilized in oncological research, their application in virological studies-particularly for coronavirus pathogenesis-remains underexplored. Methods This study systematically characterized immune responses in SARS-CoV-2-challenged hMHC mice lung tissues through comparative transcriptomic profiling, combined with functional enrichment and PPI network analyses. Results Key findings demonstrate that hMHC mice exhibit enhanced immunological activation relative to wild-type controls, particularly in IFN-γ signaling pathways and neutrophil mobilization dynamics that closely parallel human post-vaccination responses. Comparative analysis with human whole blood RNA-seq datasets revealed that hMHC mice exhibit both high reproducibility in transcriptomic profiles and significant similarity to human immune responses across innate and adaptive immunity. Conclusions These results confirm that the hMHC murine model can serve as an effective platform for vaccine research, providing a theoretical foundation for the application of humanized MHC mice and offering new insights into viral infection mechanisms and the development of novel vaccines.">

However, accumulating evidence has begun to highlight the plasticity of transcriptional states of neutrophils during pathological insults. Whether such unconventional neutrophils may share commonality across diverse disease conditions is incompletely understood. Here, we systematically profile over 500,000 neutrophils in key immune compartments and disease-inflicted tissues of the mouse models of metabolic disorder, autoimmunity, tissue damage, peripheral cancers, and intracranial gliomas. Of importance, we observe two distinct neutrophil clusters with unique immune features. The first cluster, characterized by Cd274, Vegfa, and antigen presentation, is highly enriched within the diseased tissues. In contrast, the second cluster with elevated Cd244 and type 2 immune response but reduced maturation markers primarily emerges in the peripheral blood and spleens of specific disease scenarios. These results have elucidated the common signatures of neutrophils in response to various pathological conditions, providing a valuable reference for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.">

We profiled circulating immune cells from healthy older adults (median age: 73) who were CMV(+) or CMV(-) using single-cell RNA-sequencing and validated key findings by flow cytometry. CMV(+) individuals exhibited significant expansion of adaptive immune cells: CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ TEMRA T, GZMK+ CD8⁺ T, γδ T, and atypical B cells. Among innate immune cells, monocytes and dendritic cells remained largely unchanged while KLRC2+ (adaptive) NK cells increased and CD56dim NK cells decreased. To facilitate CMV assessment in datasets with unknown CM serostatus, we developed CMVerify, a machine learning classifier that accurately predicts CMV serostatus from single-cell data across platforms and age groups (97% accuracy). These findings reveal extensive CMV-associated immune remodeling in older adults and underscore the importance of incorporating CMV status in studies of immune aging.">

        <tr id="Identification of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection typically relies on serology, yet T-cells play a key role in the adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated in parallel the SARS-CoV-2-specific as well as endemic human coronavirus-specific humoral and cross-reactive cellular responses in children and adults. We analyzed clinical data and blood samples from a family cohort of 96 children and 144 adults at 3–4 and 11–12 months after their first contact with SARS-CoV-2. Humoral response was assessed by a multiplex immunoassay with high sensitivity and specificity (MULTICOV-AB). Cellular responses were analyzed by IFN-γ ELISPOT using four different established epitope compositions (ECs) to discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 specific and HCoV cross-reactive T-cell responses. While the majority of adults had a combined serological and T-cell response, relatively more children had a T-cell response alone rather than a combined response. The magnitude of the T-cell response correlated with symptoms and the humoral response. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly boosted the endemic coronavirus-specific cellular response. Overall, our data suggest discordant humoral and cellular responses, reflecting either abortive infection, cellular sensitization with rapid viral clearance or rapid antibody waning or a combination of these phenomena. Restricting epidemiologic analysis to SARS-CoV-2 serological data may underestimate rates of infection with or at least exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in children.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astrocytes provide physical and metabolic support for neurons, regulate the blood–brain barrier, and react to injury, infection, and disease. When astrocytes become reactive, maintenance of the inflammatory state and its functional implications throughout chronic neuroinflammation are all poorly understood. Several models of acute inflammation have revealed astrocyte subpopulations that go beyond a two‐activation state model, instead encompassing distinct functional subsets. However, how reactive astrocyte (RA) subsets evolve over time during chronic inflammatory disease or infection has been difficult to address. Here we use a prolific human pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, that causes lifelong infection in the brain alongside a Lcn2CreERT2 reporter mouse line to examine reactive astrocyte subsets during chronic neuroinflammation. Single‐cell RNA sequencing revealed diverse astrocyte populations including transcriptionally unique Lcn2CreERT2+ RAs which change over the course of infection in a subset‐dependent manner. In addition to an immune‐regulating Lcn2CreERT2+ astrocyte population enriched with gene transcripts encoding chemokines CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and receptors CCR7 and IL7R, a specific subset of Lcn2CreERT2+ astrocytes highly expressed transthyretin (Ttr), a secreted carrier protein involved in glycolytic enzyme activation and potential vasculature regulation and angiogenesis. These findings provide novel information about the evolution and diversity of reactive astrocyte subtypes and functional signatures at different stages of infection, revealing an undocumented role for transthyretin‐expressing astrocytes in immune regulation at the central nervous system (CNS) vasculature.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to global consequences since its emergence in late 2019, impacting health, economies, and societies worldwide. Understanding the early responses following infection will provide crucial insights into the immune mechanisms governing disease progression and protection. We employed the single-cell RNA-sequencing approach using bronchoalveolar lavage cells of rhesus macaques at 0-3 days post-infection (dpi) in a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2. Our results show the increased abundance of two subsets of macrophages that express IFN-responsive gene signatures, inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid DCs, and conventional DCs at 3 dpi, coinciding with peak viremia. Moreover, our investigation underscores the enrichment of IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, and IL-1 signaling pathways within myeloid populations at 2-3 dpi in comparison to baseline. These findings substantially deepen our comprehension, elucidating the transcriptional landscape at the single-cell level during the early phases of COVID-19 within a highly relevant model.


IMPORTANCE
Understanding the immune response in the early stages of COVID-19 is crucial for developing better treatments and vaccines. In this study, we used advanced single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques, a model for human SARS-CoV-2 infection, within the first few days after infection. We identify key immune cell types, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that are activated early on and produce important signals to fight the virus. These findings help clarify how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 at the single-cell level, offering valuable insights that could guide future therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a heterogeneous infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The distinctive features of COVID-19 infection encompass a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe illness involving diverse underlying pathophysiological processes such as hyperinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic microangiopathies, and multiple organ failure. However, the host responses to COVID-19, including systemic inflammation and immunity against SARS-CoV-2, remain largely undefined across different disease states. Here, we performed global transcriptome profiling of 228 peripheral blood samples of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations and subsequent clustering using an unsupervised algorithm. We identified various transcriptomic clusters and globally dysregulated immune-related pathways, leading to distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles in severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This underscores the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release. Additionally, our results reveal variances in circulating cell populations and the activation of apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients with diverse clinical presentations offers valuable insights into molecular mechanisms and may inform clinical decisions on anti-inflammatory therapies.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is primarily known as a respiratory disease. The continued study of the disease has shown that long-term COVID-19 symptoms include persisting effects of the virus on the brain when the infection is over, possibly even leading to neurodegeneration. However, the exact mechanisms of nervous system damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear. In this study, we focused on two possibly shared pathways of SARS-CoV-2-induced neural dysfunction and neurodegeneration: protein aggregation, which is associated with impaired protein clearance, and inflammatory responses, which involve a hyper-active immune status. We observed distinct expression and distribution patterns of ten SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the two cell lines, meanwhile forming aggregation puncta and inducing pro-inflammatory responses. We found that the ER stress was induced and that the autophagy-lysosome pathway was inhibited upon viral protein expression. Boosting autophagy function attenuated protein aggregation, suggesting that modulation of autophagy might be a valid strategy for inhibiting cytotoxic effects of SARS-CoV- 2 proteins. Our study provides potential explanations of SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damage, based on shared cellular mechanisms and furthermore, suggests that modulation of proteostasis may serve as therapeutic strategies for preventing long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 cytotoxic effects.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe and often fatal complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Although much progress has been made in understanding CM, the precise pathogenesis remains elusive. The olfactory bulb (OB) has emerged as a critical site of immunopathology in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) models, but its contribution to disease progression is not fully understood. To investigate the molecular mechanisms driving early ECM pathogenesis, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of the OB to identify key genes associated with disease onset. Our analysis revealed significant early upregulation of interferon (IFN)-inducible GTPases, particularly Irgb6 and Gbp4, effectors downstream of IFN-γ but not IFN-α/β signaling, suggesting their involvement in ECM pathology. Using Gbp4−/−, Irgb6−/−, and double knockout (Irgb6−/− Gbp4−/−) mice, we identified a pathological role for these GTPases. Mechanistically, we found that double-knockout mice exhibited increased infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the brain but with reduced T cell functionality and impaired antigen presentation by endothelial cells, leading to enhanced parasite accumulation in the OB. This disruption in immune regulation ultimately conferred improved survival in the Irgb6−/− Gbp4−/− mice and indicated the pathological impact of Gbp4 and Irgb6 in ECM. These findings reveal that Gbp4 and Irgb6 play important roles in the early immunopathogenesis of ECM by modulating antigen processing and presentation in the OB, thereby shaping immune cell dynamics. Our work shows the dual role of Irgb6 and Gbp4 GTPases in host defence and immunopathology and offers new insights into ECM mechanisms and antigen presentation. IMPORTANCE Cerebral malaria (CM) arises from an excessive inflammatory response and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) dysfunction in Plasmodium-infected hosts, but the precise mechanisms driving early-stage pathogenesis remain unclear. Through RNA sequencing of the olfactory bulb (OB) in a murine experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) model, we identified the early upregulation of interferon (IFN)-inducible GTPases, Irgb6 and Gbp4, key effectors downstream of IFN-γ signaling. Our results demonstrate that Gbp4 and Irgb6 synergistically contribute to ECM pathology by regulating antigen cross-presentation in endothelial cells. This dysregulation leads to abnormal parasite burden and alters the accumulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the brain via the OB, further perturbing inflammation. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism in CM and emphasize the pivotal roles of Gbp4 and Irgb6 in promoting cell-autonomous immune responses that, in turn, escalate pathological inflammation. Our study offers insights into how dysregulated immune responses drive CM progression and suggests potential therapeutic targets to mitigate fatal outcomes.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the worst pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Studies have shown that severe COVID-19 patients have immune dysfunction. To characterize the dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and scV(D)J-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from mild, moderate, and severe patients. We observed that as the severity of the disease increased, several CD8 + T cell subsets and Treg cells continued to decrease, while CD4 + T subsets, natural killer cells and plasma cells continued to increase. Several aberrantly expressed biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity were identified. For example, RPS26 was down-regulated, while the ZFP36, IL-32, and IgM genes were up-regulated with increasing disease severity. Functional analysis showed multiple immune-related pathways, such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-10 production pathways, were dysregulated. As the disease severity increased, intercellular interactions fluctuated. Particularly, naive CD8 + T cells regulated memory and activated CD8 + T cells, and the weakening in Treg cells’ regulation of other immune cells was especially obvious. The expression of the MIF signaling pathway, mediated by CD74 + CXCR4, was higher throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection and the intensity of immune cell-cell interactions mediated by TGF-β was enhanced from mild to severe. Subsequently, scV(D)J-seq analysis showed a decreasing trend in the number of clonotypes, repertoire diversity and clonotypes overlap of monoclonal B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) as the SARS-CoV-2 progresses. The CDR3 sequence length in COVID-19-specific clonotypes showed a bias towards being longer as the severity of COVID-19 increases. Our findings may provide new clues for understanding COVID-19 immunopathogenesis and help identify optimal biomarkers for new therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a complex cascade of cellular and molecular responses, yet the complex cellular communication remains incompletely understood. This study explored how intercellular communication contributes to the activation of microglia and astrocytes after SCI. Here, we integrated four datasets using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and constructed a comprehensive cellular atlas of the injured spinal cord. Transcriptomic changes in microglia and astrocytes were analyzed. We identified CD44 as a key receptor in SPP1-mediated microglial activation, which represented a subpopulation involved in inflammatory response in microglia. We defined a gliogenesis subpopulation of astrocytes that emerged at 3 dpi, which became the predominant cell type in the injured spinal cord. These astrocytes highly expressed the Nucleolin (Ncl) gene and interacted via the Pleiotrophin (Ptn) signaling pathway, which is associated with astrocyte proliferation. To validate these findings, we utilized a crush injury model. Flow cytometry of isolated microglia and astrocytes confirmed the upregulation of CD44 in microglia and NCL in astrocytes in response to SCI. In vivo results confirmed that the CD44 positive microglia accumulated and PLA results further confirmed the combination of SPP1 with CD44. In parallel, the upregulated expression of NCL in astrocytes facilitated their proliferation, underscoring the role of the NCL receptor in gliogenesis after SCI. In vitro validation demonstrated that exogenous SPP1 upregulates CD44 expression by promoting the phosphorylation of p65 and activating the NF-κB pathways in BV2 microglia, and that high expression of IL-6 indicates the activation of inflammation. PTN may enhance NCL expression and thus facilitates astrocyte proliferation. Collectively, our study identified key receptors that regulated inflammation responses and gliogenesis. Targeting the CD44 and NCL receptors may provide promising therapeutic strategies to modulate inflammation and promote tissue repair after SCI.

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections involve prolonged viral replication and immune system interactions, potentially driving viral evolution and immune escape. This study examines viral characteristics and host gene expression changes in persistent infections. The nasopharyngeal samples from four patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections at Tottori University Hospital, Japan, were analyzed. Viral isolates were cultured, and infectivity was assessed using TCID50 assays. To investigate host responses, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis mapped affected biological pathways. Viral genome sequencing detected mutations associated with prolonged infection. The results showed significant infectivity differences between early- and late-phase infection. Gene expression analysis revealed a strong early phase of pro-inflammatory response (IL6, TNF, IL1B, CXCL10) followed by immune suppression. GO enrichment analysis highlighted inflammation and cytokine-mediated immune pathways. Genomic sequencing identified mutations in ORF1ab and the spike (S) protein, potentially aiding immune escape. The findings underscore that SARS-CoV-2 adapts during persistent infections, altering infectivity and immune responses. These highlight the need for continued monitoring of prolonged infections to mitigate immune escape and viral evolution.">

        <tr id="Purpose Cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significant variability, yet the role of innate immune responses in the skin of COVID-19 patients remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic profile of skin samples from patients who succumbed to COVID-19. Patients and Methods Skin autopsies from COVID-19 patients with post-mortem time of less than 20 hours were obtained from University of São Paulo Medical School Hospital and healthy skin samples, were submitted to RNA sequencing analysis. Validation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by real-Time PCR. Results Our analysis revealed markedly elevated expression of type I interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral factors, antioxidant enzymes, and components of several cytokine-signaling pathways in COVID-19 skin samples compared to healthy controls. SARS-CoV-2 infection robustly induced numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFITs, IRF, S100 family with a notable enrichment of those associated with antiviral and inflammatory responses. Moreover, the presence of counter-regulatory factors such as SOCS3 and NFKBIA indicate the involvement of anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the skin. Furthermore, deconvolution data indicated increased presence of macrophages other nucleated cells in vessels in the skin of COVID-19 patients, highlighting the involvement of innate immune mechanisms. Conclusion The results revealed cutaneous alterations in the expression of genes associated with innate immunity and inflammation factors. This suggests that, unlike tissues with viral tropism, the skin is enriched with antiviral factors to defend against SARS-CoV-2. This information could be useful for developing specific antiviral therapies.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic pathogen linked to neuropathogenesis in adults, causing conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and fatal encephalitis. Intracranial injection of virus in immunocompromised mice have shown neuroinflammation and subsequent brain damage. However, the mechanisms underlying ZIKV-induced neuroinflammation in immunocompetent adult mice via peripheral infection remain unclear. To investigate this, we utilized a murine model of ZIKV infection via footpad injection. Our findings reveal that acute ZIKV infection at 4 days post-infection (4 dpi) induces significant apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the adult brain, persisting up to 28 dpi. Notably, ZIKV infection triggers apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex—key regions involved in memory—and induces early immune cell infiltration. Additionally, microglial activation occurs following infection at 7 dpi, with viral RNA detected in the brain. Bulk RNA sequencing of the hippocampus at 28 dpi further reveals the activation of inflammatory pathways, underscoring the prolonged neuroinflammatory response in the infected brain. Microglial activation is likely driven by infiltrating monocytes, as inhibiting monocyte recruitment reduced the expression of microglial activation genes. These results suggest that targeting monocyte-induced inflammatory mediators could be potential therapeutic interventions for ZIKV.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has underscored the need to understand the virus’s evolution due to its global health impact. This study employed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to analyze gene expression differences across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We used publicly available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with IDs GSE157103, GSE171110, GSE189039, and GSE201530, which contain RNA-Seq data extracted from white blood cells, whole blood, or PBMCs of individuals infected with the Original Wuhan variant (both hospitalized and non-hospitalized), the French variant (hospitalized), the Beta variant (hospitalized), and the Omicron variant (moderate and mild cases), along with COVID-negative controls. Our first objective was to examine differences in gene expression dynamics using Generalized Linear Models with Quasi-Likelihood F-tests and the Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (GLMQL-MAS) technique, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. Our second objective was to employ Cross-MAS to identify a robust set of genes indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the variant and to assess their classification performance. GO and pathway analyses revealed a significant evolutionary shift in how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host. Early variants such as the Original Wuhan and French cases primarily affected pathways related to viral replication, including Eukaryotic Translation Elongation and Viral mRNA Translation. In contrast, later variants like Beta and Omicron showed a strategic shift toward modulating and evading the host immune response, engaging immune-related pathways such as Interferon Alpha/Beta signaling and Cytokine signaling in the immune system. To evaluate the classification potential of the identified genes, we tested them on held-out datasets GSE152418, PMC8202013, GSE161731, and GSE166190, which contain RNA-Seq data from whole blood or PBMCs of COVID-positive and healthy individuals. Using top-ranked genes such as IFI27, CDC20, RRM2, HJURP, and CDC45 in linear models including logistic regression and linear SVM, we achieved 97.31% accuracy, with precision and recall rates of 0.97 and 0.99, respectively. These signatures also achieved perfect classification (100% accuracy, precision, and recall) in two additional datasets: GSE294888, which includes blood-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (DC2s) stimulated with Delta or Omicron variants, and GSE239595, which features Omicron-infected nasopharyngeal tissue. These findings demonstrate the potential of transcriptomic signatures for variant-agnostic COVID-19 detection and provide a foundation for flexible diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in response to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="Innate immune cells appear to have an important implication in the resolution and/or the aggravation of the COVID-19 pathogenesis after infection with SARS-CoV-2. To better appreciate the role of these cells during COVID-19, changes in blood eosinophil, the neutrophil and monocyte count, and levels of surface protein markers have been reported. However, analyses at several timepoints of multiple surface markers on granulocytes and monocytes over a period of one month after a SARS-CoV-2 infection are missing. Therefore, in this study, we performed blood eosinophil, neutrophil, and monocyte phenotyping using a list of surface proteins and flow cytometry during a period of 30 days after the hospitalization of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Blood cell counts were reported at seven different timepoints over the 30-day period as well as measures of multiple mediators in serum using a targeted multiplex assay approach. Our results indicate a 95% drop in the blood eosinophil count by D1, with eosinophils displaying a phenotype defined as CD69/CD63/CD125high and CCR3/CD44low during the early phases of hospitalization. Conversely, by D7 the neutrophil count increased significantly and displayed an immature, activated, and immunosuppressive phenotype (i.e., 3% of CD10/CD16low and CD10lowCD177high, 6.7% of CD11bhighCD62Llow, and 1.6% of CD16highCD62Llow), corroborated by enhanced serum proteins that are markers of neutrophil activation. Finally, our results suggest a rapid recruitment of non-classical monocytes leaving CD163/CD64high and CD32low monocytes in circulation during the very early phase. In conclusion, our study reveals potential very early roles for eosinophils and monocytes in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 with a likely reprogramming of eosinophils in the bone marrow. The exact roles of the pro-inflammatory neutrophils and the functions of the eosinophils and the monocytes, as well as these innate immune cell types, interplays need to be further investigated.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system can develop a form of memory called priming, where prior exposure to a stimulus enhances subsequent responses. While well-characterized in peripheral immunity, its function in brain-resident cells such as astrocytes under non-disease conditions remains unclear. Here we show that human astrocytes derived from the induced pluripotent stem cells of healthy female donors, but not microglia, acquire a primed state following transient immune stimulations. Upon subsequent exposure to amyloid-β (Aβ), these astrocytes secrete elevated levels of cytokines and promote microglial Aβ uptake. In contrast, astrocytes carrying the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk allele APOE4 exhibit reduced priming and fail to support microglial phagocytosis. These findings are validated in astrocyte-microglial co-cultures, cerebral organoids, and male mice, where astrocyte priming enhances Aβ clearance in an APOE4-sensitive manner. Our findings identify astrocytic immune memory as a modulator of microglial function and Aβ pathology, providing insights into how early protective responses in AD may be disrupted by genetic risk factors.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 shows a high incidence of pulmonary thrombosis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. We have performed RNA sequencing of isolated endothelial cells (ECs) from infected mid-aged and young mice. Compared to young mice, Integrinβ3 (ITGB3) expression levels were higher in ECs of mid-aged mice which showed thrombosis in lungs. SARS-CoV-2 exposure increased the number of adhered platelets on the EC monolayer in vitro. Knockdown of ITGB3 in ECs decreased platelet adhesion to them. Among the molecules known as SARS-CoV-2 receptors, Kringle-containing transmembrane protein 1 contributed to ITGB3 upregulation in ECs by SARS-CoV-2. Histological analysis showed that ITGB3-positive blood vessels were frequently detected not only in infected-mid-aged mouse lungs but also in COVID-19-affected human autopsy lungs. This study suggests that the induction of ITGB3 expression in ECs is one of the mechanisms of thrombosis in severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: COVID-19 has been associated with a wide range of immune responses, including the production of autoantibodies, particularly in severe cases. This study investigates the IgG autoantibody responses in patients with varying severities of COVID-19 infection and compares these responses with vaccinated individuals. Methods: We utilized proteomic profiling to analyze autoantibody reactivity against a broad spectrum of proteins expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets in serum samples from severe and moderate COVID-19 patients, as well as vaccinated individuals who received the inactivated CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccine. Results: Our findings indicate a marked increase in the diversity and number of IgG autoantibodies targeting intracellular and membrane-associated proteins in severe COVID-19 cases, compared to those with moderate cases of the disease. The autoantibody response in severe cases was found to primarily target proteins involved in immune cell activation, signaling, and differentiation, suggesting potential pathways of immune dysregulation and autoimmunity. In contrast, vaccinated individuals did not exhibit similar autoantibody reactivity, pointing to a more controlled immune response post-vaccination. Notably, no significant autoimmune responses were detected in the vaccinated cohort, suggesting that the inactivated vaccine does not induce autoreactive IgG. These findings align with the established safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines, especially in comparison to the heightened immune dysregulation observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The absence of a significant autoantibody response in vaccinated individuals supports the notion that vaccines, while inducing robust immune activation, do not typically trigger autoimmunity in healthy individuals. Conclusions: Our study underscores the importance of distinguishing between the immune responses triggered by infection and vaccination and highlights the need for the continued monitoring of autoimmune responses in severe COVID-19 cases. Future research should focus on the long-term persistence and clinical relevance of these autoantibodies, particularly in individuals with pre-existing autoimmune conditions or genetic predispositions.">

        <tr id="Aging leads to a progressive decline in overall bladder function resulting in lower urinary tract symptoms and increased susceptibility to infections. However, tissue-specific mechanisms of aging, specifically the contributions of the aged urothelium remain elusive. Here, we introduce mouse bladder epithelium-derived organoids (mBEDOs) as a scalable platform to model urothelial aging. mBEDOs from aged mice recapitulate key features of age-associated cellular reprogramming, including oxidative stress, senescence, and DNA damage. We demonstrate the utility of mBEDOs for modeling Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infection, generating assembloids between mBEDOs and macrophages to model epithelial-immune interactions, and genetic perturbation. Using the mBEDO platform, we also identify urothelium-specific changes in purine, amino acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism which may contribute to age-associated cellular perturbations. Lastly, supplementation with depleted metabolites, nicotinamide (NAM) and D-mannose, reduce DNA damage and oxidative stress and restore mitochondrial integrity in aged mBEDOs. These findings establish mBEDOs as an effective platform for investigating molecular and cellular underpinnings of urothelial aging and exploring metabolism-based interventions for age-associated bladder dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression. Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.">

        <tr id="Background: Circulating degranulated platelets have been described during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated with COVID-19 complications. This study investigated the relationship between the presence of plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ie, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia), systemic inflammation, and platelet dysfunction in a group of patients with COVID-19. Unlike our previous publication, which focused on platelet characterization, this work explores potential determinants of platelet activation, based on a distinct subset of patients with available stored samples. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 were stratified by platelet δ-granule content using the luciferin/luciferase assay into 2 groups: normal (COVδ-norm) and low (COVδ-low). Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia (RT-qPCR), cytokines, and chemokines (Cytometric Bead Array) were quantified on plasma samples. Markers of platelet activation were measured by flow cytometry in whole blood. Results: A total of 75 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled; 57 presented normal levels of platelet δ-granule content (COVδ-norm) and 18 had low levels of platelet δ-granules (COVδ-low). Groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia levels. Patients in the COVδ-low group showed significantly higher chemokine and cytokine levels compared to those in the COVδ-norm group, with strong correlations between IL-6, as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with platelet degranulation parameters. A similar trend, albeit less pronounced, was observed when patients were stratified based on their platelet activation phenotype. Conclusions: These findings suggest that peripheral inflammation, rather than SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, is associated with platelet dysfunction during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms by which Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) infection leads to acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a severe neurological condition characterized by sudden muscle weakness and paralysis, remain poorly understood. To investigate the cellular tropism and infection dynamics of EV-D68, we profiled naive and EV-D68-infected human spinal cord organoids (hSCOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Examining the cellular composition of healthy hSCOs, we found that hSCOs comprise diverse cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and multipotent glial progenitor cells (mGPCs). Upon infection with two EV-D68 strains, US/IL/14-18952 (a B2 strain) and US/MA/18-23089 (a B3 strain), we observed distinct viral tropism and host transcriptional responses. Notably, US/IL/14-18952 showed a significant preference for neurons, while US/MA/18-23089 exhibited higher rates of infection in cycling astrocytes and OPCs. These findings provide novel insights into the host cell tropism of EV-D68 in the spinal cord, offering insight into the potential mechanisms underlying AFM pathogenesis. Understanding the dynamics of infection at single-cell resolution will inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the neurological impact of enteroviral infections.">

Using single-cell technology, we analyzed infected pig spleens and found macrophages—a type of immune cell—to be the virus’s primary target. Infection depletes disease-fighting cells while favoring virus-supportive conditions. We identified four macrophage subtypes, including one highly susceptible to infection and another with antiviral properties that is rapidly destroyed. The viral E165R gene was essential for ASFV replication while disrupting host defense signals. By tracking cellular changes, we revealed how macrophages drive ASFV progression. Our findings offer insights for future therapies against this global threat.">

        <tr id="Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect substantial populations worldwide and increase the risk of developing cognitive impairments and alcohol-associated dementia. While chronic inflammatory signaling likely plays an important role in alcohol-associated neurological sequalae, the precise mechanisms underlying alcohol-associated neuropathology remain enigmatic. We hypothesize that alcohol leads to neuroimmune dysregulation among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia; and is perpetuated by innate immune signaling pathways involving cell-cell signaling. To investigate how alcohol dysregulates neuroimmune interactions in a human context, we constructed a triculture model comprising neurons, astrocytes, and microglia derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. After exposure to ethanol, we observed significant differential gene expression relating to innate immune pathways, inflammation, and microglial activation. Microglial activation was confirmed with morphological analysis and expression of CD68, a lysosomal-associated membrane protein and marker for phagocytic microglial activation. A striking finding in our study was the elevation of TREM2 expression and, specifically, TREM2 alternative splice variants that are predicted to give rise to soluble TREM2 . These results suggest that ethanol exposure in the brain may lead to increased microglial activation and production of soluble isoform named TREM2219 through alternate splicing. Deciphering the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning ethanol-related neuroimmune dysregulation within a human context promises to shed light on the etiology of AUD-related disorders, potentially contributing to the development of effective therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the profound and lasting impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system. Beyond acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent, disrupting immune homeostasis and contributing to persistent inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, neuropathy, and mood disturbances. These are linked to immune dysregulation involving cytokine imbalance, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, glial activation, and T-cell exhaustion. Key biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NFL) correlate with disease severity and chronicity. This narrative review examines the immunopathological mechanisms underpinning the neurological sequelae of long COVID, focusing on neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and molecular mimicry. We also assess the role of viral variants in shaping neuroimmune outcomes and explore emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including biomarker-guided and immune-targeted interventions. By delineating how SARS-CoV-2 reshapes neuroimmune interactions, this review aims to support the development of precision-based diagnostics and targeted therapies for long COVID-related neurological dysfunction. Emerging approaches include immune-modulatory agents (e.g., anti-IL-6), neuroprotective drugs, and strategies for repurposing antiviral or anti-inflammatory compounds in neuro-COVID. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities, personalized therapies guided by biomarkers and patient-specific immune profiles may be essential. Advancements in vaccine technologies and targeted biologics may also hold promise for prevention and disease modification. Finally, continued interdisciplinary research is needed to clarify the complex virus–immune–brain axis in long COVID and inform effective clinical management.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a severe neurological condition associated with high rates of mortality or long‐term disability. Despite its clinical significance, the detailed cellular mechanisms underlying HIE remain unclear. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity across development, aging, and disease processes. However, no scRNA‐seq studies have yet addressed neonatal HIE. In this study, we employed scRNA‐seq to examine cellular heterogeneity during neonatal HIE. We analyzed a total of 87 580 high‐quality brain cells to identify transcriptional changes associated with HIE. In the hyperacute phase, we observed astrocytes in response to tumor necrosis factors, involvement of microglia in phagocytosis, Stat3‐mediated ischemic responses in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and an increase in senescent lymphatic endothelial cells. In the acute phase, astrocytes were activated and involved in gliogenesis, while microglia proliferated. Neuroblasts were affected by metal ions, and oligodendrocytes decreased. In the subacute phase, astrocytes involved in inflammation and antigen presentation, while inflammatory microglia highly expressing MHC II were induced by the IL27 and type I interferon pathways and expanded. Additionally, peripheral immune cells played vital roles in HIE. Specifically, neutrophils infiltrated and expanded throughout all phases post‐HIE. Spp1 high macrophages, T cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells increased during the acute and subacute phases, and B cells expanded during the subacute phase. This study offers deep insights into the molecular alterations of key cell types following HIE, elucidating the pathological processes involved. These findings have significant implications for developing effective clinical strategies for managing HIE.">

        <tr id="The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed unprecedented challenges to public health and economic stability. Central to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is its ability to evade the host immune response by hijacking host pathways via the interaction between viral and host proteins. We identified Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1/2 (G3BP1/G3BP2) as a critical host factor that interacts with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, emerging from a comparative analysis of proteomic data from multiple studies. We revisited the underlying molecular mechanisms by confirming the residues required for the interaction between G3BP1/G3BP2 and SARS-CoV-2 N protein and showed that this interaction disrupts stress granule formation. Intriguingly, we observed that the ablation of both G3BP1 and G3BP2 enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our data collectively supports the notion that G3BP1 and G3BP2 play a critical role in modulating the host–virus interface during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that their multifaceted function in cellular defense extends beyond the stress granule pathway.">

        <tr id="Background Myeloid cells, such as resident microglia (MG), infiltrating monocytes (Mo), macrophages (MΦ), and CNS border-associated macrophages (BAM) in the brain, participate in aged brain injury. Aged microglial replacement is protective against brain injury in aged mice; however, whether/how the molecular changes in myeloid cells are affected by this replacement in injured brains remains unclear. Methods Aged microglia in mice were eliminated by PLX3397 for 21 consecutive days and repopulated following withdrawal for 21 days; then, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) models were constructed. Then, a single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of acutely injured brains in aged mice with microglial replacement was performed. Results We observed similarities but strong divergence in the composition and molecular change features of myeloid cells between the replacement (Rep) and control (Con) groups, indicating retention of the core transcriptome and development of differential genes in myeloid cells after microglial replacement in response to brain injury. Both MG and Mo/MΦ experience modification of immune responses after microglial repopulation, with more prominent changes in MG. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that one term directly related to the “immune response” was shared between upregulated genes in Rep-MG and Rep-Mo/MΦ, while the other terms related to immune functions and other biofunctions were different between Rep-MG and Rep-Mo/MΦ, indicative of significantly different immune responses to brain injury between MG and MΦ. Furthermore, the trajectory analysis showed a significant transition from aged to young state in Rep-MG compared to only a modest youthful shift in Rep-Mo/MΦ, suggesting a rejuvenation process of aged microglia and macrophages toward young ones in response to brain injury after the treatment of microglial replacement. Conclusion Our data indicate that microglial replacement-induced changes in the molecular heterogeneity and state transition of myeloid cells may be neuroprotective against acute brain injury.">

        <tr id="Aims Macrophage-mediated inflammatory response plays a pivotal role in the pathological process of myocardial infarction (MI). Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) shed light on the differentiation and function of macrophage subsets post-MI, it failed to capture protein-level changes, limiting comprehensive assessment. Methods To address this limitation, first, we analyzed the scRNA-seq data from ArrayExpress, after comprehensive quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and clustering analyses, macrophage subsets were systematically classified and annotated using established computational pipelines. Then, these computational classifications were validated through rigorous animal experiments. Finally, we integrated proteomic data from our experimental model and scRNA-seq to analyze the effect of protein modification changes in macrophage subsets on prognosis post-MI. Results A total of seven macrophage clusters were identified and annotated, including Spp1hiMac, MHCIIhiMac, Ltc4shiMac, Lyve1hiMac, DcnhiMac, Ly6c1hiMono and Stmn1hiMac. Spp1hiMac and Ltc4shiMac, linked to leukocyte migration and chemotaxis, peaked at 3 days. MHCIIhiMac and and DcnhiMac, involved in antigen processing and presentation and collagen fibril organization, peaked at 7 days. Lyve1hiMac reduced on days 3 and 7, and by day 28 returned to baseline levels. By integrating scRNA-seq and proteomics, there 78, 126, and 64 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in macrophages were obtained at 3, 7 and 28 days, respectively. At 3 days, DEPs were linked to inflammation, protein processing and maturation. At 7 days, DEPs were enriched in regulation of actin filament organization and cellular response to interferon-gamma. At 28 days, DEPs exhibited inhibitory effects on inflammation, cell apoptosis and migration. The post-translational modifications (PTMs) of DEPs involved phosphorylation, acetylation and lactylation, and these DEPs are mainly associated with inflammation, fibrosis and cytoskeletal organization, including Marcks, Anxa2, Vim, Dcn, Tpm3 and so on. Conclusion By integrating scRNAseq and proteomics data, this study provides a comprehensive overview of heterogeneity and dynamic protein level changes of macrophages post-MI, and characterizes the PTMs in macrophages, and lays the groundwork for developing targeted interventions tailored to specific cell types and time points post-MI.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunity response following vaccination and infection toward the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant remains limited in chronic liver disease (CLD) population. This study aims to investigate humoral and cell-mediate immunity to Omicron BA.4/5 among CLD patients with/without breakthrough infections (BI). This longitudinal study characterized immune responses to Omicron infection across three CLD patient groups: vaccinated without BI (group 1, n = 10), vaccinated with BI (group 2, n = 43), and unvaccinated infected (group 3, n = 7). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies/T-cell responses and lymphocyte phenotypes were quantified by ELISA and flow cytometry. Logistic regression identified immunological correlates of BI event, viral clearance and liver disease progression. Dynamic immunity changes after infection analyzed using Spearman’s correlation. Patients in group 2 exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.4.5, anti-RBD IgG, and total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to groups 1 and 3. Comparable T cell responses were observed between two vaccinated groups, stronger than unvaccinated individuals. Hybrid immune (vaccination plus infection) elicited stronger NAbs-WT, total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, anti-RBD IgG, MBCs, and Omicron-specific IFN-γ+/IL-4+CD4+T cells compared to primary Omicron infection. Besides, severe liver disease was not only a risk factor for BI, but also impaired Omicron-specific IFN-γ+CD8+T, CD38+CD4+T, and CD45RA+CD8+T cells responses after infection. Importantly, IgG+/IgM+MBCs and NAbs showed positive associations with central memory (CD45RA−CD62L+CD4/8) or naive (CD45RA+CD62L+CD4) T cells. Low levels of CD45RA+CD62L+CD8+T cells and resting MBCs were identified as the independent risk factors for viral clearance and disease progression, respectively. BI predominantly stimulates humoral immunity without enhancing cellular responses. Weaker immune response induced by primary Omicron infection underscores the need for additional vaccinations in vaccine-naïve CLD patients. The positive correlations between humoral/cellular immunity and memory/activated T cells reveal their coordinated role in adaptive immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. These findings emphasize the importance of regular immune monitoring and timely interventions to optimize protection for CLD patients against emerging Omicron subvariants.">

        <tr id="Introduction Multi-specific and long-lasting T-cell immunity has been recognized to indicate long-term protection against pathogens, including the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Functional significance of peripheral memory T cells in individuals recovered from COVID-19 (COVID-19+) is beginning to be appreciated; however, the role of lung tissue-resident memory (lung TRM) T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still being investigated. This is, in part, due to the lack of preclinical tissue models available to follow the convalescence period. Methods Here, we utilize a perfused three-dimensional (3D) human lung-tissue model and show pre-existing local T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 proteins in lung tissues. Results We report ex vivo maintenance of functional multi-specific IFN-γ-secreting lung TRM T cells in COVID-19+ and their induction in lung tissues of vaccinated COVID-19+ subjects. Importantly, we identify SARS-CoV-2 peptide-responding memory B cells and IgA+ plasma cells in ex vivo cultured lung tissues of COVID-19+. Furthermore, lung tissue IgA levels were increased in COVID-19+ and responded to peptide stimulation. Discussion In our study, we highlight the importance of utilization of human lung-tissue models to understand the local antiviral immune response in the lung to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background In late 2022, Beijing, China saw a large-scale BF.7 Omicron variant breakthrough infection. However, the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on elderly breakthrough-infected patients’ antibodies and immune cells response was unclear. Methods We recruited 329 inpatients over 65 with BF.7 breakthrough infections. We analyzed the link between vaccination and survival in 67 sampled patients, investigating changes in antibody levels, cytokine profiles, as well as immune phenotypes. Results Experiments revealed that while vaccination could raise antibody levels in the elderly, it showed no significant neutralizing activity against the emerging COVID-19 variant XBB. Flow cytometry showed vaccination increased the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Moreover, we found that elevated frequencies of CD4+ Tsens cells were associated with reduced antigen-specific CD4+ T cell activation, diminished IL-2 production, and lower proportions of Tfh cells, which ultimately leading to impaired neutralizing antibody production, particularly against new emerging variants. Conclusions We found the immunological efficacy of inactivated vaccines in elderly patients is influenced by the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Future elderly vaccination strategies need optimization in dose number and timing, and future vaccine design should aim to minimize the generation of CD4+ senescent T cells.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with platelet hyperreactivity and increased rates of arterial and venous thrombosis. SARS-CoV-2 mutations have resulted in several variants with differences in transmissibility, infectivity, and patient outcomes. This study investigates the effects of the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 (WA1) and two variants of concern, Delta and Omicron, on the human megakaryocyte (MK) phenotype and transcriptome. Human CD34+-derived MKs were incubated with WA1, Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants for 24 hours. MK activation markers were measured under resting and thrombin-stimulated conditions. RNA-seq and cytokine release in response to the viruses were assessed. Plasma cytokines were measured in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Treatment of MKs with WA1, Delta or Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in similar increases in classical activation markers. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants mediated distinct transcriptomic changes. Across variants, 60 genes overlapped, including CXCL8. Consistent with transcriptomic changes, SARS-CoV-2-incubated MKs secreted significantly elevated levels of IL-8. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, plasma IL-8 levels were highest in COVID-19 patients who subsequently experienced thrombotic events or died. In conclusion, WA1, Delta, and Omicron similarly induce classical MK activation responses while mediating distinct transcriptomic changes. Increased IL-8 levels may serve as a biomarker to inform platelet hyperreactivity and thrombotic events associated with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Influenza viruses with pandemic potential and possible burden of post-viral sequelae are a global concern. To prepare for future pandemics and the development of improved vaccines, it is vital to identify the immunological changes underlying influenza disease severity. Methods We combined unsupervised high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry with gene expression analyses, plasma CXCL13 measurements, and antigen-specific immune cell assays to characterize the immune profiles of hospitalized patients with severe and moderate seasonal influenza disease during active infection and at 6-month follow-up. We used age-matched healthy donors as controls. Results Severe disease was associated with a distinct immune profile, including lower frequencies of ICOS+ mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and CXCR5+ memory B and CD4+CXCR5+CD95+ICOS+ and CD8+CXCR3+CD95+PD-1+TIGIT+ memory T cells, as well as lower CD4 gene expression. Higher frequencies of CD16+CD161+ NK cells, CD169+ monocytes, CD123+/− dendritic cells, and CD38high plasma cells and high CXCL13 plasma levels were also associated with severe disease. Alterations in immune cell subpopulations persisted at convalescence for the severely ill patients only. Conclusions Our results indicated a reduction in regulatory MAIT cells and memory T and B cells and an increase in the inhibitory subpopulations of monocytes and NK cells in severe influenza that persisted at convalescence. These immune cell alterations were associated with higher age and the presence of several underlying conditions that may contribute to frailty. This study illustrates the power and sensitivity of high-dimensional single-cell analyses in identifying potential cellular biomarkers for disease severity after influenza infection.">

        <tr id="Severe viral infections can precipitate acute lung injury, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. While NETosis serves as an important defense mechanism against pathogens and viruses, its excessive or dysregulated activation may contribute to pulmonary damage. In this study, elevated levels of NETosis were detected in the peripheral blood of patients with viral pneumonia. To further investigate the relationship between NETosis and virus-induced acute lung injury, a murine model was established using intratracheal administration of poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA that mimics viral infection. NETosis biomarkers were assessed in both patients and poly(I:C)-stimulated mice. In addition, we examined the role of the Hippo signaling pathway and its downstream mediators, including inflammatory factors and chemokines. Enhanced NETosis and activation of the Hippo pathway were observed in the lungs of poly(I:C)-treated mice, along with elevated levels of IL-1β in isolated macrophages. These effects were mitigated by Hippo pathway inhibitors. Co-culture experiments confirmed that IL-1β promotes NETosis, while NLRP3, acting downstream of the Hippo pathway, was responsible for IL-1β secretion. Patients with viral pneumonia showed increased NLRP3 and IL-1β expression in monocyte-derived macrophages compared to healthy controls. Overall, our findings indicate that activation of the Hippo pathway in macrophages during poly(I:C) exposure upregulates NLRP3 and IL-1β expression, thereby promoting NETosis and exacerbating virus-induced lung injury. This study highlights a potential therapeutic target to reduce lung damage caused by viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but severe complication that arises between two and six weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanisms underlying why only a subset of children develop this hyperinflammatory response remain unclear. Methods We performed an in-depth proteomic analysis of plasma samples from children before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those who developed MIS-C. Proteomic profiling was conducted using high-throughput technologies, and findings were validated using publicly available datasets. Results Healthy children showed minimal changes in the circulating proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of ongoing inflammation. In contrast, children with MIS-C exhibited significant activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and elevated circulating markers of myocardial and vascular injury. Conclusions Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection alone does not cause sustained proteomic alterations in most children. However, MIS-C is associated with a distinct inflammatory and vascular injury signature. Several candidate diagnostic biomarkers for MIS-C were identified and validated in silico, offering promising avenues for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Different functional T lymphocytes play important roles in the progression of IAV infection, including proliferation, recruitment, and effector activity. However, the immune changes of T cells during IAV infection are unclear, and the related targets are still to be explored. In this study, we used a multi-omics approach combining transcriptome and single-cell transcriptome analysis to identify TXN as a key target gene and elucidate its close association with T-cell proliferation. From these data, we identified 10 key differential genes through a combination of differential analysis, WGCNA, and Friends analysis and further identified that only TXN and S100A6 co-existed in the highly variable genes of proliferative T cells. Because TXN exhibits highly specific high expression in proliferative T cells, we focused on its related research and ultimately identified it as a target gene for IAV infection. Reports have suggested that simultaneous inhibition of the GSH and TXN pathways can effectively trigger cell death. This proves our hypothesis about a new direction of T cell death in IAV infection. Additionally, we found that T cell development after IAV infection was regulated and altered, but this study did not clearly explain whether it was negative regulation. In summary, we have identified TXN as a target gene involved in T cell proliferation during IAV infection, and we suggest that its expression may be associated with non-apoptotic forms of T cell death.

        <tr id="Optic neuropathies, including glaucoma, are characterized by the progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), ultimately leading to irreversible vision loss. Increasing evidence implicates microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, as key modulators of RGC health and disease progression. However, the precise mechanisms by which microglia influence RGCs remain poorly understood, particularly in the human context. In this study, we established human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived co-culture systems incorporating microglia, astrocytes, and RGCs to explore how microglia shape RGC growth and maturation under physiological conditions. We first examined the impact of homeostatic microglia on RGCs in both co-culture and tri-culture systems, revealing distinct influences of cell types in co-culture compared to when they were grown individually. We then modeled inflammatory states by activating microglia with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and evaluated their effects on RGCs both directly and in the context of astrocyte co-culture. This stepwise, reductionist approach enabled us to dissect the cellular interactions driving RGC vulnerability in inflammatory conditions relevant to optic neuropathies. Our findings provide new insight into the complex neuroimmune landscape that underlies RGC degeneration and identify key pathways that may serve as therapeutic targets across a range of optic nerve diseases.">

In our clinical observations, we identified that this hyperinflammatory state was correlated with reduced mRNA expression of both Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-Induced Protein 8-like Protein 2 (TIPE2)—an immune negative modulator—and the ferroptosis marker gene Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of these patients. Given the emerging evidence that macrophage polarization and dysfunction play pivotal roles in COVID-19 progression, we established a THP-1-derived macrophage model stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to mimic the host immune response. Our results demonstrated that TIPE2 modulates S protein-induced macrophage polarization and ferroptosis, specifically by suppressing M1 polarization associated with inflammation and encouraging M2 polarization linked to anti-inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that TIPE2 mediates critical immunomodulatory effects during the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating pathological inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients gravely affected.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (PE), a hypertensive disorder, but the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify ORF3a, a SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein, as a key factor in placental dysfunction, driving autophagy dysregulation, trophoblast maturation impairment, protein aggregation and placental barrier disruption–processes linked to PE. We detect ORF3a in placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 along with increased protein aggregation and disrupted tight junctions in ORF3a + regions. In placental cell lines, ORF3a impairs syncytiotrophoblast maturation and induces protein aggregation. Mechanistically, ORF3a binds to ZO-1 via its PDZ-binding motif (SVPL), and deletion of this domain from ORF3a abrogates its effect on trophoblast barrier integrity. In human trophoblast cells engineered with an LC3-GFP-mCherry reporter, ORF3a induces autophagosome accumulation, and shifts autophagy toward a secretory pathway with elevated levels of CD63 + extracellular vesicles and disrupted ZO-1 localization, all of which are recapitulated by live infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. These ORF3a-dependent changes are fully recapitulated in 3D stem-cell-derived trophoblast organoids (SC-TOs). Together, our findings define a molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection compromises placental syncytial integrity. Targeting ORF3a may provide a therapeutic strategy to mitigate PE-like placental dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2–infected pregnancies.">

This highlights the need to study the humoral immune response to better understand the pathophysiology of viral respiratory infections and improve treatments and diagnostics. This study analyzed autoantibody and acute-phase reactant profiles in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A using customized protein microarrays for sensitive and reproducible results. The findings revealed a significant increase in autoantibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients, including those targeting calcitonin-related polypeptides, hepatocyte growth factor, or interleukin 8, compared to Influenza A patients, who showed elevated levels of selectin E and surfactant protein D. Additionally, most acute-phase reactants were higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The serological profile showed that the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain induced both IgM and IgG responses to all viral proteins, while other strains triggered an IgG response only at a later stage. Multiomics factor analysis identified key factors driving variation in COVID-19's heterogeneous disease presentation.

        <tr id="Introduction Macrophages play fundamental roles in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, serving as one of the primary cell types that orchestrate tissue repair after injury. MiR-210 is a hypoxia-inducible, small non-coding RNA involved in regulating metabolic adaptation and inflammatory responses during normal repair processes. However, its role in macrophage polarization is not fully understood. Here, we report the impact of miR-210 deletion on macrophage polarization towards a pro-reparatory phenotype. Methods Bone marrow-derived macrophages were obtained from miR-210 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice and polarized toward the pro-reparative M2 phenotype. The transcriptomic profile of these cells, as well as their phagocytic capacity, cell energy phenotype, and cytokine production were assessed to determine the impact of miR-210 on the macrophage polarization process into a M2-like phenotype. Results Compared with their WT counterparts, miR-210 KO M0 macrophages presented a reduced glycolytic activity and a diminished metabolic flexibility. However, miR-210 KO cells exhibited increased phagocytosis in both M0 and M2 states, potentially as an adaptive response to their metabolic limitations. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct clustering between the M0 and M2 states, along with several notable differences in the transcriptional patterns between the two genotypes. Analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated an increased pro-inflammatory state in resting miR-210 KO macrophages compared to WT control cells. These data were further confirmed by the higher levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1b secreted by miR-210 KO M0 macrophages compared to WT cells. Analysis of the biological processes activated during the polarization process towards the M2 phenotype revealed an incomplete polarization of miR-210 KO cells, which may be attributed, at least in part, to reduced activation of mitotic regulators, leading to slower cell cycle progression and diminished proliferation. Discussion Our data offers new insights into the role of miR-210 in promoting a macrophage shift toward the anti-inflammatory, pro-reparative M2 phenotype. The fine-tuned involvement of miR-210 in immune responses may have potential implications for chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and tissue repair.">

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is not only a key structural protein but also instrumental in mediating the host immune response, contributing significantly to inflammation and viral pathogenesis. Due to its immunogenic properties, SARS-CoV-2 N protein also interacts with host factors associated with various pre-existing inflammatory conditions and may possibly contribute to the long-term symptoms suffered by some COVID-19 patients after recovery—known as long COVID. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in elucidating the biological functions of the N protein. In particular, it highlights the mechanisms by which the N protein contributes to host inflammatory responses and elaborates on its association with long COVID and pre-existing inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Chronic migraine (CM) is a debilitating neurological disorder, yet the glial-specific mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC)—a critical hub for craniofacial pain processing—remain poorly understood. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to resolve cell-type-specific transcriptional landscapes in a nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced CM rat model, with a particular focus on microglia and astrocytes. We identified 19 transcriptional clusters representing nine major cell types, among which reactive microglia (NTG-Mic) and astrocytes (NTG-Asts) were markedly expanded. The NTG-Mic displayed a glycolysis-dominant, complement-enriched state, whereas the NTG-Asts exhibited concurrent activation of amino acid transport and cytokine signaling pathways. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed bifurcated glial activation paths, with NTG driving both cell types toward terminal reactive states. Intercellular communication inference uncovered suppressed homeostatic interactions (e.g., CSF1-CSF1R) alongside enhanced proinflammatory signaling (e.g., FGF1-FGFR2, PTN-SDC4), particularly affecting neuron–glia and glia–glia crosstalk. Together, these findings define a high-resolution atlas of glial reprogramming in CM, implicating state-specific metabolic–immune transitions and dysregulated glial communication as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological alterations, ranging from headache and dizziness to severe encephalopathy and inflammatory neurological diseases (IND), and neuropathological findings suggest immune-mediated processes. Therefore, we sought to characterize profiles of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and markers of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis in COVID-19 patients with neurological alterations to identify key factors and mechanisms underlying CNS disturbances in COVID-19. The study included a case series of 52 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations, which were categorized into three groups: isolated refractory headache (n = 14), encephalopathy (n = 24), and IND (n = 14). Individuals with non-inflammatory, non-infectious neurological conditions (n = 9) were included as negative controls. Paired CSF and serum samples were assessed for 56 biomarkers. Regardless of the neurological condition, COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated CSF levels of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-15, IL-25, IFN-α2, CCL7, CCL11, and GM-CSF. Patients with encephalopathy and IND also showed increased IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, neopterin, IL-7, CXCL8, CXCL9, TGF-α, EGF, sTREM-2, and HMGB1, consistent with a CNS cytokine storm. In contrast, individuals with isolated refractory headache showed a modest inflammatory profile, compatible with the limited CNS involvement. COVID-19 patients showed elevated serum IL-13, IL-18, TNF-α, VILIP-1, TGF-α, and VEGF levels, indicating systemic inflammation and potential blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. β-NGF was increased in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, suggesting the activation of neuroprotective responses during patient recovery. Functional protein network analysis showed a significant enrichment of interactions between factors altered in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, many of them related to processes of neuroinflammation and microglial functions, and leukocyte chemotaxis, activation and proliferation. These findings support a model in which both systemic immune activation and localized neuroinflammation contribute to the diversity of neurological outcomes observed in COVID-19, and dysregulated cytokine production, glial activation, inflammasome activity and BBB disturbances represent key factors in neuro-COVID-19 pathogenesis.

        <tr id="The widespread prevalence of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by Echinococcus multilocularis infection poses a significant threat to human health. E. multilocularis is found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. Given the limitations of current treatment methods, primarily surgical resection, there is a pressing need for more effective therapeutic options. We established a mouse model of E. multilocularis infection by injecting E. multilocularis protoscoleces into C57BL/6 mice. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) following E. multilocularis infection was identified and validated using various techniques, including transcriptome sequencing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and flow cytometry. We found that the knockout of the Indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) gene or the administration of IDO1 inhibitors resulted in a decrease in the levels of NET-related molecules, including CitH3, MPO, PAD4, PR3, NE, and MPO–DNA complexes, as well as cfDNA. In addition, after the addition of the IDO1 inhibitor, the levels of p65, phospho-p65, p50/105, and REL increased. These results showed that IDO1 promotes the formation of NETs and inhibits NF-κB activation. Moreover, IDO1 inhibits AE progression by regulating NET formation. In conclusion, this study revealed that IDO1 inhibits AE progression by regulating NET formation, and this regulation may be associated with IDO1-induced neutrophil production and NF-κB signalling activation. These results are valuable for understanding the pathogenesis of E. multilocularis and may offer new insights for the prevention and treatment of AE.">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) caused by the fungus Candida albicans triggers a robust inflammatory response that rapidly eliminates the bulk of the fungal load in the oral mucosa. While pro-inflammatory responses to OPC have been extensively studied, little is known about the counterbalance of immunity in the infection milieu that mitigates inflammatory damage. We employed 10× Visium Spatial Transcriptomics, a next-generation technology that preserves the spatial integrity of infected tongue tissues, enabling high-resolution mapping of the host microenvironment during Candida infection in a murine OPC model. This approach provided a view of cellular interactions and immune dynamics, revealing intricate crosstalk between distinct immune cell populations. Our findings highlight a previously underappreciated role of the type-2 immune response and M2 macrophages in maintaining tissue homeostasis, and the predicted role of platelet degranulation in facilitating disease resolution. Finally, we identified a novel family of small proline-rich antimicrobial proteins with potent antifungal activity. These molecules emerge as promising therapeutic candidates, offering a new avenue for combating OPC. IMPORTANCE Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), a fungal infection caused by Candida albicans, affects individuals with weakened immune systems. Our study used spatial transcriptomics, a cutting-edge technology that preserves tissue architecture while mapping immune interactions at high resolution. This approach allowed us to uncover previously unrecognized cellular crosstalk and regulatory pathways that shape the host response to OPC. We discovered that platelets, beyond their role in clotting, play a key role in antifungal defense. Additionally, M2 macrophages are important for resistance to OPC. Most notably, we identified a new family of antimicrobial proteins with strong antifungal properties, presenting promising therapeutic potential. By uncovering these overlooked immune mechanisms, our research findings may lead to better treatments for OPC, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.

In this study, we utilized the classical model of experimental cerebral malaria (Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected C57BL/6 mice) to investigate the dynamics and response of resident brain cell populations, particularly microglia, and the influx of other leukocytes during the development of experimental cerebral malaria. By employing flow cytometry and established markers for different leukocyte populations, we were able to discern and document an increase in the number of Ly6C+ T cells (CD45hiCD11b-CD3+ cells), inflammatory monocytes (CD45hiCD11b+TMEM119-CD206- cells), resident macrophages (CD45hiCD11b+TMEM119-CD206+ cells), and microglia (CD45lowCD11b+ TMEM119+CD206- cells) following infection. Moreover, our ex vivo analysis demonstrated an increment in the overall number of inflammatory monocytes, resident macrophages and microglia expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in addition to those producing interleukin-1β or TNF. These findings highlight the pronounced reactivity of microglia in experimental cerebral malaria and provide valuable information on cell dynamics and immune responses in the brain.">

        <tr id="The long-term pulmonary sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections reflect infection severity, innate and adaptive immunity, and respiratory epithelial repair. This study investigated the acute and reparative responses as a function of age and sex in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures utilizing a 14-day SARS-CoV-2 infection protocol. SARS-CoV-2 infection peaked at 3 days post-infection (dpi) with an ~ 2 log titer suppression at 14 dpi. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced interferon, interferon-induced gene, and cell damage responses. No age- or sex-dependent effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected. Airway epithelia repaired to an abnormal mucus metaplastic/inflammatory state that reflected potentially beneficial and adverse consequences at 14 dpi. Repair processes were infection severity-dependent, not sex-dependent, and were more robust in young donor cultures. Analyses of long-COVID subjects with persistent pulmonary fibrosis or persistent bronchitic airway diseases exhibited expression of HBE 14 dpi failed repair gene signatures, including ISG gene signatures. Human airway epithelial repair post-SARS-CoV-2 is prolonged and incomplete in vitro over 14 days, and persistently abnormal repair may contribute to phenotypes of people with long-COVID pulmonary syndrome.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains a critical global health threat, with DENV-2 being the most virulent serotype capable of causing lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a severe complication characterized by plasma leakage and hemorrhagic manifestations. While the search for viral receptors and immunocompetent animal models has persisted since the first recorded outbreak in 1779, significant gaps remain. Here, we establish the first immunocompetent murine model of DHF with intact innate/adaptive immunity by generating hTim4-transgenic C57BL/6J mice. This model recapitulates fatal DHF complications seen in humans, including systemic hemorrhage, dengue encephalitis and intestinal ischemia/gangrene. Integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analysis of hemorrhagic gut lesions demonstrated that DENV-2 infection induces Syk protein overexpression, leading to enhanced Th2 cytokine secretion and impaired hemostatic regulation. This cascade enhances vascular permeability, promotes plasma leakage, and drives multiorgan hemorrhage, a mechanism corroborated by parallel analyses of human DHF tissues. Critically, Th2-biased cytokine storm mirrors clinical findings in severe human dengue cases. Our work not only identifies hTim4 as a functional DENV-2 receptor but also provides a mechanistically grounded platform for DHF pathogenesis studies, bridging critical gaps between preclinical models and human immunopathology.">

        <tr id="Background: Currently the role of dengue virus (DENV) specific T cell responses in disease pathogenesis and protection are not well understood, including potential differences in those who have obesity. We sought to investigate the functionality and phenotype of T cells in patients with acute dengue fever (DF) or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Methods: T cell function was assessed in patients with DF (n=50) and DHF (n=12), recruited within 4 days of illness and again on day 5 to 7, using 109 peptides representing CD8+ T cell epitopes and 90 peptides targeting CD4+ T cell epitopes. Phenotypic analysis was in DF (n=21) and DHF patients (n=21), recruited between days 6 to 8 since onset of illness, by multicolor flow cytometry. Results: The frequency of ex vivo IFN{gamma} ELISpot responses to both the CD4+ and CD8+ peptides pools significantly increased from the first to second time point in patients with DF (p<0.0001) but not with DHF. The frequency of ex vivo IFN{gamma} ELISpot responses to CD4+ (p=0.001) and CD8+ peptides pools (p=0.0002) also significantly increased from the first to second time point in lean patients compared obese patients. Cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen (CLA) expression was significantly higher in the CD8+ T cell subset in patients with DF and DHF compared to HC and these differences were most significant in CD8+CD45RA- T cells. CD8+CD45RA-CLA+ T cells consisted of >50% of the T cells in 9/21 patients with DHF, with 92.7% expressing CD38. CLA expression was highest in the CD8+CD45RA- of obese individuals, which was significantly higher compared to lean individuals (p=0.01). CD27 and CD127 were both significantly downregulated in patients with DHF compared to DF, with ICOS expression being significantly higher in CD8+ T cells in DHF. Discussion: Patients with DHF and obese individuals had impaired T cell functionality. Activated and skin homing CD8+ T cells were associated with DHF, with downregulation of CD27 and CD127. Therefore, the role of skin homing T cells, which have impaired functionality in disease pathogenesis, should be further investigated.">

        <tr id="The ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants highlights the importance of monitoring immune responses to guide vaccination strategies. Although neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) have garnered increasing attention, T-cells are crucial for conferring long-lasting immunity, especially their resilience against viral mutations. However, assessing T-cell responses clinically has been hindered by cost and complexity. In this study, we recruited a cohort of 134 healthy adults, who had been immunized with three doses of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine. Cellular immunity elicited by a comprehensive array of overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the virus’s structural proteins was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Additionally, a dataset including demographic information, routine blood indices, and immune cell indicators comprising 32 variables was collected. Multivariate analysis revealed age and days post-vaccination as key factors influencing the strength of the T-cell response. Importantly, random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were employed, along with 8 easily accessible indicators to formulate predictive models for the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Besides, these models demonstrated substantial accuracy (r > 0.9) in both the training and testing sets. Our findings offer an efficient and economical methodology for evaluating the T-cell reactions in healthy adults following inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, which is visualizable and easy to use, providing a novel strategy for assessing cellular immunity after vaccination.

        <tr id="Coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3) infection causes inflammatory conditions such as viral myocarditis and meningitis, and incidence rates are rising annually. While children are more likely to be affected by severe manifestations, the molecular basis of this age-dependent susceptibility is poorly understood. In this study, we used young Balb/c mice at three developmental stages (7-, 14-, and 30-day-old mice) to investigate CV-B3 pathogenesis. Our findings revealed that 7-day-old mice exhibited substantial infection susceptibility and pathological severity compared to older mice. Critically, an age-dependent analysis showed a progressive decline in the expression of CV-B3-binding Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) splice variants (CAR1 and CAR2) at both the transcriptional and translational levels as the mice matured from 7 to 30 days. These receptor isoforms demonstrated a direct correlation with viral replication efficiency in younger hosts. Concurrently, aging was associated with a rise in non-binding CAR variants (CAR3 and CAR4). During CV-B3 infection, the abundance of CAR1/CAR2 in young mice facilitated accelerated viral proliferation, coupled with the hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the expansion of IL-17-producing γδT cells (γδT17 cells). This cascade triggered excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-17), culminating in pronounced inflammatory infiltrates within cardiac and cerebral tissues. These findings establish NLRP3 inflammasome dysregulation as a critical determinant of CV-B3-induced tissue damage and provide novel insights into the heightened susceptibility to CV-B infection during early life and its associated severe disease rates.">

        <tr id="Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk for several pregnancy-related disorders, particularly preeclampsia (PE). However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function. Methods Placental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay. Results SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression. Discussion SARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.">

How SARS-CoV-2 contributes to vascular inflammation and whether epithelio-endothelial cross-talk is involved remain unclear. We investigated in detail the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the vasculature using 2D and 3D vesseloid in vitro models. We first assessed whether SARS-CoV-2 is able to directly infect endothelial cells. In the absence of ACE2 in endothelial cells, no productive infection was detected. Low uptake of viral particles by ACE2-overexpressing endothelial cells was observed without efficient viral production. Thus, the indirect effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection may involve epithelio-endothelial cell cross-talk. After infection of the epithelial cells, a significant inflammatory response was detected in the endothelial cells. CXCL10 was the most highly expressed proinflammatory cytokine involved in this intercellular communication, and its function was subsequently explored. Finally, the clinical relevance of our findings was confirmed in two patient cohorts.

        <tr id="Despite targeting mainly the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 disrupts T cell homeostasis in ways that may explain both acute lethality and long-term immunological consequences. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the T-cell-mediated chain of immunity and formation of TCR via TREC assessment in COVID-19 and long COVID (LC). For this study, we collected 231 blood samples taken from patients with acute COVID-19 (n = 71), convalescents (n = 51), people diagnosed with LC (n = 63), and healthy volunteers (n = 46). With flow cytometry, we assessed levels of CD4+ and CD8+ minor T cell subpopulations (i.e., naïve, central and effector memory cells (CM and EM), Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, Tc17.1, and subpopulations of effector cells (pE1, pE2, effector cells)). Additionally, we measured TREC levels. We found distinct changes in immune cell distribution—whilst distribution of major subpopulations of T cells was similar between cohorts, we noted that COVID-19 was associated with a decrease in naïve Th and CTLs, an increase in Th2/Tc2 lymphocyte polarization, an increase in CM cells, and a decrease in effector memory cells 1,3, and TEMRA cells. LC was associated with naïve CTL increase, polarization towards Th2 population, and a decrease in Tc1, Tc2, Em2, 3, 4 cells. We also noted TREC correlating with naïve cells subpopulations. Our findings suggest ongoing immune dysregulation, possibly driven by persistent antigen exposure or tissue migration of effector cells. The positive correlation between TREC levels and naïve T cells in LC patients points to residual thymic activity. The observed Th2/Th17 bias supports the hypothesis that LC involves autoimmune mechanisms, potentially driven by molecular mimicry or loss of immune tolerance.">

        <tr id="Non-biogenic nanoparticles (NPs), including silica and polystyrene, are major components of environmental particulate pollution and can accumulate in the brain, especially during development when the blood-brain barrier is immature, leading to neurotoxicity. However, protective responses within the brain to these NPs remain poorly understood. Here, using a developing mouse model, we show that microglia phagocytose non-biogenic NPs through a complement-dependent mechanism involving C3 tagging. This process is regulated by a chemokine cascade in which vascular endothelial cells release CCL17, activating CCR4 on perivascular astrocytes to promote astrocytic C3 production. Inhibition of CCR4 signaling suppresses C3 production, impairs microglial phagocytosis, increases neuronal loss, and exacerbates anxiety-like behaviors. Our data establish a protective role for the vascular–glial chemokine–complement axis in limiting neurotoxicity during brain development. These findings reveal a coordinated immune response to non-biogenic environmental NPs and uncover a vascular–glial mechanism that mitigates NP-induced brain injury.

        <tr id="Background Respiratory microbiome alterations, coinfections, and virus intrahost evolution are of great interest in persistently viable SARS-CoV-2 infections in the context of antiviral treatment and immune response. However, samples before, during, and after infection are seldom available to researchers. Therefore, there has been a significant lack of opportunities to comprehensively study microbiota homeostasis, coinfections, and virus intra-host evolution on the consensus and minor variants scale in response to antiviral treatments and patient immune response. Case presentation A 63-year-old female patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma received multiple treatments for SARS-CoV-2 that remained active 169 days. Together, 32 respiratory and 19 serum samples were collected before, during, and after (− 398 to 233 days) COVID-19. Subsets were selected for virus viability testing by culture (20) and subgenomic (sg) RNA (20) measurement, intra-host evolution assessment (18), microbiome composition analysis (28), and coinfection identification (11). IgA/IgG and neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured 19 times throughout the infection. SARSCoV-2 lineage XBB.1.16.11 persisted and remained viable until 116 days post infection (PI) regardless of treatments. No sgRNA marker tested was suitable for virus viability prediction. IgG/IgA antibodies first appeared after 38 days, but the virus persisted regardless of multiple plasma treatments before neutralizing antibodies appeared (100 days PI) and finally cleared the virus 116 days PI. Consensus-level mutations fluctuated around 102.7 ± 4.0, and minor variants increased from six to 61 with a mutation rate of 4.9 × 10−3 per site per year, with the highest average number of mutations per gene length in S and E (0.013) with surges after every antiviral treatment. The transversion/transition ratio increased from 0.50 (day 0) to 0.57 (day 24) with a steady decrease to 0.48 (day 147). Mutational signature analysis showed dominance of C > T substitutions consistent with APOBEC antiviral enzyme activity. Upper respiratory microbiota showed three distinct profiles with varying α-/β-diversity and an association of Staphylococcus spp. with COVID-19. Conclusions These findings further elucidate the dynamics of intra-host viral evolution and complexities of virus clearance in individuals with hematological malignancies and highlight the impact of antiviral treatments on the potential of virus variants emergence in longitudinally infectious patients due to delayed immune response.

        <tr id="Following infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients may experience with one or more symptoms that appear or persist over time. Neurological symptoms associated with long COVID include anxiety, depression, and memory impairment. However, the exact underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Using golden hamsters as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persistently infect the brain, as viral RNA and replicative virus are detected in the brainstem 80 days after the initial infection. Infected hamsters exhibit a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, characterized by overexpression of innate immunity genes, and altered expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, in energy metabolism, and in proteostasis. These infected animals exhibit persistent depression-like behavior, impaired short-term memory, and late-onset signs of anxiety. Finally, we provide evidence that viral and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, contributing to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a rapidly progressive and severe gastrointestinal disorder in neonates that is marked by an inflammatory cascade initiated by mechanisms that remain incompletely understood, resulting in intestinal necrosis and systemic infections. This study demonstrated that itaconate (ITA) exerts a protective effect in NEC by regulating macrophage reprogramming. Methods Changes in ITA expression were investigated using immunofluorescence staining and liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry, and their effect on immune cell differentiation was verified through single‐cell sequencing. In vivo experiments were performed using ACOD1 −/‐ and ACOD1fl/flLysMcre NEC mouse models. Results We detected changes in ITA expression in clinical NEC samples and confirmed the effect of these changes on immune cell differentiation. In vivo experiments confirmed the therapeutic role of ITA in regulating macrophage differentiation in NEC, and we further investigated the mechanism by which ITA regulates macrophage metabolic reprogramming. The depletion of ITA in NEC correlates with an increased frequency of pro‐inflammatory macrophage polarization, thereby exacerbating intestinal inflammatory injury. Importantly, our in vivo experiments revealed that treatment with 4‐octyl itaconate (4OI) significantly mitigated intestinal symptoms associated with NEC in murine models. Mechanistic investigations showed that 4OI effectively suppressed M1 macrophage polarization by rescuing mitochondrial function and upregulating oxidative phosphorylation in macrophages. Conclusions Our results highlight ITA as a metabolic checkpoint of macrophage differentiation in NEC and suggest the therapeutic efficacy of 4OI in NEC. Key points Itaconate alleviates NEC by reprogramming M1 macrophage metabolism ACOD1 deficiency exacerbates NEC severity 4OI maintains intestinal barrier integrity. 4OI rescues NEC by regulating macrophage mitochondrial activity.">

        <tr id="Both bacterial and viral infections can trigger an overwhelming host response, leading to immunopathology and organ dysfunction. Multiple studies have reported dysregulated myeloid cell states in patients with bacterial sepsis or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their relevance to viral infections other than COVID-19, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a multi-cohort analysis of single cell and bulk transcriptomic data from 1845 patients across 25 studies. Our meta-analysis revealed a conserved severity-associated gene signature pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM) and increased IL1R2 expression in monocytes and neutrophils from patients with bacterial sepsis, COVID-19, and influenza. Analysis of tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients showed that IL-6 signaling blockade partially reduces this signature and results in a compensatory increase in G-CSF. To validate the role of these cytokines in vivo, we used a mouse model of influenza infection that recapitulates severity-associated increases in IL1R2+ monocytes and IL1R2hi neutrophils, and demonstrate that combined IL-6 and G-CSF blockade inhibits their production. Our study demonstrates the cooperative role of G-CSF and IL-6 in driving the production of severity-associated IL1R2+ myeloid cells and highlights the link between myeloid dysregulation and tissue injury during severe infection.">

        <tr id="Excessive pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia is a critical driver of secondary inflammation following spinal cord injury (SCI). Jaceosidin, a natural flavonoid with established anti-inflammatory properties, has not been extensively studied in the context of post-SCI inflammation regulation. Given the fundamental role of glycolysis in cellular energy metabolism and its crucial involvement in inflammatory processes, this study investigated the effects of Jaceosidin. We demonstrated that Jaceosidin significantly attenuated the inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia in vitro. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that Jaceosidin shifted microglial polarization away from the inflammatory state and suppressed glycolytic flux. Mechanistically, Jaceosidin directly targeted and inhibited the activity of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key glycolytic enzyme. Intervention with Jaceosidin in a mouse SCI model resulted in reduced microglial activation at the injury site, diminished tissue damage, and significantly improved motor and autonomic nerve function recovery. In conclusion, our findings indicate that Jaceosidin mitigates microglial inflammation and promotes functional recovery after SCI by inhibiting PKM2 activity and dampening glycolysis. As a natural phytochemical derived from traditional Chinese medicine, Jaceosidin presents a promising novel therapeutic strategy for the clinical management of spinal cord injury.">

        <tr id="Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a systemic disease caused by mutations in either the TSC1 (encoding hamartin) or TSC2 (encoding tuberin) gene, with mutations in the TSC2 gene potentially leading to more severe clinical symptoms. Neurological symptoms are a common clinical manifestation of TSC, and neuroinflammation is thought to play an important role. Glial cells are a major source of neuroinflammation, but whether microglia are involved in the activation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in TSC patients remains unclear. We used a transcriptome sequencing dataset for bioinformatics analysis to explore the differences in the expression of microglial inflammasome-associated hub genes. TSC2 knockdown (TSC2 KD) microglia (HMC3 cell line) were generated by lentivirus, and the expression of inflammasome-associated hub genes, microglial activation, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were verified. In addition, experiments were performed to explore the regulatory effects of rapamycin. Bioinformatics analysis identified a total of eight inflammasome-associated hub genes. By detecting GFP fluorescence, TSC2 mRNA, TSC2 protein expression, and the phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR)/mTOR, we confirmed that the TSC2 KD microglia model was successfully established. Compared with the control group, the TSC2 KD group presented higher mRNA levels and fluorescence intensities of microglia AIF1 and CD68, as well as greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Eight inflammasome-associated hub gene mRNA assays revealed that the expression of the NLRP3 and IL1B genes was increased. Compared with the control group, the TSC2 KD group presented increased levels of NLRP3 and Pro-IL-1β proteins in cells and Cleaved-Caspase 1 and Cleaved-IL-1β proteins in the supernatant, suggesting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Rapamycin intervention alleviated these changes, demonstrating that the TSC2 gene regulation of microglial activation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are correlated with mTOR phosphorylation. In conclusion, microglia are activated in TSC patients and participate in the NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuroinflammatory response, and rapamycin treatment can alleviate these changes.">

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) can infect a wide range of animal species, including swine and rodents. Infection in pigs is associated with significant economic losses in the global pork industry and is characterized by acute, often fatal disease, as well as central nervous system (CNS) invasion, which leads to neurological manifestations. Although PRV replication has been extensively characterized in certain murine neuronal cell lines such as Neuro-2a, the mechanisms underlying PRV-induced neuroinflammatory injury and necroptosis remain largely unclear. In this study, Kunming mice and mouse astrocytes (C8-D1A) were infected with PRV-GXLB-2013 at different doses to evaluate neurological injury and inflammatory responses. Given that the NF-κB/MLKL signaling pathway was found to be activated during PRV infection, a selective MLKL inhibitor, necrosulfonamide (NSA), was applied to investigate the role of necroptosis in PRV-induced neuroinflammatory damage. Mice infected with higher viral doses showed increased mortality, severe neurological symptoms, elevated brain inflammation, and pathological changes. In C8-D1A cells, PRV infection significantly upregulated inflammatory cytokines and key components of the NF-κB/MLKL pathway. Importantly, NSA treatment markedly reduced these inflammatory responses, mitochondrial damage, and cellular necrosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that PRV infection triggers neuroinflammatory injury through the activation of necroptosis and the NF-κB/MLKL signaling pathway. This study provides novel mechanistic insights into PRV-induced neurological damage and highlights potential therapeutic targets for intervention.">

        <tr id="Background: In just twenty years, three dangerous human coronaviruses—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have exposed critical gaps in early detection of emerging viral threats. Current diagnostics remain pathogen-focused, often missing the earliest phase of infection. A virus-agnostic, host-based diagnostic capable of detecting responses to viral intrusion is urgently needed. Methods: We hypothesized that the lungs act as biomechanical instruments, with infection altering tissue tension, wave propagation, and flow dynamics in ways detectable through subaudible vibroacoustic signals. In a matched case–control study, we enrolled 19 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls across two Johns Hopkins hospitals. Multimodal data were collected, including passive vibroacoustic auscultation, lung ultrasound, peak expiratory flow, and laboratory markers. Machine learning models were trained to identify host-response biosignatures from anterior chest recordings. Results: 19 COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls (mean BMI 32.4 kg/m2, mean age 48.6 years) were successfully enrolled to the study. The top-performing, unoptimized, vibroacoustic-only model achieved an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.67–0.92). The host-covariate optimized model achieved an AUC of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.94–1.0), with 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 82–100%) and 99.6% specificity (95% CI: 85–100%). Vibroacoustic data from the anterior chest alone reliably distinguished COVID-19 cases from controls. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that passive, noninvasive vibroacoustic biosignatures can detect host response to viral infection in a hospitalized population and supports further testing of this modality in broader populations. These findings support the development of scalable, host-based diagnostics to enable early, agnostic detection of future pandemic threats (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04556149).">

Despite these reports, we observed partial lethality in STAT-1−/− mice following challenge with wild-type MACV. Serial sampling studies to evaluate the temporal progression of infection and pathologic changes after challenge revealed a two-phase disease course. The first phase was characterized by viral load and pathological lesions in the spleen, liver, and kidney followed by a second, lethal phase, defined by high viral titers and inflammation in the brain and spinal cord resulting in neurological manifestations and subsequent mortality. Tissue adaptation in the brains of challenged STAT-1−/− mice resulted in a fully lethal model in STAT-1−/− mice (mouse-adapted; maMACV). A similar two-phase disease course was observed following maMACV challenge, but more rapid dissemination of the virus to the brain and overall pathology in this region was observed.

        <tr id="Introduction Malaria remains a significant public health challenge in Brazil, where Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is the predominant species. Dysregulated immune responses contribute substantially to malaria pathogenesis. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) mediates the catabolism of tryptophan (TRP) into kynurenine (KYN), an immunosuppressive metabolite implicated in immune tolerance. This study aimed to investigate the role of TRP catabolism and regulatory T cells (Tregs) during P. vivax infection. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated in vitro with P. vivax-infected erythrocyte (Pv-iE) lysate to assess IDO-1 expression, KYN/TRP ratio, cytokine production, and Treg frequency. The effects of pharmacological inhibition of IDO, MyD88, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathways were evaluated. Additionally, plasma KYN/TRP ratio, Treg frequencies, and cytokine levels were measured in patients with acute P. vivax infection and compared between individuals experiencing their first malaria episode and those with previous infections. Results Stimulation with Pv-iE lysate increased IDO-1 expression in CD14+ cells, elevated KYN/TRP ratio, and induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. IDO inhibition reduced KYN/TRP ratio and Treg frequencies upon Pv-iE stimulation. MyD88 inhibition decreased both IDO-1 expression and KYN/TRP ratio. IDO and AhR inhibition reduced Treg frequencies and CD4+ T cell proliferation. Patients with acute P. vivax malaria exhibited elevated KYN/TRP ratios and increased Treg frequencies, with a positive correlation between these parameters. Individuals with prior malaria episodes showed lower Treg frequencies, plasma IFN-γ, and KYN/TRP ratios compared to those with primary infections. Discussion These findings highlight the role of IDO-mediated TRP catabolism and innate immune signaling in promoting a tolerogenic phenotype during P. vivax infection. The study provides novel insights into mechanisms that may contribute to immune regulation, chronic inflammation, and tolerance during malaria, with potential implications for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Introduction Severe COVID-19 is characterized by immune dysregulation, with T cells playing a central role in disease progression and recovery. However, the longitudinal dynamics of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire during the course of severe illness remain unclear. Methods To investigate temporal changes in adaptive immunity, we analyzed peripheral blood samples from the ICU-admitted severe COVID-19 patients (n = 36) collected at three time points: Day 1 (T1), Day 4 (T2), and Day 7 (T3). Bulk RNA-sequencing was performed to extract TCR repertoires, and cytokine profiles were assessed in parallel. TCR clonotypes were annotated using VDJdb and TCRex to infer potential epitope specificities. Results By T3, we observed a 2.3-fold expansion in TCR clonotypes along with increased TCR-β (TRB) chain usage, indicating the emergence of a broad polyclonal T cell response. In contrast, TCR-γ (TRG) chain prevalence declined. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-6, were reduced over time, marking a shift toward immune resolution. Changes in CDR3 motifs and preferential TRBV gene segment usage were detected, suggesting repertoire adaptation. Additionally, annotated TCR clonotypes at T3 mapped to SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogen-associated epitopes (e.g., CMV, Plasmodium), reflecting possible cross-reactivity or memory T cell recruitment. Discussion These findings suggest a coordinated transition from immune dysfunction to recovery in severe COVID-19, marked by expanding TCR diversity, reduced inflammation, and predicted broadening of antigen recognition. The integrated analysis of TCR repertoire dynamics and cytokine profiles provides insights into the adaptive immune mechanisms underlying viral clearance and immune stabilization.">

        <tr id="Severe sepsis can escalate to acute lung injury (ALI), a critical condition with limited treatment options. Emerging research highlights the role of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), in regulating epithelial and immune cell responses in sepsis-induced ALI. This study delves into the circAGFG1/miR-195-5p/PD-L1 axis to elucidate its potential in this context. The conducted experiments using Th17 cells differentiated from CD4+ T cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood, co-cultured with transfected Calu-3 cells. The assessed cell viability, RNA, and protein expression levels under inflammatory stimuli. In addition, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues from a cecal ligation and puncture mouse model. Quantification of RNA and protein expression of inflammatory and survival markers provided insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved. Peripheral blood samples from sepsis/ALI patients and healthy controls revealed that circAGFG1 expression is significantly downregulated, while miR-195-5p expression is upregulated in patients compared to healthy individuals. In both Calu-3 cells and induced Th17 cells, as well as in sepsis-induced ALI mouse models, the circAGFG1/miR-195-5p/PD-L1 axis was shown to regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines, Th17 cell differentiation, and markers of epithelial cell survival. Results show the circAGFG1/miR-195-5p/PD-L1 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. Targeting this axis could present a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing ALI in sepsis and other conditions characterized by heightened lung inflammation. This research paves the way for new treatment approaches, offering hope for improved outcomes in patients suffering from severe sepsis and ALI.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aims Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Substantial evidence implicates a central role for CD4+ T cells in MS pathogenesis, particularly IFN‐γ+ Th1 cells and IL‐17+ Th17 cells. NF‐κB plays an essential role in regulating the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, which typically mediate inflammatory responses as self‐triggers. QNZ is a highly selective inhibitor of NF‐κB transcriptional activation. In this study, we assessed the impact of QNZ on CD4+ T‐cell polarization in MS. Utilizing the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, we investigated these aspects of MS. Method EAE was induced in C57BL/6 female mice by active immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35–55 peptide. QNZ was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) once every 2 days after the first immunization. Disease severity was clinically assessed and histopathologically assessed in the CNS. Phenotyping of CD4+ T cells was performed by flow cytometry in the spleen and cervical lymph nodes. Results Prophylactic administration of QNZ to EAE mice suppressed the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells and demyelination within the spinal cord. Notably, QNZ also reduced the proportion of IFN‐γ+IL‐17+ Th17.1 cells, potentially playing a critical role in MS pathogenesis. Conclusions Quinazoline derivative QNZ could suppress neuroinflammation, alleviate the progression of EAE and be associated with reduced Th1 and Th17 immunity.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neonates have increased vulnerability to life-threatening infections due to the distinct immune landscape. Interleukin (IL)-27 is a key component of this immune profile that we have previously shown to be elevated in both newborn humans and mice. IL-27 continues to increase in the serum and tissues consistent with poor outcomes during gram-negative neonatal bacterial sepsis. Presently, we dissected the IL-27 producer profile at a single-cell level using IL-27p28eGFP reporter mice in our previously established model of neonatal sepsis with luciferase-expressing K1-encapsulated Escherichia coli. Whole animal imaging regionally highlighted the spleen, liver, and lungs as key infection sites by bacterial luminescence. Flow cytometry showed that IL-27 producers increased significantly in the liver with infection and were predominantly F4/80+ and CD11b+ with subpopulations that emerged expressing additional markers. This information paired with single-cell RNA sequencing further identified the most robust populations as monocytes, monocyte-derived cells, and Kupffer cells followed by smaller populations of dendritic cells and neutrophils. The transcriptome demonstrated a diverse range of functionality amongst populations that included differential expression of genes implicated in bactericidal, metabolic, and inflammatory changes. Collectively, the transcriptome of IL-27 producers from the livers of infected animals suggests an uncoordinated mix of inflammatory and suppressive activity that may contribute to immune dysregulation characteristic of sepsis. Together, this work provides previously undescribed insight into the details of IL-27 producers during early-life infection. This further provides essential information needed to support IL-27 as a therapeutic target for neonatal bacterial sepsis.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause skeletal muscle, myocardial, and gastrointestinal lesions. However, it is currently unclear whether these lesions are caused directly by viral infection or indirectly after infection and whether there are differences between different animal models. Here, we first compared the pathological changes of skeletal muscle, myocardium, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle of different COVID-19 animal models (rhesus monkey, hamster, ferret, hACE2 transgenic mice, hACE2-K18 transgenic mice, mink, and cat), and analyzed the possible mechanism of pathological changes. Within 5-7 days of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, the three types of muscles in these models were all damaged and inflammatory response to varying degrees, and infiltrating inflammatory cells and factors mainly included CD4T, CD8T cells, macrophages, a small amount of B cells, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, and so on. Among them, the pathological changes of the three muscle tissues in the rhesus monkey model were the most significant and closely related to clinical manifestations. It was determined that SARS-CoV-2 can infect these three types of muscles through in situ hybridization and electron microscopy analysis. Therefore, the performance of muscle lesions in each model was not completely consistent and may be related to multiple factors after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including animal species, direct virus invasion, systemic inflammation after infection, and immune status of the body. This study provides a foundation for selecting models to study muscle lesion mechanisms and treatment strategies, highlighting the need for clinical attention to muscle tissue involvement in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The pathology of Parkinson’s disease is defined by α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation into neuronal Lewy bodies, which may lead to chronic neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Misfolded α-syn activates Toll-like receptor signaling in microglia, leading to downstream activation of NF-κB and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines recruit pro-inflammatory myeloid cells from circulation, thereby amplifying neuroinflammation. Thus, reducing microglial activation and myeloid cell infiltration has the potential to reduce neuroinflammation and PD pathology. Here, we investigated a targeted immunomodulatory strategy using LA1, a novel, small-molecule agonist of CD11b, a β2 integrin receptor highly and selectively expressed on myeloid cells and microglia. CD11b has key roles in cell adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis. Previous work has demonstrated that CD11b agonism via LA1 transiently enhances integrin-mediated adhesion that limits immune cell transmigration and tissue infiltration. CD11b agonism also suppresses TLR-driven inflammatory signaling and myeloid cell activation. To evaluate its efficacy in vivo , we utilized pre-clinical Parkinson’s disease model by stereotaxically delivering AAV2-SYN to induce α-synuclein overexpression in the murine midbrain. Mice were treated with oral LA1 for four or eight weeks and analyzed. LA1 treatment significantly reduced microglial activation and decreased brain infiltration of peripheral immune cells, thereby attenuating α-synuclein-induced neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that CD11b agonism may offer a dual-action therapeutic approach in Parkinson’s disease by dampening pro-inflammatory responses by central and peripheral myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Viral and bacterial lung infections place a significant burden on public health. Versican, an extracellular matrix (ECM) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, coordinates the innate immune response in multiple experimental models. Versican’s potential as an immunomodulatory molecule makes it a promising therapeutic target for controlling the host’s immune response to lung infection. However, versican’s contribution to lung inflammation, injury, and immune cell activity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a critical knowledge gap. To address our central hypothesis that mesenchymal-derived versican is pro-inflammatory and enhances the innate immune response to IAV infection, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse deficient in mesenchymal-derived versican (B6. Col1a2-CreERT+/−/Vcantm1.1Cwf, Col1a2/Vcan−/−). We report that mesenchymal-derived versican plays a critical role in neutrophil, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration into the lungs and airways early in IAV infection. Intriguingly, mesenchymal-derived versican deficiency had the most substantial negative impact on neutrophil emigration into the lungs. We found that neutrophils were less adhesive to the ECM of Col1a2/Vcan−/− mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs), which had a significant decrease in versican compared to wild-type mLFs. Additionally, Col1a2/Vcan−/− mLFs treated with poly(I:C) in vitro have reduced cell-associated hyaluronan. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived versican is necessary for adhesion to lung fibroblasts by neutrophils as they transit into the lung interstitium and airways from the pulmonary vasculature. Our findings demonstrate that mesenchymal-derived versican is a key regulator of the early host immune responses to IAV.">

However, current disease-modifying therapies demonstrate limited efficacy in addressing progressive disease subtypes, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we systematically review the neuroimmune interactions underlying the pathogenesis of MS, with a focus on three key aspects: the immune niche, immune cell types, and cell-based therapies. We first discuss the evolution of brain-immune concepts, from early notions of immune privilege to modern understandings of brain-border immune niches (meninges, choroid plexus, and perivascular spaces). These compartments serve as critical interfaces where peripheral immune cells interact with CNS-resident immune cells. We then analyze the roles of specific immune cell subsets (e.g., T/B cells, myeloid cells and microglia) in disease progression, highlighting their functional heterogeneity across different MS subtypes. Furthermore, we highlight emerging MS immunotherapies-including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T regimens, mesenchymal stem cell interventions, microbiome modulation, and nanodelivery systems, which strategically target mechanistic nodes spanning neuroimmune niche regulation, inflammatory cascade blockade, and CNS neurorestorative capacities.">

        <tr id="Background The global circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has led to an increasing number of reinfections, raising concerns about their clinical and immune consequences. Understanding the differences in disease severity, vaccination impact, and immune response between primary infections and reinfections is essential for guiding public health strategies. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 2023 to June 2024. SARS-CoV-2 reinfection cases were matched 1:2 with primary infection cases using nearest neighbor propensity score matching (PSM) to balance age, sex, and comorbidities between the groups. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, serum antibody levels, lymphocyte subsets, and the impact of vaccination on disease severity were analyzed. Results A total of 907 patients were included, comprising 821 with primary infection and 86 with reinfection. After matching, 131 cases remained in the primary infection group and 75 in the reinfection group. No significant differences were observed in disease severity, mortality, or most clinical symptoms. Trend analysis revealed that an increasing number of vaccine doses was significantly associated with a decreasing trend in severe disease in both the primary infection group (P = 0.0221) and the reinfection group (P = 0.0449). IgG levels were significantly higher in reinfected patients (P < 0.001), whereas IgM levels showed no significant difference (P = 0.474). Among patients with primary infection, severe cases exhibited lower T cell counts than non-severe cases (P < 0.001), but no significant differences in T cell subsets were observed between non-severe and severe reinfections. Conclusions The higher IgG levels in reinfected individuals suggest a robust immune memory response, while T cell depletion plays a crucial role in severe primary infections. Vaccination provided a protective effect against severe disease in both primary and reinfected individuals, with a significant decreasing trend in severe/critical cases as the number of vaccine doses increased.

        <tr id="Microglia are the first responders to insults or damages in the brain where they display both beneficial and detrimental effects. Excessively activated microglia aggravate the secondary damage by producing several proinflammatory mediators. Voltage-gated proton channels, Hv1 are selectively expressed in the microglia where they modulate microglial activation. Therefore, Hv1 has emerged as a tractable target for treating a number of conditions, ranging from pain, neurological disorders to cancer. Due to the absence of a suitable Hv1 inhibitor, the pathophysiological roles of Hv1 channels has been exemplified using preclinical Hv1 knockout (KO) mice models. Thus, we characterized and validated the microglial Hv1 channel’s functions using the recently reported Hv1 inhibitor (YHV98-4) and a novel Hv1 activator (S-023-0515) in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. In LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells, treatment with YHV98-4 alleviated the proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS. Direct activation of Hv1 channels using S-023-0515 resulted in an increase in microglial M1 like polarisation, proinflammatory mediators, phagocytic capacity and mitochondrial ROS levels but did not alter the cellular ROS production. Analysis of the signalling pathway indicated that YHV98-4 and S-023-0515 exerted their protective and deleterious effects, respectively via phosphorylation of NF-κΒ, which serves as an upstream regulator of the inflammatory cascade. Collectively, our results elucidate the essential role of Hv1 channels in microglial functions and also demonstrate that their pharmacological inhibition and activation during inflammatory conditions are neuroprotective or neurotoxic, respectively.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a wide range of acute and chronic disease manifestations. While most infections are mild, a significant number of patients develop severe illness marked by respiratory failure, thromboinflammation, and multi-organ dysfunction. In addition, post-acute sequelae—commonly known as long-COVID—can persist for months. Recent studies have identified the emergence of diverse autoantibodies in COVID-19, including those targeting nuclear antigens, phospholipids, type I interferons, cytokines, endothelial components, and G-protein-coupled receptors. These autoantibodies are more frequently detected in patients with moderate to severe disease and have been implicated in immune dysregulation, vascular injury, and persistent symptoms. This review examines the underlying immunological mechanisms driving autoantibody production during SARS-CoV-2 infection—including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, and bystander activation—and discusses their functional roles in acute and post-acute disease. We further explore the relevance of autoantibodies in maternal–fetal immunity and comorbid conditions such as autoimmunity and cancer, and we summarize current and emerging therapeutic strategies. A comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced autoantibodies may improve risk stratification, inform clinical management, and guide the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies.">

        <tr id="Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a cascade of neuroinflammatory responses mediated by microglial activation, which significantly contributes to secondary brain damage. While triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a key inflammatory amplifier, its mechanistic role and therapeutic potential in TBI remain elusive. Thus, this study endeavored to elucidate the exact role of TREM-1 in experimental TBI. Methods A controlled cortical impact (CCI) model was established in male C57BL/6 mice to induce TBI. The temporal expression profile of TREM-1 was assessed using RNA sequencing and Western blot (WB). The TREM-1 inhibitory peptide LP17 was administered intranasally at 2 hours post-injury (hpi). Neurobehavioral assessments, histological analyses, immunofluorescence (IF), brain water content (BWC) measurement, Evans blue (EB) assays and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) were performed in this study. In vitro experiments using BV2 microglial cells were conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying TREM-1-mediated inflammation. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibition was achieved using R406, and TREM-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpressing plasmids were performed to validate its role in NF-κB signaling and pyroptosis quantified using WB and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SD, and group comparisons were made by two-tailed Student’s t-tests or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results TBI significantly upregulated TREM-1 expression in microglia, peaking at 3 days post-injury (dpi). Intranasal administration of the TREM-1 antagonist LP17 treatment attenuated neuroinflammation, reduced blood-brain barrier disruption, ameliorated cerebral blood flow decrease, promoted synaptic remodeling, and improved functional outcomes. Mechanistically, through its interaction with SYK, TREM-1 triggered the CARD9/NF-κB signaling and induced pyroptosis. SYK inhibition reversed these effects, confirming the necessity of the TREM-1/SYK axis in neuroinflammatory signaling. In vitro studies further demonstrated that TREM-1 overexpression enhanced SYK phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and pyroptosis, while LP17 or R406 treatment suppressed these responses. Conclusion Our finding demonstrates that TREM-1 critically mediates neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction after TBI. Pharmacological targeting of TREM-1 attenuates neuroinflammation, reduces cerebral edema, preserves blood-brain barrier integrity, and improves functional recovery. These effects are mediated through suppression of TREM-1-dependent NF-κB signaling and pyroptosis. These results highlight TREM-1 as a promising therapeutic target for TBI.">

        <tr id="With the rise in immunocompromised individuals and patients with immune-related comorbidities such as COVID-19, the rate of fungal infections is growing. This increase, along with the current plateau in antifungal drug development, has made understanding the pathogenesis and dissemination of these organisms more pertinent than ever. The mouse model of fungal infection, while informative on a basic scientific level, has severe limitations in terms of translation to the human disease. Here we present data supporting the implementation of the human cerebral organoid model, which is generated from human embryonic stem cells and accurately recapitulates relevant brain cell types and structures, to study fungal infection and dissemination to the central nervous system (CNS). This approach provides direct insight into the relevant pathogenesis of specific fungal organisms in human tissues where in vivo models are impossible. With this model system we assessed the specific brain tropisms and cellular effects of fungal pathogens known to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), such as Cryptococcus neoformans. We determined the effects of this fungal pathogen on the overall gross morphology, cellular architecture, and cytokine release from these model organoids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that C. neoformans penetrates and invades the organoid tissue and remains present throughout the course of infection. These results demonstrate the utility of this new model to the field and highlight the potential for this system to elucidate fungal pathogenesis to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat the disseminated stages of fungal diseases such as cryptococcal meningitis.">

        <tr id="Background. Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, but efforts to develop efficacious neuroprotective therapy face ongoing challenges. Efferocytosis, the phagocytic clearance of dying cells, by microglia is crucial for limiting neuroinflammation and promoting stroke resolution. Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is an inflammatory mediator which impairs macrophage bacterial phagocytosis in sepsis and radiation injury, but its role in microglial efferocytosis in ischemic stroke has not yet been studied. Results. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model of ischemic stroke, we demonstrate that eCIRP is released into the cerebrospinal fluid and microglial expression of crucial efferocytic receptor MerTK decreases in tMCAO mice. CIRP deficiency significantly improved neurological deficit, MerTK expression and microglial efferocytosis in tMCAO mice. Utilizing tMCAO, hippocampal injections, and primary microglia, we show that eCIRP induces pro-inflammatory micro-RNA 155 (miR-155) via TLR4, which suppresses its target pro-efferocytic transcription factor MAF bZIP (MafB), downregulating MerTK and microglial efferocytosis. Pharmacological blockade of eCIRP–TLR4 interaction using small peptide C23 attenuates miR-155 induction, restores MerTK expression, rescues microglial efferocytosis, and improves outcomes in tMCAO mice. Conclusion. We show that eCIRP causes microglial efferocytic dysfunction in ischemic stroke via TLR4/miR-155/MafB axis. These findings uncover a previously unknown pathway through which eCIRP signaling impairs neuroprotective function in microglia and suggest that targeting eCIRP may promote functional recovery after stroke.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Inflammation, and particularly microglial cells, has become a central feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology. The transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a calcium‐permeable nonselective channel involved in the pathological mechanism of several inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of TRPM2 in inflammation and microglial activation in the context of PD remains unclear. Here, we combined both in vivo and in vitro PD models to investigate that question. Male and female TRPM2 partial and complete knockout mice were submitted to the 6‐hydroxidopamine mouse model of PD. We assessed microglia and lysosome‐associated protein (CD68) density levels, microglial morphology and cluster classification, CD68 area in individual microglial cells, and the protein levels of six different cytokines in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the striatum. Our results indicate that TRPM2 deletion reduced microglial density, rescued its morphology, decreased CD68 staining area within microglia, and lowered pro‐inflammatory cytokines levels in both male and female mice. To better understand TRPM2 involvement in PD pathology, we selectively knocked‐down TRPM2 in neurons, microglia, or both cells in a human neuron–microglia co‐culture PD model. An improvement in cell viability and a decrease in cell death were observed across the different experimental approaches. Lastly, TRPM2 deletion revealed reduced microglial phagocytosis and decreased expression of inflammation‐related molecules. For the first time, we demonstrated that TRPM2 is a critical mediator of microglial function in the context of PD. Thus, this study suggests that TRPM2 inhibition may offer a novel therapeutic target for PD modification.">

        <tr id="Abstract Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, are marked by systemic inflammation, T-cell exhaustion, lymphopenia, and chronic immune dysfunction, with limited therapeutic options for recovery. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a naturally occurring feline coronavirus infection, mirrors these immune pathologies, providing a valuable translational model. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapy combined with antiviral treatment in cats with effusive FIP. Hematologic, virologic, and immunologic analyses were conducted over 12 weeks. Antiviral therapy reduced cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion by downregulating inhibitory receptors PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3. MSC-treated cats demonstrated enhanced immune recovery, evidenced by reduced expression of exhaustion-related transcription factors (IKZF2, ZEB2, PRDM1) and increased regulatory T-cell populations, promoting immune homeostasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of mesenteric lymph nodes revealed transcriptomic shifts indicative of immune rejuvenation, including elevated memory T-cell markers (IKZF1, GZMK, IL7R) and reduced hyperproliferative lymphocyte subsets. Serum cytokine analysis revealed 3 distinct inflammatory mediator patterns using principal component analysis. Both treatment groups showed transitions toward cytokine profiles resembling those of healthy controls. Notably, residual cytokine elevations persisted at the study’s end, mirroring features of chronic immune dysregulation. PDGF-bb, a marker of tissue repair, was uniquely associated with higher lymphocyte counts, suggesting its role in lymphoid recovery. This study highlights the potential of MSC therapy to modulate immune dysfunction and support durable immune recovery. The findings underscore its translational relevance for addressing severe viral diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, advancing both veterinary and human medicine.">

        <tr id="Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to pathogenesis. Viral infections are potential environmental triggers that influence PD pathology. Using ViroFind, an unbiased platform for whole virome sequencing, along with quantitative PCR (qPCR), we identified human pegivirus (HPgV) in 5 of 10 (50%) of PD brains, confirmed by IHC in 2 of 2 cases, suggesting an association with PD. All 14 age- and sex-matched controls were HPgV negative. HPgV-brain positive patients with PD showed increased neuropathology by Braak stage and Complexin-2 levels, while those positive in the blood had higher IGF-1 and lower pS65-ubiquitin, supporting disruption in metabolism or mitophagy in response to HPgV. RNA-Seq revealed altered immune signaling in HPgV-infected PD samples, including consistent suppression of IL-4 signaling in both the brain and blood. Longitudinal analysis of blood samples showed a genotype-dependent viral response, with HPgV titers correlating directly with IL-4 signaling in a LRRK2 genotype–dependent manner. YWHAB was a key hub gene in the LRRK2 genotypic response, which exhibited an altered relationship with immune-related factors, including NFKB1, ITPR2, and LRRK2 itself, in patients with PD who are positive for HPgV. These results suggest a role for HPgV in shaping PD pathology and highlight the complex interplay between viral infection, immunity, and neuropathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation driven by microglial activation and α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregation is one of the central features driving Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis. GM1 ganglioside’s oligosaccharide moiety (OligoGM1) has shown neuroprotective potential in PD neuronal models, but its direct effects on inflammation remain poorly defined. This study investigated the ability of OligoGM1 to modulate microglial activation and αSyn handling in a human in vitro model. Human embryonic microglial (HMC3) cells were exposed to αSyn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) in the presence or absence of OligoGM1. Microglial activation markers, intracellular αSyn accumulation, and cytokine release were assessed by immunofluorescence and ELISA. OligoGM1 had no effect on microglial morphology or cytokine release under basal conditions. Upon αSyn challenge, cells exhibited increased amounts of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), triggered receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), elevated αSyn accumulation, and secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines. OligoGM1 pre-treatment significantly reduced the number and area of Iba1(+) cells, the intracellular αSyn burden in TREM2(+) microglia, and the release of interleukin 6 (IL-6). OligoGM1 selectively attenuated αSyn-induced microglial activation and enhanced αSyn clearance without compromising basal immune function. These findings confirm and support the potential of OligoGM1 as a multitarget therapeutic candidate for PD that is capable of modulating glial reactivity and neuroinflammatory responses.">

        <tr id="Disruption of the gut microenvironment is a hallmark of HIV infection, where regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in maintaining gut homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which gut Tregs contribute to immune reconstitution failure in HIV-infected individuals remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze gut Treg populations across three cohorts: eight immunological responders (IRs), three immunological non-responders (INRs), and four HIV-negative controls (NCs). Our findings revealed that INRs exhibit an increased proportion of gut Tregs but with significant functional impairments, including reduced suppressive capacity and heightened apoptotic activity. Notably, these Tregs underwent metabolic reprogramming in INRs, marked by an upregulation of glycolysis-related genes and a downregulation of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway. Additionally, both the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and SCFA concentrations were reduced in INRs. In vitro SCFA supplementation restored Treg function by enhancing suppressive capacity, reducing early apoptosis, and rebalancing cellular energy metabolism from glycolysis to OXPHOS. These findings provide a comprehensive characterization of gut Treg dysfunction in INRs and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting gut Tregs through microbiota and metabolite supplementation to improve immune reconstitution in HIV-infected individuals.">

Although immune responses significantly influence fracture healing post-polytrauma, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation require further investigation. While previous studies examined either injury site tissue or systemic tissue (peripheral blood), our study uniquely investigated both systemic and local immune cells at the same time to better understand polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation and associated impaired bone healing. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in a rat polytrauma model, we analyzed blood, bone marrow, and the local defect soft tissue to identify potential cellular and molecular targets involved in immune dysregulation. We identified a trauma-associated immunosuppressive myeloid (TIM) cell population that drives systemic immune dysregulation, immunosuppression, and potentially impaired bone healing. We found CD1d as a global marker for TIM cells in polytrauma. In the local defect tissue, we observed Spp1+ monocytes/macrophages mediating inflammatory, fibrotic, and impaired adaptive immune responses. Finally, our findings highlighted increased signaling via Anxa1-Fpr2 and Spp1-Cd44 axes. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of immune dysregulation-mediated nonunion following traumatic injury and provides biomarkers that could function as treatment targets.">

Despite advances in medical science, early detection, treatment, and prognosis remain significant challenges. In this study, we investigated the expression and functional role of ZDHHC19, a palmitoyltransferase enzyme, in sepsis. Our results demonstrate that ZDHHC19 is significantly upregulated in neutrophils during sepsis and correlates with inflammatory pathways critical to disease progression. High ZDHHC19 expression was associated with increased activation of immune-inflammatory processes such as collagen metabolism, myeloid cell activation, and cell adhesion, while suppressing antigen presentation. Additionally, ZDHHC19 expression was linked to poor patient prognosis, with higher levels correlating with increased mortality and sepsis shock. Using advanced computational tools, including XGBoost for machine learning-based core gene selection and CellChat for cell communication analysis, we identified key regulatory networks modulated by ZDHHC19, revealing its pivotal role in immune dysregulation. These findings suggest that ZDHHC19 may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis and open new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating immune responses in this condition.">

        <tr id="The development of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is characterized by extensive lung inflammation, which, in turn, leads to respiratory distress and a decline in blood oxygen levels. Hospital admission, along with intensive care or ventilator usage, becomes necessary because this condition leads to serious respiratory problems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic methods, and current therapeutic options for pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The pathophysiological process of severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by direct lung damage from viral replication, an excessive immune system response, inflammation, impaired gas exchange, and multi-organ failure. The coexistence of various medical conditions leads to substantial lung impairment, resulting in hypoxia and respiratory failure, which can ultimately lead to fatal outcomes. The diagnosis of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is made through a combination of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings. A multifaceted approach integrating antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, oxygen supplementation, ventilatory management, and immunomodulation is imperative to control inflammation and enhance clinical outcomes. Early intervention, meticulous monitoring, and personalized care are paramount for enhancing survival and mitigating complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.">

PAPOLG was knocked down or overexpressed in THP-1 macrophages. Target pathways were identified using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The levels of PAPOLG, transcriptional regulator nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were measured, along with an assessment of NF-κB mRNA stability. PAPOLG was significantly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected THP-1 macrophages. Genes subjected to alternative polyadenylation were enriched in immune pathways, and NF-κB emerged as a key regulator. Knockdown of PAPOLG promoted NF-κB mRNA degradation, while decreasing the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL6). Conversely, overexpression of PAPOLG stabilized NF-κB mRNA and enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 expression. PAPOLG contributes to the inflammatory response in SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages by stabilizing NF-κB mRNA. Thus, PAPOLG may be targeted to control COVID-19-related inflammation.">

        <tr id="Inhibiting neuronal ferroptosis is essential for mitigating neural damage and enhancing recovery in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH). Lactate accumulation correlates with ICH severity, yet the role of lactate-derived histone lactylation, a novel epigenetic modification, in ferroptosis and its mechanisms is not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of histone lactylation on neuronal ferroptosis in ICH models, both in vitro and in vivo. We discovered elevated lactate and histone lactylation post-ICH in mice, with a significant increase in H3K14la during the early stages of ferroptosis in hemin-challenged primary cortical neurons. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of H3K14la by targeting lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity effectively suppressed neuronal ferroptosis. We further identified p300/CBP and class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) as the key modifiers of H3K14la in this process. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in hemin-treated neurons, we pinpointed the Ca2+-ATPase PMCA2 encoding gene as a direct downstream target of H3K14la. H3K14la/PMCA2 promoted ferroptosis by elevating intracellular calcium levels. In line with our in vitro findings, inhibiting H3K14la/PMCA2 reduced neuronal degeneration and improved functional outcomes in an ICH mouse model induced by intracranial injection of collagenase into the striatum. Taken together, our findings elucidate the role of histone lactylation and PMCA2 in neuronal ferroptosis and implicate that targeting histone lactylation could be a promising therapeutic strategy for ICH and related CNS diseases.">

        <tr id="Background The spread of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and its subvariants, highly transmissible but responsible of milder disease, has increased unreported infection cases. Identifying unaware infected individuals is crucial for estimating the true prevalence of infection and evaluating the breadth of hybrid immunity. In this study, this challenge was addressed by applying several Machine Learning approaches. Methods A group of 116 participants, vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, was enrolled in the IMMUNO_COV study at Siena University Hospital, Italy. Blood samples were collected before and six months after third vaccine dose. Machine Learning analysis, involving dimensionality reduction techniques, unsupervised clustering methods and classification models, were applied to serological data including antibody responses specific for wild type SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 variants. Spike- and nucleocapsid-specific B cells were also assessed in each participant. Results Using dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering, participants are grouped into high- and low-responders, with infected participants mainly distributed within the high-responders. Implementation of a consensus-based approach, including k-NN, RF, and SVM models, identifies 14 participants unaware of previous infection. Their immunological profile, characterized by strong spike- and nucleocapsid-specific humoral and B cell responses, significantly differs from that of non-infected participants. Conclusions Machine Learning approaches are applied to identify participants unaware of prior infection and to dissect their hybrid immunity profiles. Based on serological data, this cost-effective method can be a valuable tool for estimating the true prevalence of infection, improving comprehension of immune responses elicited by vaccination alone or combined with infection, and tailoring public health interventions.">

In this study, we investigated the association between respiratory tract microbiota composition, immune markers, and molecular diagnostic parameters in 123 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Co-infection rates with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were high, particularly in the nasopharynx (35.4% and 64.4%, respectively), highlighting the risk of secondary bacterial infections. Diagnostic evaluation showed that RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values and serological markers (IgG, IgM) had high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing infection status. Lower Ct values correlated with higher viral loads and acute infection, while antibody levels reflected immune response dynamics. Significant correlations were observed between bacterial presence and immune parameters such as ACE-2, FASL, and RBD. These findings underscore the importance of integrated diagnostic approaches that consider microbiota, molecular, and immunological markers for effective management of COVID-19 and its complications.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory route. Following intranasal instillation, VSV moves along the axons of olfactory sensory neurons to the olfactory bulb. While within the olfactory bulb the spread of the virus is controlled by microglia activation and the recruitment of peripheral leukocytes, some of the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we used mice with conditional deletions of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an adaptor for RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling. By selectively deleting MAVS in neurons, astrocytes, or long-lived myeloid cells, we discovered that RLR signaling specifically within brain-resident myeloid cells is crucial for protection against the virus. Infected mice with a MAVS deletion in these myeloid cells showed normal myeloid cell and leukocyte infiltration into the brain. However, the P2RY12+ microglia showed aberrant expression of genes involved in antigen cross-presentation. Furthermore, flow cytometry experiments revealed diminished MHC class I expression on MAVS deficient microglia. Moreover, CNS infiltrating CD8+ T cells had dysfunctional transcriptional profiles. Therefore, our findings indicate that during viral CNS infection, MAVS signaling in brain-resident myeloid cells, presumably microglia, is essential for antigen cross-presentation and the relicensing of protective, infiltrating CD8+ T cells.

        <tr id="Background Malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS) is a lung complication affecting 5–25% of adults with severe malaria and has a mortality rate of ~ 40% despite mechanical ventilation. Effective recovery requires the resolution of inflammation, an active process involving pathogen clearance, suppression of inflammation, and tissue repair. While antimalarial drugs eliminate the parasite, they do not adequately promote resolution. Methods Using Nanostring nCounter technology, 840 inflammation- and metabolism-related genes were profiled in lung tissue from Plasmodium berghei NK65-infected mice, comparing untreated and antimalarial-treated groups to identify gene signatures specific to pathology and resolution. Results Among the resolution-specific genes, Alox12, encoding 12-lipoxygenase, was identified as a key regulator of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). However, functional studies targeting the 12-lipoxygenase pathway with the ML355 inhibitor or with Maresin Conjugate in Tissue Regeneration 1 supplementation did not affect survival or resolution outcomes. Further bioinformatic analysis of the Nanostring data revealed persistent T cell-driven inflammation, partial reduction in JAK/STAT signalling, altered chemokine expression and incomplete metabolic recovery during the resolution phase of MA-ARDS. Conclusions These findings suggest that while Nanostring profiling reveals critical processes in MA-ARDS resolution, targeting late-stage resolution alone by modulating SPM production is insufficient. This suggests that more effective, multi-targeted adjunctive therapies, alongside antimalarial drugs, may be required to improve survival and resolution upon MA-ARDS.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and associated with systemic inflammation. Inflammation is an important process that follows infection and facilitates the body's innate immune response and repair of damaged tissue. Polyunsaturated fatty acids play an important role in the inflammatory process. These lipids can target transcription factors to modulate gene expression and protein function. Methods Here, we performed a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and immunoassays to evaluate whether differences in basal levels of different types of biomarkers can be detected in freshly frozen plasma samples from patients with and without COVID‐19. Results FAME analysis showed a decrease in arachidic acid and myristic acid, but an increase in caprylic acid, palmitic acid, and eicosenoic acid in the plasma of COVID‐19 patients compared to non‐COVID‐19 patients. Multiple chemokines including IP‐10, MCP‐1, and MIP‐1 beta were increased in the COVID‐19 group compared to the non‐COVID‐19 group. Similarly, cytokines including IL‐1 alpha and IL‐8, and cell adhesion and inflammatory response markers including ICAM‐1 and E‐selectin were greater in the plasma of COVID‐19 patients compared to non‐COVID‐19 patients. Conclusions A baseline signature of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids, cytokines, and chemokines present in the plasma after COVID‐19 viral infection may serve as biomarkers that can be useful in various applications including determination of severity of infection, indication of disease prognosis, and consideration for therapeutic options.">

        <tr id="Background Immunosenescence describes the gradual remodeling of immune responses, leading to disturbed immune homeostasis and increased susceptibility of older adults for infections, neoplasia and autoimmunity. Decline in cellular immunity is associated with intrinsic changes in the T cell compartment, but can be further pushed by age-related changes in cells regulating T cell immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent inhibitors of T cell activation and function, whose induction requires chronic inflammation. Since aging is associated with low grade inflammation (inflammaging) and increased myelopoiesis, age-induced changes in MDSC induction and function in relation to T cell immunity were analyzed. Results MDSC numbers and functions were compared between “healthy” young and old adults, who were negatively diagnosed for severe acute and chronic diseases known to induce MDSC accumulation. MDSCs were either isolated from peripheral blood or generated in vitro from blood-derived CD14 cells. Aging was associated with significantly increased MDSC numbers in the monocytic- (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSC subpopulations. MDSCs could be induced more efficiently from CD14 cells of old donors and these MDSCs inhibited CD3/28-induced T cell proliferation significantly better than MDSCs induced from young donors. Serum factors of old donors supported MDSC induction comparable to serum factors from young donors, but increased immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs was only achieved by serum from old donors. Elevated immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs from old donors was associated with major metabolic changes and increased intracellular levels of neutral and oxidized lipids known to promote immunosuppressive functions. Independent of age, MDSC-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation required direct MDSC– T cell contact. Besides their increased ability to inhibit activation-induced T cell proliferation, MDSCs from old donors strongly shift the immune response towards Th2 immunity and might thereby further contribute to impaired cell-mediated immunity during aging. Conclusions These results indicate that immunosenescence of innate immunity comprises accumulation and functional changes in the MDSC compartment, which directly impacts T cell functions and contribute to age-associated impaired T cell immunity. Targeting MDSCs during aging might help to maintain functional T cell responses and increase the chance of healthy aging.

        <tr id="Natriuretic Peptides (NPs), including atrial (ANP) and brain (BNP) types, exert pleiotropic effects in regulating immune responses via the Natriuretic Peptide Receptor-1 (NPR1), expressed across various immune cells. While NPs are established inhibitors of inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in human monocytes, their role in dendritic cells (DCs)-key regulators of innate and adaptive immunity-remains unclear. Inflammasome activation in DCs can yield both protective and detrimental outcomes depending on the context of the disease, suggesting that modulating this pathway could offer a promising pharmacological strategy for controlling immune responses. This study explored the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by NPs in two conventional DC subsets: cDC1 and cDC2. We found that both subsets express basal levels of the NPR1 receptor, which increase under inflammatory conditions. Additionally, cDCs themselves produce ANP and BNP during inflammation. Although both subsets express basal levels of NLRP3 inflammasome proteins, cDC2 display a more robust NLRP3/IL-1β activation in response to LPS + ATP stimulation compared to cDC1. Notably, the NPs/NPR1 axis suppresses NLRP3 activation more effectively in the cDC2 subset by acting at translational and post-translational levels. These findings highlight NPs as a novel mechanism for controlling the inflammatory phenotype of cDCs and underscores NPs/NPR1 axis as therapeutic target for immune modulation of DC subsets. Graphical abstract cDC1 and cDC2 are equipped with the ANP/BNP–NPR1 axis and are sensitive to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP, through NPR1, represent a novel immunoregulatory mechanism that more effectively suppresses the inflammatory response in cDC2s than in cDC1. The NPs/NPR1 axis emerges as a potential therapeutic target for the control of pathological inflammation. Created in BioRender. https://BioRender.com/nrcr3m9">

        <tr id="The focal “hot spot” neuropathologies in COVID-19 infection are revealing footprints of a hidden underlying collapse of a novel ultrafast ultradian Piezo2 signaling system within the nervous system. Paradoxically, the same initiating pathophysiology may underpin the systemic findings in COVID-19 infection, namely the multiorgan SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced vascular pathologies and brain–body-wide systemic pro-inflammatory signaling, depending on the concentration and exposure to infecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This common initiating microdamage is suggested to be the primary damage or the acquired channelopathy of the Piezo2 ion channel, leading to a principal gateway to pathophysiology. This Piezo2 channelopathy-induced neural switch could not only explain the initiation of disrupted cell–cell interactions, metabolic failure, microglial dysfunction, mitochondrial injury, glutamatergic synapse loss, inflammation and neurological states with the central involvement of the hippocampus and the medulla, but also the initiating pathophysiology without SARS-CoV-2 viral intracellular entry into neurons as well. Therefore, the impairment of the proposed Piezo2-induced quantum mechanical free-energy-stimulated ultrafast proton-coupled tunneling seems to be the principal and critical underlying COVID-19 infection-induced primary damage along the brain axes, depending on the loci of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and intracellular entry. Moreover, this initiating Piezo2 channelopathy may also explain resultant autonomic dysregulation involving the medulla, hippocampus and heart rate regulation, not to mention sleep disturbance with altered rapid eye movement sleep and cognitive deficit in the short term, and even as a consequence of long COVID. The current opinion piece aims to promote future angles of science and research in order to further elucidate the not entirely known initiating pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the severe progression of an infection with Plasmodium falciparum, causing detrimental damage to brain tissue and is the most frequent cause of Plasmodium falciparum mortality. The critical role of brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the pathophysiology of CM having been revealed, our investigation focuses on the role of NR2F6, an established immune checkpoint, as a candidate driver of CM pathology. We employed an experimental mouse model of CM based on Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection to compare the relative susceptibility of Nr2f6-knock-out and wild-type C57BL6/N mice. As a remarkable result, Nr2f6 deficiency confers a significant survival benefit. In terms of mechanism, we detected less severe endotheliopathy and, hence, less damage to the blood–brain barrier (BBB), accompanied by decreased sequestered parasites and less cytotoxic T-lymphocytes within the brain, manifesting in a better disease outcome. We present evidence that NR2F6 deficiency renders mice more resistant to experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), confirming a causal and non-redundant role for NR2F6 in the progression of ECM disease. Consequently, pharmacological inhibitors of the NR2F6 pathway could be of use to bolster BBB integrity and protect against CM.">

        <tr id="Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), marked by persistent symptoms lasting weeks to months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, affects multiple organ systems including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and renal systems. These prolonged effects stem from chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and direct viral injury. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)—small non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation—play a pivotal role in this process by modulating immune responses, inflammation, and cellular stress. Altered miRNA expression patterns during and after infection contribute to the pathogenesis of Long COVID. While conventional miRNA detection techniques have been valuable, they face limitations in sensitivity, throughput, and detecting RNA modifications. This review highlights Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONS) as a promising alternative, offering real-time, long-read, amplification-free RNA sequencing that preserves native modifications. ONS enables direct sequencing of full-length miRNAs and their precursors, providing novel insights into miRNA processing and regulatory roles. Despite current challenges with short-read accuracy, ongoing technical advances are improving ONS performance. Its integration in miRNA profiling holds significant potential for uncovering novel regulatory interactions and advancing clinical biomarker discovery in Long COVID and other conditions.">

        <tr id="While viral pathogens are often subdivided into neurotropic and non-neurotropic categories, systemic inflammation caused by non-neurotropic viruses still possesses the ability to alter the central nervous system (CNS). Studies of CNS disease induced by viral infection, whether neurotropic or not, are presented with a unique set of challenges. First, because brain biopsies are rarely necessary to diagnose viral-associated neurological disorders, antemortem tissue samples are not readily available for study and human pathological studies must rely on end-stage, postmortem evaluations. Second, in vitro models fail to fully capture the nuances of an intact immune system, necessitating the use of animal models to fully characterize pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic approaches. Non-human primates (NHP) represent a particularly attractive animal model in that they overcome many of the limits posed by more distant species and most closely mirror human disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. Here, we review NHP infection models of viruses known to infect and/or replicate within cells of the CNS, including West Nile virus, the equine encephalitis viruses, Zika virus, and herpesviruses, as well as those known to alter the immune status of the brain in the absence of significant CNS penetrance, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the current era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV−2. This review focuses on viruses with an established role in causing CNS disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, and myelitis and NHP models of viral infection that are directly translatable to the human condition through relevant routes of infection, comparable disease pathogenesis, and responses to therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. The virus primarily spreads through person-to-person contact via aerosols and droplets, contributing to high case numbers and related morbidities. SARS-CoV-2 targets the respiratory tract, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as those with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a life-threatening genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to impaired respiratory function and recurrent severe respiratory symptoms. Despite their potential vulnerability, CF patients have shown a lower incidence of severe COVID-19, suggesting protective factors against SARS-CoV-2. Differential expression of the ACE2 receptor, crucial for viral entry, and other host factors, such as TMPRSS2, may play a role in this resistance to SARS-CoV-2. Analyzing the genomics and transcriptomics profiles of CF patients could provide insights into potential resistance mechanisms. The potential resistance mechanisms include blood and extracellular ATP levels, a deleted/dysfunctional CFTR gene, ACE and ACE2 regulation and expression, ACE and ACE2 polymorphism effects, host proteins and SARS-CoV-2 interactions, and SMN1 and ACE/ACE2 interactions. This review discusses the underlying factors and potential resistance mechanisms contributing to CF patients’ responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review provides an opportunity to further investigate future therapy and research through understanding the underlying potential resistance mechanisms exhibited by CF patients against SARS-CoV-2, including ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms.">

        <tr id="Long-lasting neurological issues, including cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression, that persist after recovery from acute inflammatory diseases, such as infections, have become a significant social problem, particularly following the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Various diagnostic techniques and biomarkers have been explored to objectively evaluate brain symptoms associated with infection–induced local or systemic inflammatory responses (i.e. immune fatigue); however, their detection capabilities remain limited. Here we investigated whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with a quantum-sensed molecule, parahydrogen-polarised [1-13C] pyruvate, could detect persistent brain metabolic alterations in a murine pseudo-infection model induced by polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (Poly(I: C)), a Toll-like receptor 3 ligand. Significant alterations in brain pyruvate metabolism favouring glycolysis were observed in both the acute and late phases of the pseudo-infection model, with a 12.7% and 2.5% decrease in bicarbonate flux, and a 58.4% and 32.2% increase in lactate flux on day 3 and week 2, respectively. These brain metabolic changes were accompanied by diminished dopamine signal markers in the striatum and nigra/ventral tegmental areas and reduced spontaneous nocturnal locomotor activity. A biochemical analysis of energy metabolic markers consistently supported the reprogramming of brain glucose metabolism, showing the suppression of oxidative phosphorylation during the acute phase and promotion of glycolysis during the late phase of Poly(I: C) treatment. Hyperpolarised 13C MRI of pyruvate metabolism is a promising non-invasive imaging biomarker for brain issues during the late phase of systemic infections and other neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, particularly in conditions lacking discernible morphological abnormalities.">

This study investigated the potential of sEVs as biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant patients, focusing on their role in organ transplants. Plasma samples from five lung transplant recipients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and five healthy controls were analyzed. The sEVs were isolated using an Invitrogen Exosome Isolation Kit, characterized by Nanosight NS300 for particle size (< 200 nm), and quantified for protein concentration using the BCA assay. Extracted protein from the sEVs was subjected to SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and western blotting to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. The results showed that the isolated sEVs from infected lung transplant patients contained significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins compared to those from the control group. Western blot analysis revealed strong bands corresponding to the spike and nucleocapsid proteins in infected patients, with statistical significance (p < 0.0001 for spike protein and p < 0.05 for nucleocapsid protein). These findings indicate that sEVs may serve as biomarkers for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these results and explore the broader therapeutic applications of sEVs in disease contexts. This study supports the potential utility of sEVs in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and monitoring transplant status, warranting additional investigation into their diagnostic value.">

Bacterial pneumonia poses a substantial global health burden, yet the immunological mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis and resolution are incompletely understood.


METHODS
We generated a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood immune cells from 100 individuals: 39 with severe bacterial pneumonia, 31 with mild disease, and 30 healthy controls. Integrating scRNA-seq with clinical and molecular data revealed profound remodeling of the peripheral immune landscape across disease severities.


MAIN RESULTS
Severe pneumonia was characterized by lymphopenia and monocytosis, accompanied by distinct shifts in T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell subset composition. Classical monocytes emerged as central orchestrators of the cytokine storm observed in severe cases, displaying elevated expression of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., S100A8/9/12) and enhanced TLR4-MYD88 signaling. Exhaustion of innate-like CD8+ T cells, marked by upregulation of canonical inhibitory receptors, was a hallmark of severe disease. In contrast, mild pneumonia exhibited robust CD8+ T effector and helper memory cell activation, along with effective humoral immunity, evidenced by plasma cell expansion and coordinated Tfh-B cell interactions. B cells in mild cases showed enhanced antigen recognition, BCR signaling, and co-stimulatory gene expression, whereas those in severe cases displayed signs of dysfunction. Myeloid cell alterations in severe pneumonia included increased monocytic MDSCs and non-classical monocytes, contributing to immunosuppression and complement overactivation, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
This high-resolution atlas of peripheral immune responses in bacterial pneumonia identifies key cellular and molecular drivers of disease severity, providing potential therapeutic targets for immunomodulation and improved outcomes.">

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke ranks among the top global causes of disability and mortality, with a highly dynamic pathological process. Post-stroke neuroinflammation, mediated by microglia, demonstrates a dual role in both injury and repair. The CX3CR1/CX3CL1 signaling axis, highly expressed in microglia, acts as a key regulator. This review examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of the axis across the stroke process and its involvement in neural repair. Crucially, this signaling pathway demonstrates stage-dependent functional duality: its cellular sources, receptor expression profiles, and functional consequences undergo temporally orchestrated shifts, manifesting coexisting or interconverting protective and damaging properties. Ignoring this dynamism compromises the therapeutic efficacy of targeted interventions. Thus, we propose a triple precision strategy of “stroke phase—biomarker—targeted intervention”. It uses specific biomarkers for precise staging and designs interventions based on each phase’s signaling characteristics. Despite challenges like biomarker validation, mechanistic exploration, and cross-species differences, integrating cutting-edge technologies such as spatial metabolomics and AI-driven dynamic modeling promises to shift stroke therapy toward personalized spatiotemporal programming. Temporally targeting CX3CR1 signaling may offer a key basis for developing next-generation precision neural repair strategies for stroke.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia damages alveolar type II cells and disrupts surfactant homeostasis, contributing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D) are critical for reducing alveolar surface tension and for innate immune defense. We aimed to evaluate whether surfactant protein gene expression varies with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 122 adults with confirmed COVID-19, categorized as asymptomatic (no symptoms), mild (requiring hospitalization), or severe (requiring ICU admission). We quantified mRNA expression of surfactant protein genes (SFTPA1, SFTPA2, SFTPB, SFTPC, SFTPD) in blood cells using RT-qPCR. Relative expression was normalized to GAPDH and compared among the groups using the 2−ΔΔCt method. Outliers (Ct values > 3 SD from the mean) were excluded before analysis. Results: Distinct surfactant gene expression patterns were markedly associated with disease severity. Transcripts of SFTPB and SFTPC decreased with increasing severity of the disease. Notably, SFTPC expression was ~49-fold higher in mild cases compared to asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients (p < 0.0001), but then decreased by ~54-fold in severe cases relative to mild (p < 0.0001), returning to near-baseline levels. In contrast, SFTPA2 and SFTPD were dramatically upregulated in severe cases. SFTPA2 was ~50-fold higher in severe versus mild cases (p < 0.0001), and SFTPD was ~4346-fold higher in severe versus asymptomatic cases (p < 0.0001; ~9.6-fold higher than in mild). SFTPA1 showed only a modest ~1.4-fold decrease in severe cases (vs. mild). All noted differences remained statistically significant after outlier exclusion. Conclusions: COVID-19 severity is correlated with profound changes in surfactant gene expression in blood. Critically ill patients exhibit loss of key surfactant components (SP-B and SP-C transcripts) alongside an excessive SP-D response. These preliminary findings suggest an imbalance that may contribute to lung injury in severe disease. However, further validation is needed to establish surfactant proteins, such as SP-D, as biomarkers of COVID-19 severity.">

It is further developed immuno-lung organoids comprising hPSC-derived alveolar and airway organoids co-cultured with macrophages to investigate the impact and underlying mechanisms of macrophage-mediated lung damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study not only establishes physiologically relevant immuno-lung organoid models for modeling macrophage-mediated tissue damage, but also identifies a previous unrecognized role of the THBS1-(ITGA3+ITGB1) pathway in driving lung cell senescence during infectious disease.">

        <tr id="Bacterial meningitis is a severe central nervous system infection with incompletely understood pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in blood-brain barrier disruption induced by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). In vitro studies revealed that ExPEC infection upregulated TLR4 expression in human brain microvascular endothelial cells and induced pyroptosis and tight junction protein degradation. TLR4 inhibition by TAK-242 significantly reduced pyroptosis and inflammatory responses but exacerbated tight junction disruption and bacterial invasion. In macrophages, TLR4 inhibition similarly attenuated pyroptosis and inflammatory responses. Interestingly, despite enhanced blood-brain barrier disruption and increased bacterial burden, TLR4-deficient mice showed significantly improved survival. Transcriptome analysis revealed that TLR4 deficiency triggered comprehensive reprogramming of host responses, characterized by both suppressed inflammatory damage and enhanced tissue homeostatic processes. This study demonstrates for the first time that endothelial pyroptosis is a novel mechanism for ExPEC-induced blood-brain barrier disruption and reveals the crucial role of TLR4 in balancing protective and destructive host responses, providing new insights for therapeutic strategies against bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="Elderly individuals were disproportionally affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, and more than 80% of the global COVID-19-related deaths between 2020 and 2021 occurred among people aged 60 years or older. Several cellular modifications in aged cells may lead to systemic inflammation and fibrotic responses. Age or exogenous insults induce cellular senescence, further increasing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, leading to the condition known as inflammaging, that can contribute to disease severity. Older individuals presented signs of systemic hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19, but few studies analyzed the influence of age on lung tissue responses in cases of severe COVID-19. We hypothesized that age related alterations regarding innate/acquired immunity and cellular senescence in lung tissue of individuals without lung diseases could predispose to viral infection. We also aimed to identify how the aged lung responded to severe COVID-19 infection. We studied lung tissues from 19 individuals that died from non-pulmonary causes and 28 adult individuals who died from COVID-19 between March and May of 2020, divided according to their age (> or < 60 years). Tissue sections were stained, via immunohistochemistry, and 19 markers among immune cells, COVID-19 receptors, cytokines and senescence were analyzed in the lung parenchyma of both groups. In the COVID-19 group, the Luminex multiplex assay technique was used to detect a panel of 25 cytokines/chemokines. In control lungs, aged individuals had a lower TLR7 expression, without differences in other markers. Older patients had a shorter time between onset of symptoms and death, with a significant negative correlation with age. Unlike the adult younger group, older COVID − 19 patients presented significant differences in relation to their age matched controls in the expression of CD8 + T cells, IFN-α2, TLR7, pSTAT-3, p21 and p53. They also presented higher protein expression that IFN-α2 and TGF-beta than the adult COVID-19 group, with a trend to decreased CD20 + cell density in the lungs. Taken together, our data show age adversely affects the lung expression of key proteins related to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, by perpetuating inflammation and increasing pro-fibrotic responses.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in long-term multiorgan complications, with the kidney being a primary target. This study aimed to characterize the long-term transcriptomic changes in the kidney following coronavirus infection using a murine model of MHV-1-induced SARS-like illness and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SPIKENET (SPK). Methods: A/J mice were infected with MHV-1. Renal tissues were collected and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis and Next Generation RNA Sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes associated with acute and chronic infection. Bioinformatic analyses, including PCA, volcano plots, and GO/KEGG pathway enrichment, were performed. A separate cohort received SPK treatment, and comparative transcriptomic profiling was conducted. Gene expression profile was further confirmed using real-time PCR. Results: Acute infection showed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Long-term MHV-1 infection led to the sustained upregulation of genes involved in muscle regeneration, cytoskeletal remodeling, and fibrotic responses. Notably, both expression and variability of SLC22 and SLC22A8, key proximal tubule transporters, were reduced, suggesting a loss of segment-specific identity. Further, SLC12A1, a critical regulator of sodium reabsorption and blood pressure, was downregulated and is associated with the onset of polyuria and hydronephrosis. SLC transporters exhibited expression patterns consistent with tubular dysfunction and inflammation. These findings suggest aberrant activation of myogenic pathways and structural proteins in renal tissues, consistent with a pro-fibrotic phenotype. In contrast, SPK treatment reversed the expression of most genes, thereby restoring the gene profiles to those observed in control mice. Conclusions: MHV-1-induced long COVID is associated with persistent transcriptional reprogramming in the kidney, indicative of chronic inflammation, cytoskeletal dysregulation, and fibrogenesis. SPK demonstrates robust therapeutic potential by normalizing these molecular signatures and preventing long-term renal damage. These findings underscore the relevance of the MHV-1 model and support further investigation of SPK as a candidate therapy for COVID-19-associated renal sequelae.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves dysregulation of innate immune cells including monocytes, especially in progressive MS. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are essential for fatty acid transport and metabolism in multiple cell types. FABP7, a brain-FABP, maintains metabolic function in astrocytes and neural stem cells, but the effect of FABP7 on monocytes is unknown. Here we find elevated levels of FABP7 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with secondary progressive MS. Elevated serum FABP7 levels positively correlate with higher disability scores, brain lesion volumes, and lower brain volumes. FABP7 levels are increased in astrocytes from MS postmortem brain lesion. Mechanistically, in vitro treatment of FABP7 induces CD16, CD80 and IL-1β expression in monocytes via increased glycolysis. FABP7-induced gene expression reflects enhanced inflammation, chemotaxis and glucose metabolism in monocytes. In conclusion, we find that FABP7 induces pro-inflammatory profiles in monocytes, correlates with disability and represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Background Persistent symptoms and complications reported by many patients for more than four weeks after contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome. These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability. Methods In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level of p < 0.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software. Results Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has triggered a global health crisis, with over 700 million confirmed cases and at least 7 million deaths reported by early 2024. Children are less vulnerable to severe SARS‐CoV‐2 infection than adults and typically experience milder respiratory symptoms. However, a rare but significant complication, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS‐C), can develop weeks after infection, characterized by a spectrum of inflammatory symptoms. This study employed whole‐exome sequencing and over‐representation analysis to identify genetic variants of potential clinical significance related to MIS‐C or severe COVID‐19 in a group of children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), all of whom were unvaccinated for COVID‐19. We observed the enrichment of potentially pathogenic genetic variants in genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, particularly glycogen breakdown, in severe COVID‐19 pediatric patients, and in genes related to cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in MIS‐C patients. These findings offer insights into the genetic underpinnings of MIS‐C and severe COVID‐19, suggesting potential genes and biological pathways for further research.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection induces a hyperinflammatory response to promote inflammatory injury in multiple tissues. However, the relative mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we first confirmed that PRV infection could trigger pyroptosis to cause lung injury, evidenced by the increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in lung tissue of infected piglets and mice. Subsequently, we observed that PRV-induced lung lesions and mortality were improved in Gsdmd−/− mice rather than in Ripk3−/− mice. The number of NK cells was markedly higher in Gsdmd−/− mice than in WT mice. Based on this finding, refilling NK cells could significantly alleviate the replication of PRV in the lungs of mice and alleviate lung injury caused by PRV infection, whereas depletion of NK cells aggravated PRV infection and led to severe lung lesions. Notably, gasdermin D (GSDMD) deficiency could reduce the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) positive macrophages and the depletion of NK cells induced by PRV infection to alleviate the pathogenicity of PRV, while TNF-α neutralizing antibody could also reduce the PRV-induced NK cell depletion to alleviate the pathogenicity of PRV. Ultimately, we found that necrosulfonamide (NSA) showed a good protective effect on PRV-infected mice and had good anti-PRV activity in vivo. Collectively, our findings illuminate a new regulatory mechanism by which PRV infection induces NK cell depletion to weaken the antiviral ability of the host to promote virus replication and activate GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in lung tissue, leading to severer lung injury, and NSA is expected to be a candidate agent for the prevention and control of PRV infection. IMPORTANCE Necroptosis and pyroptosis are the most common regulated necrotic cell death pathways in various pathogenic infection-induced tissue damage. Herein, we found that gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis is a critical cell death pathway in pseudorabies virus (PRV)-induced lung inflammatory injury rather than receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated necroptosis. PRV infection induces NK cell depletion to weaken the antiviral ability of the host to promote viral replication. GSDMD deficiency can reduce the depletion of NK cells induced by PRV infection by reducing the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-positive macrophages, thereby attenuating lung tissue lesions in PRV-infected mice. Whereas the use of necrosulfonamide (NSA) showed a good protective effect on PRV-infected mice. This study reveals that PRV infection can excessively activate macrophages to secrete more TNF-α to induce NK cell depletion to facilitate PRV infection and aggravate viral pathogenicity, and clarifies the roles of GSDMD in modulating macrophage activity and NK cell death, and also provides an effective inhibitor for use against PRV infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, and neuroinflammation are common features present in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and glial cells are essential mediators of the inflammatory reaction. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor engaged in regulation of immune function, may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, through modulation of neuroinflammation. This study explores how AhR affects astrocyte function in response to inflammatory stimuli, with emphasis on Aβ. Methods and Results In primary hippocampal astrocyte cultures from wild type (WT, C57BL6/J) or AhR germline knockout (AhRKO) mice, pretreatment with the AhR agonist, 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ), attenuated Aβ-induction of reactive astrocyte development, characterized by decreased astrocyte complement C3 expression and decreased proinflammatory cytokine release. In addition, Aβ exposure exacerbated TNF-a cytokine release and increased GFAP immunoreactivity in astrocytes derived from AhRKO mice. In response to Aβ injection into the mouse hippocampus in vivo, AhRKO mice demonstrated increased astrocyte hypertrophy, reinforcing AhR function in regulating astrocyte responses to neuroinflammation. Discussion These findings suggest that AhR activation in astrocytes attenuates development of the neuroinflammatory state, and identifies AhR as an interesting therapeutic target to mitigate neuroinflammation and the progression of AD.">

As it has been discovered that Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) result in caseating granulomas in TB and pathology in COVID-19, we conducted this work to determine the amounts of NET molecules in the bloodstream and to comprehend their function during TB and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We recruited 43 healthy volunteers, 40 newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody and 18 newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Results Although Citrullinated Histone H3 and myeloperoxidase, did not show any difference in their levels, the NET marker elastase had significantly reduced circulatory levels in the tuberculosis group with SARS-CoV IgG positivity compared to tuberculosis group without SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity. Discussion The substantial decrease in elastase levels observed in the diabetic cohort of TB patients with SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity is intriguing and needs large cohort studies in the future to understand the influence of diabetes in TB patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Complement dysregulation and immune hyperactivation are pivotal factors contributing to the mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Engineered Antibody-like proteins (ALPs) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are engineered to address immune dysregulation in COVID-19. In this study, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41, two such ALPs, are developed using cDNA display technology. These ALPs demonstrate strong binding affinity for the spike protein and effectively inhibit its interaction with ACE2 and several C-type lectins, including MBL, DC-SIGN, and L-SIGN. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses reveal that Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 suppress complement activation via the lectin pathway, reduce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and attenuate hyper-inflammatory responses. In mouse models, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 significantly mitigate inflammation, NETosis, and lung tissue damage induced by the spike protein. These results suggest that these ALPs hold promise as therapeutic candidates for alleviating SARS-CoV-2-induced immune dysfunction, with the potential to reduce severe COVID-19 outcomes and long-term sequelae.

the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines, along with 89 healthy individuals. Circulating markers of netosis and pyroptosis, including
neutrophil elastase (NE), citrullinated histone H3 (CitH-H3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-18, and
IL-8, were analyzed using the ELISA method. The effects of netosis and pyroptosis markers on disease severity and clinical parameters were
comparatively evaluated, and their associations with inflammation, thrombosis, and fibrinolysis were also investigated.
Results: NE, GSDMD, IL-18, MPO, CITH3, D-dimer, leukocyte and lymphocyte levels, as well as inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin), showed
a significantly elevated in severe COVİD-19 patients compare to the other groups.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that circulating netosis and pyroptosis markers in SARS-CoV-2 infections correlate with inflammation,
dysregulated hemostasis, and fibrinolysis markers, playing a role in disease prognosis. These associations may provide potential therapeutic
targets for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with demyelination and microglial activation. Significant progress has recently been made in the development of strategies to treat MS with a focus on microglial cells. In response to injury, microglia, a population of mononuclear phagocytic cells, change from quiescent to activated. M1 microglia produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause additional injury, thus they are considered neurotoxic microglia. M2 microglia release anti-inflammatory factors that lead to the suppression of inflammatory responses; therefore, they have a neurotrophic phenotype. The balance between M1 and M2 phenotypes is important for nerve recovery. In neurodegenerative diseases, activated microglia are excessively shifted toward M1 or neurotoxic phenotype due to microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. The miRNA as a class of non-coding RNAs, control the neuroinflammatory process by activation of microglia. The miR-124 is partly responsible for suppressing the neuroprotective and inflammatory processes by preventing microglia activation. Meanwhile, the microRNA 155, which is induced by pro-inflammatory agents in microglia, promotes the inflammatory process. Several studies have shown that in MS pathogenesis, miR-124 as an anti-inflammatory marker is significantly downregulated, while miR-155 shows an increase. In this study, we will investigate the role of miR-124 and miR-155 in the activation and alteration of microglial phenotype. Finding the relationship between microRNAs and glial cells and inflammation in MS may be used as a therapeutic method to reduce the symptoms in MS patients.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disease with limited effective therapeutic options. Recent studies have highlighted mitochondrial damage as a crucial factor in the progression of ALI. Mitophagy, which facilitates the removal of damaged mitochondria, has been shown to reduce inflammation. Our collaborators constructed a small molecule mitophagy inducer, TJ0113. TJ0113 has been approved to initiate a Phase I clinical trial for Alport syndrome and a Phase II trial for Parkinson's disease in China. Therefore, we explored the potential of TJ0113 as a novel therapeutic for ALI. Methods The mitophagy-inducing potential of TJ0113 was assessed in HEK293T cells. The anti-inflammatory effects of TJ0113 were further evaluated in vivo using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and in vitro using LPS-stimulated bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Results TJ0113 selectively induced mitophagy in damaged mitochondria. Furthermore, the PINK1–Parkin pathway was identified as a specific mitophagy pathway induced by TJ0113. In LPS-induced ALI mouse model, intraperitoneal injection of TJ0113 significantly reduced lung inflammation and mortality. In vitro, TJ0113 significantly inhibited the expression of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines in BMDMs. Finally, we found that TJ0113 inhibited LPS-induced inflammation by inducing mitophagy and inhibiting nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and inflammasome activation. Conclusion TJ0113 alleviates LPS-induced inflammation by inducing mitophagy and inhibiting NF-κB and inflammasome activation. Its selective action on damaged mitochondria suggests minimal side effects, positioning TJ0113 as a promising therapeutic candidate for ALI.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astrocytes play a crucial role in mediating neuroinflammation, particularly under pathological conditions where they can enter into senescent or gliotic states. This study explored the induction of these two astrocytic states using the same stressor, palmitate, in primary cortical astrocytes. A transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct expression profiles both astrocytes phenotypes. Senescent astrocytes upregulated genes involved in cell cycle arrest and the Senescence‐Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), including IGFBP5, CDKN1A, and p53. In contrast, reactive astrocytes upregulated genes related to immune response, complement activation, and inflammation, such as C3, LCN2, and pro‐inflammatory cytokines like IL‐11 and CXCL12. Despite these differences, both astrocytic states shared pro‐inflammatory characteristics, contributing to neuroinflammation. The secretory profiles further distinguished the two states: senescent astrocytes produced higher levels of interleukins, including IL‐6 and IL‐18, indicative of sustained inflammatory responses. Gliotic astrocytes, on the other hand, secreted higher levels of chemokines, such as MCP‐1 and GRO‐α, involved in immune cell recruitment and tissue repair. Senescent astrocytes were more active in cytokine production, while gliotic astrocytes promoted immune responses and tissue repair through chemokine production. Understanding these distinct roles provides valuable insights for developing therapeutic interventions to mitigate neuroinflammation and support healthy brain aging.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has affected at least 989 dairy herds across 17 states in the United States (U.S.) and resulted in 70 confirmed human infections, underscoring the urgent need to understand the pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions of emerging H5N1 viruses. In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 mortality disproportionately affects the elderly, yet the cellular and molecular factors contributing to age-related immune system remodeling remain unclear. Using SARS-CoV-derived ssRNA sequences, we modeled age-dependent immune responses in mice. Aged mice exhibited higher mortality and severe lung inflammation upon viral ssRNA challenge, mirroring clinical observations. We uncovered a pre-existing inflammatory state in aged mice, characterized by elevated baseline levels of specific immune cells and cytokines correlating with poor outcomes. Age-related immune dysfunction stemmed from impaired IRF7 signaling and defective SNARE-mediated cytokine secretion in CD11b+ cells. Notably, the adoptive transfer of young CD11b+ cells to aged mice exposed to SARS-CoV2 ssRNA reduced mortality, alleviated lung inflammation, and normalized cytokine profiles. These findings provide insights into age-related immune dysregulation during viral challenges and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for severe COVID-19 in the elderly.">

        <tr id="Increased iron levels, common in neurodegenerative diseases, correlate with disease severity, suggesting a role in the pathological process. Recently, efforts have been made to understand the role of iron in cerebral inflammatory processes. Employing astrocyte cell models of genetic neurodegenerative pathologies characterized by iron imbalance, such as the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorders, can provide valuable insights into astrocytes reactivity, a pivotal process in brain inflammation. Specifically, we employed human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes from Neuroferritinopathy, where iron accumulation is primary. After confirming iron accumulation and the deregulation of proteins involved in iron management, we observed that at 35 days since the beginning of differentiation, the elevated iron levels not only trigger ferroptosis but also place the astrocytes in a reactive state. This is evident in the higher extracellular concentrations of IL-6, IL-1β, and glutamate, along with changes in morphology, genes, and proteins involved in astrocyte reactivity. Interestingly, by day 60, IL-6 and IL-1β levels drop below those of the controls, and we observe a reversal in most of the factors considered. Moreover, at day 60, it is possible to observe not only increased senescence but also ferroptosis. These findings demonstrate that iron plays a primary role in inducing astrocyte reactivity.">

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies have investigated the inflammatory responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 2021, it was proposed that the cytokine storm observed in patients with severe COVID-19 may be initiated by sensing of cytoplasmic DNA released by micronuclei, which arises as a consequence of virus-induced genomic instability. Subsequent studies have described the presence of micronuclei and other genotoxic and cytotoxic markers in COVID-19 patients. However, the association between the development of a cytokine storm and cytoplasmic DNA sensing remains to be fully elucidated. In this review, we summarize current evidence on the dysregulated cytokine production in response to the detection of genetic material during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We focused mainly on the dysregulated production of cytokines induced by the activation of cytosolic DNA sensing pathways that promote inflammation. We emphasize the need to analyze the contribution of these signaling complexes to COVID-19 pathophysiology. DNA sensing amplifies the inflammatory response and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of severe disease manifestations observed in infected patients. Understanding this complex interplay can provide insights into potential therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating the hyper-inflammatory responses seen in severe COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic infection that affects the central nervous system. However, its high infectivity makes comprehensive research with the active virus challenging. Here, we use virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type mice and in mice that express the human tau protein. VLP exposure elicits changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings in primary somatosensory and motor cortices reveal substantial short-term increases in cortical activity in VLP-injected mice, with increased stimulus-evoked activity in both genotypes and elevated spontaneous activity in the human tau genotype only. Vehicle-injected human tau mice also show increases in cortical activity patterns. Over the following weeks, activity metrics partially subside but do not completely return to baseline levels. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. Middle-aged human tau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background and overexpression of the tau protein, exhibit more severe pathobiology and may be at risk for more adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is a key driver of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In AD, microglia are activated and trigger an increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. Rhein, an anthraquinone compound extracted from rhubarb, has been shown to reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1β in activated microglia. However, the mechanism of rhein on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in AD remains unclear. In this study, we found that rhein improved behavioral abnormalities in AD rats and reduced the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, iNOS, and NO in the brain of AD rats. In the LPS-induced microglial model, rhein significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory factors to improve neuroinflammation. Untargeted metabolomics showed that the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism occurred in M1 microglia. Targeted metabolomics and 13C, 15N isotope tracing experiments demonstrated that rhein regulated the metabolite levels in the glutamine–aspartate–arginine metabolic pathway. Meanwhile, the upregulated expression of proteins such as GLS1 and GOT1 within this pathway was reversed by rhein. Furthermore, we found that the glutamine–aspartate–arginine metabolic pathway regulates the production of nitric oxide (NO, a neuroinflammatory mediator). Rhein alleviates neuronal damage by inhibiting the glutamine–aspartate–arginine–NO metabolic pathway. In conclusion, our study shows that rhein may inhibits NO production by regulating the glutamine–aspartate–arginine metabolic pathway in activated microglia, thereby inhibiting the neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in AD.">

        <tr id="Influenza causes 3–5 million severe cases globally each year, with severe viral pneumonia often requiring hospitalization for over four weeks. While the inflammatory response to influenza infection helps control viral replication, excessive inflammation is a key driver of disease severity and mortality. Excessive pulmonary lymphocytes, particularly IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes, contribute significantly to pulmonary inflammation at the late-stage of H1N1 viral infection. Cyclosporin A, a potent T-cell inhibitor, mitigates influenza A virus-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. However, the therapeutic role of lymphocyte suppression in cyclosporin A-mediated attenuation of H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the viral titer was 0 in all the homogenized lung tissues of mice on Day-21 post a sublethal H1N1 viral infection. H1N1 viral infection caused worsened general condition and pulmonary inflammation with the infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils on Day-21 post-infection. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of H1N1 virus-infected mice showed a 16-fold higher lymphocyte count compared to neutrophils. H1N1 viral infection significantly elevated both IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations and IFN-γ levels in mouse lungs. H1N1 viral infection additionally expanded IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations in both spleen and peripheral blood. Cyclosporin A treatment significantly mitigated H1N1 viral infection-induced worsened general condition, pulmonary lymphocytic inflammation, increases of pulmonary IFN-γ concentrations and IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes in the lung, spleen and blood of mice on Day-21 post-infection. Together, lymphocytes may contribute significantly to H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation. Cyclosporin A may alleviate H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation through decreasing IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes.

        <tr id="Goal The present study intended to evaluate whether the profile of soluble immune mediators observed in cord blood samples resembles the pattern identified for mother serum samples. Methods For this purpose, parallel analysis of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors was carried out in mother–newborn paired samples from acute and convalescent COVID-19 subgroups (Early, Intermediate, and Late) as well as healthy controls (HC). Results Data demonstrated that increased levels of CCL11, IFN-γ, IL1-Ra, and G-CSF were observed in cord blood samples from most COVID-19 subgroups, with fold change magnitude from 1.6× to 8.2× as compared with HC. Comparative analysis of mother–newborn pairs demonstrated that several immune mediators (CCL11, CCL4, IFN-γ, PDFG, and G-CSF) exhibited high increment magnitude in cord blood as compared with mother serum, reaching values up to 15.7×, mainly at convalescent COVID-19 infection. The signatures of soluble immune mediators revealed distinct waveforms for cord blood and mother serum, with a waning of immune mediators in the latter, contrasting with the increasing set of molecules in the former from acute toward convalescent COVID-19. Integrative network analysis of immune mediators in mother–newborn pairs showed an increase of neighborhood connectivity both in microenvironments and in their interplay from acute toward late convalescent COVID-19. Our results support the hypothesis of the interplay between mother serum and cord blood microenvironment that may impact the fetus development. Conclusion Together, this evidence regarding the maternal–fetal crosstalk can ultimately subsidize the improvement of clinical practice and public health policies for management of prenatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Vascular leakage (VL) is a severe pathology occurring in a broad range of scenarios, e.g., during sepsis, cytokine storms, or as side effect of immunotherapies. Its severity is underlined by the high lethality rate of 20−30% for the systemic capillary leakage syndrome. While many compounds are reported to affect endothelial cell (EC)-activation, exact mechanisms behind VL remain unclear. We analyzed activation, viability, cytokine secretion, and relative permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) upon treatment with 16 different stimuli. Relative HUVEC-permeability was assessed in a trans-well-based leakage assay in presence or absence of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). HUVEC-activation is characterized by correlating upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and E-selectin, as well as production of interleukin (IL)-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and IL-6. Strong HUVEC-activation and reduced viability was observed upon treatment with IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a TGN1412-induced cytokine cocktail (SNTGN1412), thrombin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Only thrombin, SNTGN1412, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) led to increased relative permeability, while other compounds associated with vascular leakage, including TNF-α, IL-1β, or LPS, had no direct effect on relative HUVEC-permeability. Interestingly, co-cultures with PBMCs mediated IL-1β- and LPS- but not TNF-α-induced relative HUVEC-permeability. In our study, we show that HUVEC activation upon direct stimulation does not necessarily result in increased relative permeability or massive cytokine production. Interestingly, we could demonstrate that activated HUVECs respond with a conserved pattern of markers, independent from the stimulus used. Moreover, we observed that the interplay with immune cells is critical to enhance relative HUVEC-permeability, which however depended on the stimulus applied suggesting different mechanisms of immune-mediated VL. A better understanding of VL will uncover potential treatment-targets for patients suffering from VL and help to improve safety-assessment of leakage-associated immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Objective To investigate the protective role of microRNA-27b (miR-27b) in septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) and its regulatory mechanism on the mitochondrial fission factor (Mff)/mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) axis. Methods Transcriptome data from septic patients’ cardiac tissues (GSE79962) were analyzed. Serum miR-27b expression was measured in SCM patients (n=11), sepsis-only patients (n=22), and healthy controls (n=30). Mouse SCM model and HL-1 cardiomyocyte model were established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. The molecular mechanism was investigated using miR-27b agonist/antagonist and Mff intervention, combined with RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy. Results Bioinformatics analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-27b in SCM cardiac tissues (log2FC=-3.9, P<0.001). Clinical validation showed lower miR-27b expression in SCM patients’ serum compared to sepsis-only patients and healthy controls (P<0.05). LPS-induced SCM model exhibited cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury, mitochondrial abnormalities, decreased miR-27b expression, and increased Mff and MAVS levels. miR-27b targeted Mff to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, thus attenuating LPS-induced cardiomyocyte inflammation and apoptosis, while Mff overexpression reversed this protective effect. Conclusion miR-27b alleviates myocardial injury and inflammation in SCM by targeting the Mff/MAVS axis to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, representing a potential novel therapeutic target for SCM.">

        <tr id="Pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a self-limiting disease. Its progression and prognosis are highly heterogeneous among people of different ages, genders, and living with different life styles. Such heterogeneity also exists in treatment outcomes of different patients. Various physiological and pathological factors, such as renewal of pulmonary cell, number of entry receptor and viral replication, have been identified linking to the development of the disease. However, it is still unclear how these factors collectively establish a causal relationship in the course of disease progression. In this study, we built a mechanistic model to explain the dynamics of infection and progression of COVID-19. We modeled how the interaction of pulmonary cells determine the dynamics of disease progression by characterizing the temporal dynamics of viral load, infected and health alveolar cells, and dysfunctional alveolar cells. The viral and cellular dynamics captured different stages of clinical manifestations in individual patient during disease progression: the incubation period, mild symptom period, and severe period. We further simulated clinical interference at different stages of disease progression. The results showed that some medical interventions show no improvement either in reducing the recovery rate or shortening the recovery time. Our theoretical framework may provide a mechanistic explanation at the systems level for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 as well as other similar respiratory tract diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Circulating platelets are increasingly recognized for their critical involvement in thromboinflammatory complications during respiratory infections, underscoring the importance of comprehending their dual role in immunomodulation and hemostasis. The multifaceted roles of platelets are attributed to their inherent heterogeneity, where the molecular diversity enables their functional versatility. However, research remains deficient in dissecting platelet heterogeneity within respiratory infection contexts, capturing the platelet subpopulations exhibiting specialized functional roles, and elucidating the therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab. Methods Leveraging the adequate platelet population detected through single-cell RNA sequencing, this study established stratified study cohorts central to: (1) COVID-19 disease severity, (2) therapeutic responsiveness, and (3) non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. An integrative annotation framework was implemented in this study, which encompassed co-expressed gene module identification, cell-cell communication network mapping, and cell trajectory assessment, to hierarchically dissect the functional dynamics of platelet heterogeneity in disease pathologies and their modulation by therapeutic interventions. Results This study unfolds six severity-associated platelet subpopulations, explores their modulation by corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments, and extends the findings to non-COVID-19 severe conditions. In severe COVID-19, platelet subpopulations with elevated innate immune responsiveness and high coagulation potential are intensively enriched, whereas following dexamethasone administration, this pro-coagulable subpopulation is remarkably repressed. Post-tocilizumab treatment, the instructive interaction from platelets to IFN-activated CD8+ T cells is reduced, while communications from memory B cells, CD4+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to platelets are enhanced. A platelet trajectory, which participates in neutrophil chemotaxis and B cell-mediated humoral responses, emerges specifically in COVID-19 conditions and is absent in non-COVID-19. Conclusions A systematic investigation of platelet transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory infections, combined with the delineation of its therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab, advances the understanding of platelet involvement in immune-thrombotic dysregulation and provides a foundation for exploring potential therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="Current pharmacological treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) predominantly employs dopaminergic agents aimed at enhancing cerebral dopamine levels. While these therapeutic strategies provide symptomatic relief, their palliative nature is frequently associated with dose-dependent complications, including gastrointestinal disturbances, emetic symptoms, and motor complications such as dyskinesia. Moreover, the honeymoon period of drugs has greatly limited their clinical application. The multifactorial etiology of PD continues to challenge researchers, yet substantial evidence implicates α-synuclein as a critical pathogenic mediator. Emerging findings suggest that dysregulated neuroimmune interactions constitute a fundamental mechanism in PD progression, where chronic immune activation appears particularly detrimental to neuronal survival. Notably, neuroinflammatory cascades coupled with compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity create a self-perpetuating cycle of neural degeneration, wherein α-synuclein-specific T cells exacerbate disease pathology while regulatory T cell populations demonstrate potential immunomodulatory capacities. This review systematically examines the mechanistic interplay involving neuroinflammatory cascades, BBB compromise, central nervous system (CNS) immunoregulation, and T lymphocyte subpopulations (including regulatory T cells) in the pathogenesis of PD. By synthesizing current evidence, we aim to establish a conceptual framework supporting the investigation of cellular immunity-based therapies for PD.">

        <tr id="Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) represent a uniquely vulnerable population due to intrinsic immunological dysfunction and a high prevalence of comorbid conditions. This review examines the complex interplay between natural and vaccine-induced immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in this group, focusing on viral entry, immune activation, and immune evasion mechanisms. Particular attention is given to the impaired cellular and humoral responses seen in PD patients, including reduced T-cell function, diminished antibody production, and abnormal cytokine signaling, all of which contribute to an elevated risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of various vaccine platforms, including inactivated, vector-based, and mRNA formulations, are critically assessed, with an emphasis on the role of booster doses in enhancing protection amid waning immunity and evolving viral variants. Furthermore, the review highlights the advantages of PD as a home-based modality that is compatible with telemedicine and may reduce the risk of viral exposure. These insights underscore the importance of developing individualized vaccination strategies, maintaining close immunological surveillance, and implementing innovative dialysis care approaches to improve clinical outcomes during the ongoing pandemic and future public health crises. Tailored booster strategies and telemedicine-integrated care models are essential for improving outcomes in this high-risk population.">

Beyond respiratory complications, the disease involves systemic manifestations driven by immune dysregulation, inflammation, and coagulopathy. Among the many mechanisms implicated in severe disease, a growing body of evidence suggests a central role for the imbalance between proteases and antiproteases. This review examines how dysregulated protease activity contributes to viral entry, cytokine activation, vascular injury, and thrombosis. We focus on the integration of proteolytic systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, coagulation cascade, and neutrophil extracellular traps with established pathways like endothelial dysfunction and immune hyperactivation.

        <tr id="Background: The progressive course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is more frequently observed in individuals with obesity, diabetes, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, or arterial hypertension. Many patients with these conditions are prescribed statins to treat hypercholesterolaemia. However, statins exhibit additional pleiotropic effects. The present study aims to investigate the effects of all eight currently existing statins on the expression of genes whose products have been reported to be directly associated with complicated COVID-19 disease. Methods: We extended the interpretation of the whole-genome DNA microarray analyses of pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa-2 and whole-transcriptome analyses of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells AD-MSC that we had performed in the past. From the number of genes with altered expression induced by statins, we focused on those reported to be involved in a complicated course of COVID-19, including APOE and ACE2, genes encoding proteins involved in innate antiviral immunity and respiratory failure genes. Results: Although we did not observe statin-induced changes in the expression of APOE, ACE2 and any of the six genes clustered in the locus associated with respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19, some statins induced changes in the expression of genes encoding their interaction partners. Among genes associated with the immune system, all statins, which are effective in vitro affected the expression of genes encoding IL-6 and IL-8 and interaction partners of NF-kB, which may influence the duration of viral persistence. Conclusions: Statins act on multiple pathways simultaneously, some of which support COVID-19 development, while others suppress it.">

        <tr id="Background Periodontitis is a risk factor linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology. Mounting evidence suggests a contributory role of periodontitis in the onset and progression of AD. Type I interferons are upregulated in Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)-induced periodontitis in murine models. Colonization of Pg has been identified in the brains of patients with AD. Recently, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), an inflammation-induced innate immunity protein, was identified as a novel γ-secretase modulatory protein for Aβ production in AD. However, whether periodontitis triggers an increase in type I interferons in the brain, subsequently inducing AD-like pathology by eliciting the innate immune response of glial cells and activating the IFITM3-Aβ axis, remains unclear. Additionally, the question of whether colonization of Pg in brain induces innate immune in astrocytes and microglia remains unanswered. Methods We assessed the impact of Pg-induced periodontitis on cognitive impairment in C57BL/6J and APP/PS1 mice using behavioral tests. The effects of Periodontitis/Pg on microglia and astrocytes were measured using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and histological staining. Results Pg-induced periodontitis led to cognitive impairment in C57BL/6J mice and exacerbated a cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, Pg-induced periodontitis elevated the levels of interferon (IFN)-β, IFITM3, and Aβ deposition in the brains of both C57BL/6J and APP/PS1 mice. We also identified Pg DNA, glial activation, and the expression of inflammatory mediators in the brain of a Pg-induced periodontitis model. Additionally, our findings confirmed astrocytes as the primary responders to Pg-induced innate immunity and inflammation both in vitro and in vivo. Periodontitis also induces an increase in IFITM3 expression in periodontal tissue, salivary glands. Conclusions We define a previously unidentified link between periodontitis and cognitive decline, and provide new evidence linking oral pathogenic bacteria-induced innate immunity and neuroinflammation to AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline, partly through increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, triggered neuroinflammation, and elevated IFITM3 in glial cells for Aβ deposition. Moreover, periodontitis exacerbates innate immunity and cognitive impairment in AD mice, underscoring the importance of preventive and therapeutic strategies for periodontal disease in AD patients.

        <tr id="Stroke significantly alters microglial immune status beyond the traditional M1/M2 classification. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from the striatum of hemorrhagic, ischemic, and control mice, revealing activation of mitochondrial autophagy and assembly processes after stroke. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis indicated that stroke-associated genes predominantly regulate mitochondrial maintenance, with leucyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (Lars2) markedly upregulated in post-stroke microglia. A distinct microglial subset (Mc) was identified with notably low Lars2 expression. In vitro, Lars2 overexpression enhanced mitochondrial function, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and suppressed Mc marker gene expression. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed Mc as the most interactive microglial subset following stroke, particularly engaging with neurons. Among neuron-Mc signaling pairs, the neurotrophic factor pleiotrophin-syndecan-4 (PTN-SDC4) ligand-receptor pair emerged as a key mediator. Conditioned media from stressed microglia upregulated neuronal Ptn expression, likely recruiting microglia, as exogenous PTN promoted microglial migration. These findings identify Mc as a stroke-induced microglial population with low Lars2 expression and pro-inflammatory features. The lack of compensatory mitochondrial repair in Mc contributes to pro-inflammatory polarization, positioning Lars2 as a mitochondrial checkpoint linking stroke-induced microglial reprogramming to neuroinflammation.">

        <tr id="At least 10% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a variety of multisystem symptoms lasting more than 12 wk known as postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or “long COVID.” While the precise pathogenesis of PASC remains unclear, immune dysregulation is widely recognized as a key factor. Moreover, PASC disproportionately affects older individuals who are prone to age-related immune system decline, which further exacerbates the risk and severity of PASC. The oral cavity, a primary site for initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, may contribute to the development and persistence of PASC. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in age-related oral health, such as periodontitis, salivary gland (SG) dysfunction, and gustatory and olfactory impairments, may create an environment conducive to forming an oral reservoir of intact virus or viral antigens, which may contribute to the chronicity of PASC. Alternatively, the pathogenesis of PASC may increase the risk of a wide range of oral health issues, such as dental diseases, dry mouth, and sensory dysfunction (e.g., taste and smell) that are frequently reported by patients with PASC. This review highlights how aging facilitates oral SARS-CoV-2 infection, co-infection with other viruses may drive PASC in aging patients, aging and PASC dysregulate the oral microbiome, SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes molecular mechanisms involved in oral tissue aging, aging oral health affects susceptibility to developing PASC, and inflammation associated with PASC exacerbates dysregulation of metabolic/enzymatic pathways of aging oral mucosa and diseases of the periodontal apparatus, SGs, and taste. It underscores the urgent need to comprehensively address the interplay between aging oral health and PASC, which will help mitigate long-term complications and improve overall health outcomes for affected individuals.">

        <tr id="Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are the most common intracranial tumors. Evidence suggests that these types of tumors may have high recurrence rates. In this context, the purinergic system, oxidative stress, and inflammation are important signaling pathways involved in the cancer’s pathophysiology. This study aimed to evaluate the sociodemographic and diagnostic profiles, as well as assess the purinergic signaling, immunological, and redox profiles, of patients after PitNET resection. We collected sociodemographic data and the patients’ diagnostic profiles. We also collected blood samples to analyze glycemia, triglycerides, albumin, and ATP levels. The ectonucleotidase activity was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, we evaluated their redox and immunological profiles. There was a prevalence of gonadotropic macroadenoma derived from PIT-1 cells. We found that patients included in the PitNET group had increased glycemia, serum ATP levels, and ATP hydrolysis in PBMCs. Analyzing their immunological profiles, we found that patients had increased levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF, while the IL-27 level was decreased. Regarding their redox profiles, PitNET patients had increased levels of ROS and protein carbonylation. Unexpectedly, patients also showed increased levels of non-protein thiols (NPSHs), total thiols (PSHs), and ascorbic acid. Thus, the dysregulation of purinergic signaling sustained chronic inflammation and oxidative imbalance in PitNET patients for a long time after surgical resection. These data suggest that patients with PitNETs require long-term accompanying to prevent cancer recurrence prognosis. The biomarkers highlighted in this study may be good tools to help the medical approaches.">

        <tr id="Undernutrition remains a major global health crisis, with nearly 1 billion people experiencing severe food insecurity. Malnourished individuals are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases, which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for this population. Despite the known link between undernutrition and infection susceptibility, the mechanisms remain poorly understood, and it is unclear whether refeeding can reverse nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency. Here, we investigate how malnutrition leads to immune dysfunction and the ability of refeeding to repair it. Malnourished mice show an inability to control sublethal Listeria monocytogenes infection, reduced immune cell function and expansion, and early contraction before pathogen clearance. Myelopoiesis is particularly affected, with fewer neutrophils and monocytes present both before and after infection in malnourished mice. While refeeding restores body mass, lymphoid organ cellularity, and T cell responses, refed mice remain susceptible to Listeria infection, revealing that recovery from lymphoid atrophy alone is not sufficient to restore protective immunity. Accordingly, peripheral neutrophils and monocytes fail to fully recover, and emergency myelopoiesis remains impaired in refed animals. Altogether, this work identifies dysregulated myelopoiesis as a link between prior nutritional state and immunocompetency, indicating that food scarcity is an immunologic risk factor, even after nutritional recovery.">

The goal of this study was the comparative evaluation of PNAs in healthy individuals vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), septic patients, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and a pre-pandemic control group from 2019. Methods This observational study involved prospective blood sample collection from vaccinated individuals at separate times after immunization with Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, together with the retrospective analysis of laboratory data from COVID-19, sepsis, and control subjects. PNA ratios and anti-S-protein antibody levels were also measured. Results Following primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, PNA levels increased significantly, showing a gradual decline over six months while remaining elevated. Booster vaccinations did not elevate PNA levels. In COVID-19 patients PNA ratios were the highest, while in the patients with sepsis remained comparable to those of the control group. A moderate correlation was found between PNA and anti-S-protein levels after primary immunization (rho = 0.31, p = 0.0071), but no correlation was observed post-booster. Strong associations between PNA and platelet counts occurred in COVID-19 and sepsis groups, while leukocyte and neutrophil counts showed no significant correlations with PNA. Conclusions The results of this study may support the possibility of using PNA ratio assessment for the evaluation of the immune response.">

        <tr id="Abstract Much progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of white-nose syndrome (WNS), a devastating disease that has impacted North American hibernating bats for nearly two decades. Growth of the causative fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, on exposed epidermal tissue of bats creates an immune reaction that disrupts natural hibernation physiology and leads to premature expenditure of energy reserves and often death. Past work has highlighted the similarities between WNS and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, but other conditions that have not been considered yet may also be relevant. We performed a transcriptomic analysis of wing tissue from naïve and exposed bats to further investigate the implications of observed differential gene expression patterns. For this analysis, we collected wing biopsy samples from 41 individuals prior to WNS emergence and 58 individuals 2–5 years after WNS emergence. We generated poly-A enriched tag-Seq libraries to compare gene expression between these groups. We then linked our findings and those of past studies to other disease systems to build hypotheses regarding mechanisms of WNS pathophysiology. We found an overrepresentation of functions related to programmed cell death and cytokine activity among upregulated genes. Importantly, we also identified upregulation of three S100 damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in exposed populations. Taken together, our findings and those of past studies suggest that infected bats experience a feedback loop of cell death among immune cells, the release of DAMPs and the stimulation of cytokine release that may act to maintain pathological immune activity. This feedback loop likely relates to cytokine storms in individuals with severe infection and possibly deteriorates into sepsis over time. Given the pathophysiology of sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction potentially contributes to the physiological disruption associated with WNS.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: In late 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic called the ‘coronavirus disease 2019’ (COVID-19). After the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, many individuals (up to 33%) complained of unexplained symptoms involving multiple organ systems and were diagnosed as having Long COVID-19 (LC-19). Currently, LC-19 is inadequately defined, requiring the formation of consistent diagnostic parameters to provide a foundation for ongoing and future studies of epidemiology, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and therapy. LC-19 represents a significant burden on multiple levels. The reduced ability of workers to return to work or compromised work efficiency has led to consequences at national, economic, and societal levels by increasing dependence on community services. On a personal scale, the isolation and helplessness caused by the disease and its subsequent impact on the patient’s mental health and quality of life are incalculable. Methods: In this paper, we used Walker and Avants’ eight-step approach to perform a concept analysis of the term “Long COVID-19” and define its impact across these parameters. Results: Using this methodology, we provide an improved definition of LC-19 by connecting the clinical symptomology with previously under-addressed factors, such as mental, psychological, economic, and social effects. This definition of LC-19 features can help improve diagnostic procedures and help plan relevant healthcare services. Conclusions: LC-19 represents a complex and pressing public health challenge with diverse symptomology, an unpredictable timeline, and complex pathophysiology. This concept analysis serves as a tool for improving LC-19 definition, but it remains a dynamic disease with evolving diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, requiring deeper investigation and understanding of its long-term effects.">

Controlling excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production by immune cells remains a significant challenge.

Using bone marrow-derived macrophages and an endotoxemia mouse model, we found that NAT10 is significantly upregulated in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) due to the deubiquitinating enzyme USP39, which stabilizes the NAT10 protein. ac4C RNA sequencing identified ETS2 as a direct target of NAT10, where the ac4C modification enhanced ETS2 mRNA stability and translation, promoting a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages. NAT10 deficiency reduces LPS-induced macrophage activation and cytokine production, improving cardiac function in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of NAT10 using remodelin produced similar protective effects.

        <tr id="Microglia, resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play an essential role in responding to pathological conditions by adopting diverse activation states and morphologies. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed that microglial subtypes were heterogeneous based on their gene expression profiles. However, the mechanism on how morphological changes in microglia are correlated with their gene expression profiles remains unclear. The current study aimed to identify a distinct population of rod-shaped microglia, characterized by an elongated morphology, in glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCLC)-deficient mice, a model of glutathione deficiency-induced oxidative stress. In the process of brain atrophy accompanied by neuronal cell death, which was observed in GCLC-KO mice, the rod-shaped microglia emerged in early stages of neurodegeneration and subsequently decreased in number over time. C1q-mediated synaptic pruning has been implicated in microglial activation under pathological conditions. Thus, whether C1q contributes to the formation of rod-shaped microglia was investigated. Notably, the genetic deletion of C1q did not affect the number or distribution of rod-shaped microglia in GCLC-KO mice. These findings suggest that their formation occurs via a C1q-independent mechanism. According to morphological and molecular analyses, the gene expression profile of the rod-shaped microglia was similar to that of the disease-associated microglia (DAM). To investigate the mechanisms underlying their formation, single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on cortical tissues collected from GCLC-KO mice. DAM-like microglial clusters were consistently identified. Further, pathway enrichment analysis suggested the potential involvement of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA, encoded by Plau) signaling. Considering the role of uPA in extracellular matrix degradation and cell migration, it may contribute to the morphological changes in rod-shaped microglia. In addition, the phosphorylation of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a modification linked to structural plasticity, increased in rod-shaped microglia. Based on these findings, uPA signaling and phosphorylated GAP43 may be involved in microglial elongation and alignment along neuronal fibers, which potentially facilitate their migration during early neurodegenerative responses. Taken together, the rod-shaped microglia are a previously unrecognized activated population that emerges early in neurodegeneration and may be involved in disease-related processes. Understanding their molecular regulation can provide insights into early microglial responses and potential therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="Respiratory infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus pose significant global health challenges, leading to high morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations. Despite their distinct virological characteristics, these viruses exploit host cellular metabolism to support replication, modulate immune responses, and promote disease progression. Emerging evidence shows that they induce metabolic reprogramming, shifting cellular energy production toward glycolysis to meet the bioenergetic demands of viral replication. Additionally, alterations in lipid metabolism, including enhanced fatty acid synthesis and disrupted cholesterol homeostasis, facilitate viral entry, replication, and immune evasion. The dysregulation of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress pathways also contributes to disease severity and long-term complications, such as persistent inflammation and immune exhaustion. Understanding these metabolic shifts is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers for early disease detection, prognosis, and patient stratification. This review provides an overview of the metabolic alterations induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus, highlighting shared and virus-specific mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the exacerbation of disease progression of both COVID-19 and HIV when coexisting. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between these two viruses are still poorly understood. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive analysis of single-cell transcriptomics to identify and characterize peripheral blood cell subsets in COVID-19 and HIV-infected patients. Our findings revealed that COVID-19 and HIV exhibit a partially similar cellular composition and cell cycle distribution. Additionally, we identified a common pathogenesis in B-cell subsets of COVID-19 and HIV patients, which showed abnormal activation states of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Based on B-cell signature genes and UPR-related genes, we developed a machine learning diagnostic model that can accurately diagnose both COVID-19 and HIV infections. Our model was validated using a large number of bulk transcriptome data sets and showed good clinical efficacy. Our study provides molecular insights into the single-cell level interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infections, suggesting a possible common disease mechanism that warrants further investigation.">

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke, characterized by high clinical mortality and poor prognosis, has been prioritized by the World Health Organization (WHO) for reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases. However, the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke remains complex and poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed the infiltration of γδ T cells within ischemic stroke lesions, accompanied by the upregulation of IL-17, IL-23, and other inflammatory cytokines, suggesting their involvement in the stroke’s pathological process. Literature indicates that γδ T cells are recruited to the lesion site by microglia-derived chemokines and subsequently infiltrate the damaged brain tissue. This review summarizes current knowledge on the precise mechanisms underlying γδ T cell activation, migration, and ensuing immune-inflammatory responses in neuroinflammation, as well as their role in the progression of ischemic stroke. It further discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting γδ T cells to modulate neuroinflammation for ischemic stroke treatment, thereby offering novel therapeutic targets for managing neuroinflammation in this condition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aging is a complex biological process that significantly impacts the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes, critical support cells in the brain, undergo senescence with age, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases. While previous studies have utilized murine models to investigate astrocyte senescence, human astrocytes offer a more physiologically relevant system to study age‐related neurodegenerative changes. This study presents a novel protocol for inducing senescence in both human primary and murine astrocytes using a combination of cellular stressors, such as lactacystin, H2O2, rotenone, and doxorubicin. Our results demonstrate that doxorubicin treatment effectively induces a robust senescent phenotype in both human and murine astrocytes, characterized by increased expression of senescence markers such as p21 and β‐galactosidase, along with activation of the DNA damage response (γ‐H2AX and 53BP1). Doxorubicin treatment increased nuclear size and induced cell cycle arrest in astrocytes, as revealed by reduced BrdU incorporation and decreased cell density, without inducing cytotoxic effects. This phenotype is accompanied by a pronounced pro‐inflammatory profile, with elevated expression of cytokines including MMP3, IL‐6, and IL‐1β, indicative of a strong senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These findings provide a novel in vitro model for murine and human astrocyte senescence induced by doxorubicin, highlighting its relevance for studying mechanisms underlying age‐related neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. By establishing a robust model of human astrocyte senescence, this study provides a valuable tool for exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving age‐related neurodegenerative processes, serving as an alternative approach to traditional murine models.">

        <tr id="Background Viral pneumonia is the most common and lethal pandemic disease, but there are no broad-spectrum antiviral drugs with high genetic barriers to resistance. To elucidate the mechanisms of viral pneumonia progression and potential targets for its treatment. Methods Viral pneumonia models were induced by the PR8 virus strain in wild-type (WT) and STING knockout (STING-KO) mice. Series of molecular biology techniques were used to evaluate the severity of pneumonia and cytokine levels. Results In this study, STING (stimulator of interferon genes) was activated in the lungs of virus-infected mice, leading to cytokine production and amplification of the immune response, thereby causing rapid deterioration of symptoms. Furthermore, excessive activation of innate immune response via STING was prevented by a STING inhibitor (C-176), which significantly reduced viral lung inflammation. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was similarly suppressed during viral pneumonia treatment with STING inhibitors (C-176), and NETs formation and STING expression were positively correlated, indicating that STING plays an important role in NETs formation. Symptoms of pneumonia in STING-KO mice infected with PR8 were significantly milder than those in WT mice, and NETs were less likely to form in the lung tissue of STING-KO mice. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed that STING-mediated regulation of NETs may be associated with gasdermin D (GSDMD), and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that STING, GSDMD, and NETs-related proteins interact with each other. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that in neutrophils from WT mice, STING and GSDMD were colocalized on the membrane after viral infection, whereas in neutrophils from STING-KO mice, GSDMD expression was decreased after exposure to the virus. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that targeted intervention with STING alleviated pneumonia by inhibiting inflammation and NETs formation. The study also revealed that blocking STING could inhibit the activation of GSDMD to inhibit NETs formation, slowing the progression of viral pneumonia.">

Here, we observe increased MPXV replication, more extensive skin lesions, and impaired humoral and cellular immune responses in SIV-MPXV co-infected rhesus macaques compared to those infected with MPXV alone. Multi-organ proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses reveals upregulation of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory pathways in skin lesions and across multiple organs, especially in immune-related tissues. Abnormal activation of DNA replication and cell cycle signaling pathways, which may contribute to enhanced viral replication, is evident in both MPXV and SIV-MPXV co-infected groups. CDK4/6 may present a potential therapeutic target to suppress MPXV replication.

        <tr id="Infiltrating monocytes can exert both protective and pathogenic effects during central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. However, the metabolic mechanisms that govern these divergent roles remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and metabolic flow analysis of brain and bone marrow (BM) is used to map the metabolic signatures of monocyte-derived cells (MCs) during lethal West Nile virus encephalitis. Trajectory analysis shows that BM monocytes progress through three metabolic profiles before migrating to the brain and differentiating into a pro-inflammatory HIF1-α⁺ MC population. This population further diverges into an inflammatory, iNOS⁺ MC subset with high glycolysis and amino acid metabolism, and a protective, glycolytically quiescent, antigen-presenting MC subset. Daily in vivo glycolysis inhibition reduces neuroinflammation and disease signs without increasing viral load. This effect does not reflect a broad reduction in myelopoiesis but rather a selective decrease in iNOS⁺ MC migration, revealing distinct glycolytic dependencies among MC subsets. HIF1-α activity remains independent of glycolysis, enabling functional differentiation of antigen-presenting MCs without impairing antiviral responses by cervical lymph node T cells. This study identifies key metabolic drivers of MC function in viral CNS disease, in which selective metabolic reprogramming reduces severe neuroinflammation, demonstrating a promising therapeutic strategy.">

        <tr id="Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is the leading cause of neurodevelopmental disorders in children, including nongenetic sensorineural hearing loss. Previous studies have shown that HCMV immediate early 1 (IE1) protein, also known as IE72, contributes to brain maldevelopment. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear due to the strict species specificity of cytomegaloviruses (CMVs), limiting animal model study. In the current study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to construct a transgenic mouse model (Rosa26-LSL-IE1+/−, Camk2ɑ-Cre) specifically and stably expressing IE1 protein in brain. These transgenic mice exhibited impaired spatial working memory, hippocampal neurodegeneration, and proinflammatory activation of brain microglia and astrocytes. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that IE1 protein upregulated genes linked to metabolism and downregulated genes implicated in nervous system development. Furthermore, IE1 alters the lactate production pathway in astrocytes, thereby reducing the energy supply available to neurons. These findings suggest that long-term IE1 protein expression disrupts neurodevelopment by inducing neuroinflammation and uncoupling neurons from metabolic support by astrocytes. These results provide a clear molecular mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders in infants with congenital HCMV infection.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a key role in the development of CNS pathologies. This event encompasses a series of mechanisms involving the immune system and its cellular and molecular components. While it is necessary to activate the innate immune system during the early response to pathogens or traumas, persistent inflammation hinders neuronal recovery and contributes to the development of long-term neuronal complications. In this way, the application of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments is crucial to achieving better recovery of patients. We recently observed that the application of a low frequency electromagnetic field (EMF) decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in an animal model of Traumatic Brain Injury in swine. To characterize this effect in terms of individualized response of neurons and microglial cells, we performed an in vitro model of pro-inflammatory damage by treating two different cell lines with tumor necrosis factor-α and then stimulating the cells with two frequencies of EMF. Transcriptional expression of inflammatory mediators was analyzed 24 and 48 hours after. Our results showed that both cell lines are susceptible to EMF, responding to the treatment by reducing the levels of the target genes in study. These observations further support the anti-inflammatory effect of EMF in the function of neurons and microglial cells and thus enhancing the recovery following traumatic brain injury, as observed under in vivo conditions in both experimental animals and human. These findings lay the foundation and warrants further preclinical and clinical studies to determine the effective frequency and duration of EMF stimulation in the healing of brain injury.">

        <tr id="Introduction Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) has emerged as a major health concern, affecting approximately 3.0-11.7% of infected individuals. While neuropsychiatric symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbances dominate the clinical picture, recent evidence suggests a pivotal role for immune dysregulation in the pathophysiology of PCS. This study aimed to analyze the clinical course and laboratory features of patients with PCS. Methods In this retrospective single-center study, 74 patients with PCS were evaluated between November 2020 and June 2022 at the Department of Neurology, University Hospital Bern. Clinical assessments included standardized questionnaires [Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Scale of Motor and Cognitive Function (FSMC), Beck Depression Index II (BDI-II), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)] and laboratory investigations at two timepoints. Particular focus was placed on immune-related biomarkers, including ferritin and antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Results Fatigue, sleep disturbances, and pain were the most frequently reported symptoms. At follow-up (a mean duration of 14.4 weeks after the first consultation), both symptom burden and severity scores decreased significantly. Nevertheless, 82.4% of patients continued to report fatigue. Elevated ferritin levels were found in 78.1% of tested patients (mean: 306.9 µg/l), and ANA titres ≥1:160 were observed in 40% of patients without known autoimmune disease. At follow-up, 80% of patients with initially elevated ferritin and 68% with elevated ANA remained above normal thresholds, suggesting ongoing immune activation. Conclusions While symptom burden declined over time, most PCS patients continued to experience clinically relevant symptoms. The persistence of elevated ferritin and ANA levels underscores possible immune dysregulation and highlights the potential of these biomarkers in characterizing PCS. These findings underline the need for further studies investigating their diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.">

        <tr id="Introduction Preterm hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (pHIE) is a complex brain injury that contributes to chronic neural inflammation and neurological disorders. The signs and symptoms of in utero pHIE can often be overlooked, untreated or lumped into more generic conditions such as encephalopathy of prematurity (EOP). Clinical interventions like hypothermia and erythropoietin do not improve pHIE. We characterized a murine model for pHIE, which includes hypoxia and maternal factors as a cost-effective alternative to large animal models of HIE. Methods We injected pregnant mouse dams with LPS to stimulate an inflammatory response on embryonic days 15–16 (E15–E16), and whole cage hypoxia exposures occurred from postnatal days 3 to 9. To quantify the development of inflammation in the pHIE model, we used immunohistochemistry to stain for Caspase-9 in the cortex (20 μm per slice) and then counted Caspase-9 positive cells using unbiased stereology. We stained brain tissue with MAP2 to quantify neuronal intermediate filament expression and staining using a machine-learning based image analysis approach. We quantified cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18 and TNF-α) using RT-qPCR and (IL-18) ELISA to characterize differential expression in all treatment groups. The pHIE animals were compared with controls (LPS-Normoxia, Saline-Hypoxia, Saline-Normoxia, and Naïve) and with a model of only hypoxia (10% O2) exposure in mouse pups. Results The pHIE pups showed significantly higher expression of Caspase-9 throughout the cortex compared to Naïve pup brains (p < 0.05). MAP2 expression was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) between 1.5–6.0 mm of the brain compared to Saline-Hypoxia and Naïve animals. Both IL-1β and IL-10 expression in LPS-Hypoxia animals was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in Saline-Hypoxia and Naive animals. TNF-α expression was not significantly different between LPS-Hypoxia and Saline-Hypoxia animals. However, both showed significantly different transcription, compared to Naive animals. Discussion The model we describe here shows cortical damage similar to that seen in human HIE.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Antiretroviral therapy is effective in controlling viral load, but there is immediate rebound of virus when treatment is interrupted. This is due to a reservoir of cells harboring HIV which evades immune surveillance and persists in the host. In this review we discuss research leveraging single-cell transcriptomics to examine single-cells from people living with HIV in vivo that can provide insight into these reservoir cells.


RECENT FINDINGS
Advancements in the field of multiomics, specifically single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), have enabled the profiling of hundreds of thousands of single cells and characterized the heterogeneity of cells in people with HIV. Studies in cohorts of people treated during acute HIV-1 infection have revealed longitudinal changes in immune responses during early infection, discovered novel restriction and latency factors, and identified markers of the cells with virus and the reservoir size.


SUMMARY
Single-cell transcriptomics is a powerful technology that screens the entire transcriptome of an individual cell. When used strategically to investigate samples from cohorts of acute HIV-1 infection, this unbiased omics tool can shed light on the elusive HIV-1 reservoir and unlock strategies for cure.">

        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Myocarditis, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, can have multiple etiologies, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or, rarely, mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on left ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from patients with myocarditis unrelated to COVID-19 (Non-COVID-19), after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Post-COVID-19) and after COVID-19 vaccination (Post-Vaccination). We identified distinct cytokine expression patterns, with interferon-γ playing a key role in Post-COVID-19, and upregulated IL16 and IL18 expression serving as a hallmark of Post-Vaccination myocarditis. Although myeloid responses were similar across all groups, the Post-Vaccination group showed a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells, and the Post-COVID-19 group exhibited an expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T and natural killer cells. Endothelial cells showed gene expression changes indicative of vascular barrier dysfunction in the Post-COVID-19 group and ongoing angiogenesis across all groups. These findings highlight shared and distinct mechanisms driving myocarditis in patients with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T-cells are essential for controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet their antigen-specific resolution in relation to disease severity, functional dynamics during acute infection, and long-term memory formation remain incompletely understood. Using comprehensive longitudinal profiling of 553 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic antigens across globally prevalent HLAs, we identified antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses that were either critical for early viral clearance or associated with severe disease outcomes. During acute infection, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a broader and more robust CD8+ T-cell response than those with mild disease. Notably, we identified HLA-A1-restricted immunodominant antigen-specific T-cells strongly associated with severe disease. These T-cells were present at extremely high frequencies but showed significantly reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules at both the transcriptomic (PRF1, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY) and protein levels (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2), as revealed by multidimensional single-cell and cytokine profiling. In contrast, patients with mild disease had T-cells that recognized a more restricted set of antigens, showed only partial overlap with those in severe cases, and showed enhanced cytotoxicity, along with enrichment in gene sets associated with cytotoxic function, hypoxia, and glycolysis. Furthermore, the long-term memory CD8+ T-cells were maintained for a limited subset of immunodominant antigens, with their persistence correlating with their initial frequency during infection. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following infection expanded the long-term T-cell repertoire by enhancing pre-existing responses and generating de novo responses, regardless of prior disease severity. These findings resolve the antigen-specific kinetics and durability of CD8+ T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide key insights into their functional landscape. This knowledge could inform future vaccine strategies and therapeutic interventions to enhance protective immunity against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="Cerebral organoids (COs) are valuable tools for studying the intricate interplay between glial cells and neurons in brain development and disease, including HIV-associated neuroinflammation. We developed a novel approach to generate microglia containing COs (CO-iMs) by co-culturing hematopoietic progenitors and inducing pluripotent stem cells. This approach allowed for the differentiation of microglia within the organoids concomitantly with the neuronal progenitors. Compared with conventional COs, CO-iMs were more efficient at generating CD45+/CD11b+/Iba-1+ microglia and presented a physiologically relevant proportion of microglia (~ 7%). CO-iMs presented substantially increased expression of microglial homeostatic and sensome markers as well as markers for the complement cascade. CO-iMs are susceptible to HIV infection, resulting in a significant increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, which are abrogated by the addition of antiretrovirals. Thus, CO-iM is a robust model for deciphering neuropathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and viral infections of brain cells in a 3D culture system.

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak revealed the susceptibility of elderly patients to respiratory virus infections, showing cell senescence or subclinical persistent inflammatory profiles and favoring the development of severe pneumonia. Methods In our study, we evaluated the potential influence of lung aging on the efficiency of replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as determining the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of the distal lung tissue. Results Using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from donors of different ages, we found that pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 IAV replicated in the lung parenchyma with high efficacy. In contrast to these IAV strains, SARS-CoV-2 Early isolate and Delta variant of concern (VOC) replicated less efficiently in PCLS. Interestingly, both viruses showed reduced replication in PCLS from older compared to younger donors, suggesting that aged lung tissue represents a suboptimal environment for viral replication. Regardless of the age-dependent viral loads, PCLS responded to H5N1 IAV infection by an induction of IL-6 and IP10/CXCL10, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and to H1N1 IAV infection by induction of IP10/CXCL10 mRNA. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 IAV infection were not causing detectable cell death, H5N1 IAV infection led to more cytotoxicity and induced significant early interferon responses. Conclusions In summary, our findings suggest that aged lung tissue might not favor viral dissemination, pointing to a determinant role of dysregulated immune mechanisms in the development of severe disease.

        <tr id="Background Dengue encephalitis, a severe neurological complication of dengue virus infection, is increasingly recognized for its rising incidence and significant public health burden. Despite its growing prevalence, the underlying mechanisms and effective therapeutic strategies remain poorly understood. Methods Cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis was determined by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Viral load of dengue virus and the level of cytokines expression was detected by RT-qPCR. The target cells of dengue virus were verified by immunofluorescence. The cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cell was determined by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion, adoptive transfer and CCK-8-based cell viability assay. Axonal and synaptic reduction induced by dengue virus infection was demonstrated by RT-qPCR, Western blot, transmission electron microscope and immunofluorescence. Finally, motor and sensory functions of mice were detected by open field test and hot plate test, respectively. Results In this study, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing on brain tissues from a dengue-infected murine model to construct a comprehensive cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis. Our findings identify neurons, particularly inhibitory GABAergic subtypes, as the primary targets of dengue virus. Additionally, immune cell infiltration was observed, contributing to significant neurological damage. Comprehensive analyses of cell-cell communication, combined with CD8+ T cell depletion and transfer restoration experiments, have elucidated the critical role of CD8+ T cells in triggering encephalitis through their interaction with neurons. These cells infiltrate the brain from peripheral circulation, interact with neurons, and induce damage of synapse and axon, accompanied by neurological dysfunction. Conclusion We defined cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis in mouse model and identified the primary target neuron of dengue virus. In addition, we demonstrated the significant cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cell, which leads to apoptosis of neuron and neurological dysfunction of mice. Our study provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding dengue encephalitis through advanced sequencing technologies. The insights gained serve as a foundation for future investigations into its pathogenesis and the development of targeted therapeutic approaches.

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses are the most common cause of infectious encephalitis and highly target neurons for infection. Our understanding of the intrinsic capacity of neuronal innate immune responses to mediate protective antiviral responses remains incomplete. Here, we evaluated the role of intercellular crosstalk in mediating intrinsic neuronal immunity and its contribution to limiting viral infection. We found that in the absence of viral antagonism, neurons transcriptionally induce robust interferon signaling and can effectively signal to uninfected bystander neurons. Yet, in two-dimensional cultures, this dynamic response did not restrict viral spread. Interestingly, this differed in the context of viral infection in three-dimensional forebrain organoids with complex neuronal subtypes and cellular organization, where we observed protective capacity. We showed antiviral crosstalk between infected neurons and bystander neural progenitors is mediated by type I interferon signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we then uncovered regions containing bystander neural progenitors that expressed distinct antiviral genes, revealing critical underpinnings of protective antiviral responses among neuronal subtypes. These findings underscore the importance of interneuronal communication in protective antiviral immunity in the brain and implicate key contributions to protective antiviral signaling.

        <tr id="Common neurological symptoms of COVID-19, such as anosmia, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction, depend on interactions between the peripheral and central nervous systems. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections. Highlights iPSC technology was employed to generate peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a valuable platform for studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on peripheral sensory neurons. Our findings demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant exerted both direct and indirect effects on peripheral sensory neurons. Virus exposure upregulated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in peripherin-positive neurons. Additionally, exposure to the virus or its S1 spike protein increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression and trafficking, leading to axonal degeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that BA.5 exposure enhanced cAMP signaling pathway, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels that led to the significantly damage on synapses and axon guidance. The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited TRPV1 activation and mitigated axonal damage, offering neuroprotective effects for sensory neurons exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

Among healthy children and adolescents, younger age is associated with higher URT expression of innate and adaptive immune pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces broad upregulation of URT innate and adaptive immune responses among children and adolescents. Peripheral blood responses among SARS-CoV-2-infected children and adolescents are dominated by interferon pathways, while upregulation of myeloid activation, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways is observed only in adults. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, fever is associated with blunted URT immune responses and more pronounced systemic immune activation.

We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in relation to antibodies, infection outcome and disease severity and assessed its durability in a longitudinal cohort over a three-year time course. We identified pre-existing T cells reactive to the seasonal coronavirus (CoV) OC43 that cross-react with the conserved SARS-CoV-2 spike S813-829 peptide. These cross-reactive T cells increased in frequency following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and correlated with enhanced spike-specific T cell responses and significantly reduced viral loads. Furthermore, our data revealed that CoV-cross-reactive T cells were maintained as part of the long-lasting memory response, contributing to increased T cell frequencies against omicron variants. These findings suggest a functional role of CoV-cross-reactive T cells that extends beyond the initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, contributing to enhanced immunity against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Type III interferons (IFNs) primarily act on epithelial cells and protect against virus infection of the mucosa, whereas type I IFNs act more systemically. To date, it has been unknown which epithelial subtypes in the upper airways, the primary site for initial infection for most respiratory viruses, primarily rely on type III IFN or type I IFNs for antiviral protection. To address this question, we performed a single-cell transcriptomics analysis of the epithelial IFN-mediated response focusing on the upper airways of mice. This work identified nine distinct cell types derived from the olfactory epithelium and thirteen distinct cell types from the respiratory epithelium. Interestingly, type I IFNs induced a stronger antiviral transcriptional response than type III IFN in respiratory epithelial cells, whereas in olfactory epithelial cells, including sustentacular (SUS) and Bowman’s gland cells (BGC), type III IFN was more dominant compared to type I IFN. SUS and BGC, which provide structural support and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, were highly susceptible to infection with a mouse-adapted variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA20) but were protected against infection if the animals were prophylactically treated with type III IFN. These findings demonstrate a high degree of cell type heterogeneity in terms of interferon-mediated antiviral responses and reveal a potent role for type III IFNs in protecting the olfactory epithelium. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 infects SUS and BGC in the olfactory epithelium, causing an impairment of structural support and integrity of olfactory sensory neurons that can result in severe olfactory dysfunctions. We observed an unexpected compartmentalization of the IFN-mediated transcriptional response within the airway epithelium, and we found that olfactory epithelial cells preferentially respond to type III IFN, which resulted in robust antiviral protection of SUS and BGC. Given the proximity of the olfactory epithelium to the central nervous system, we hypothesize that evolution favored a type III IFN-biased antiviral immune response in this tissue to limit inflammatory responses in the brain. Cell type-specific antiviral responses in the upper airways, triggered by the different types of IFNs, should be investigated in more detail and carefully taken into consideration during the development of IFN-based antivirals for clinical use.">

        <tr id="Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities, making the advanced age as a major predictor of disease severity. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms explaining how old age represents a major risk factor remain elusive. To investigate this, we compared SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15–22 months) mice. Both groups of K18-ACE2 mice were intranasally infected with 500 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with analyses performed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infection (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, lung RNA-seq, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable differences, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance, reduced survival, and failure to recover weight loss due to infection. RNA-seq data suggested greater lung damage and reduced respiratory function in infected aged mice. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient antiviral response characterized by reduced Th1-associated mediators (IFNγ, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9) and diminished number of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. These findings indicate that aging affects antiviral immunity, leading to prolonged infection, greater lung damage, and poorer clinical outcomes. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.

        <tr id="The spatial organization of adaptive immune cells within lymph nodes is critical for understanding immune responses during infection and disease. Here, we introduce AIR-SPACE, an integrative approach that combines high-resolution spatial transcriptomics with paired, high-fidelity long-read sequencing of T and B cell receptors. This method enables the simultaneous analysis of cellular transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires within their native spatial context. We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated sub-anatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs. Overall, our study demonstrates how AIR-SPACE can be used to gain insight into the spatial dynamics of infection responses within lymphoid organs.">

        <tr id="The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it critical to understand the immune and inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It became increasingly recognized that the immune response was a key mediator of illness severity and that its mechanisms needed to be better understood. Early infection of both tissue and immune cells, such as macrophages, leading to pyroptosis-mediated inflammasome production in an organ system critical for systemic oxygenation likely plays a central role in the morbidity wrought by SARS-CoV-2. Delayed transcription of Type I and Type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to early disinhibition of viral replication. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), some of which may be produced through mechanisms involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), likely contribute to the hyperinflammatory state in patients with severe COVID-19. Lymphopenia, more apparent among natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells, can contribute to disease severity and may reflect direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 or end-organ sequestration. Direct infection and immune activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may be a critical mechanism through which end-organ systems are impacted. In this context, endovascular neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and microthrombi development can be seen in the lungs and other critical organs throughout the body, such as the heart, gut, and brain. The kidney may be among the most impacted extrapulmonary organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to a high concentration of ACE2 and exposure to systemic SARS-CoV-2. In the kidney, acute tubular injury, early myofibroblast activation, and collapsing glomerulopathy in select populations likely account for COVID-19-related AKI and CKD development. The development of COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), in particular, may be mediated through IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suggesting a direct connection between the COVID-19-related immune response and the development of chronic disease. Chronic manifestations of COVID-19 also include systemic conditions like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which may reflect a spectrum of clinical presentations of persistent immune dysregulation. The lessons learned and those undergoing continued study likely have broad implications for understanding viral infections’ immunologic and inflammatory consequences beyond coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

Here, we present high-resolution spatial transcriptomics of 40 postmortem brain samples from patients with Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and severe COVID-19. Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer-and region-specificity. In Parkinson’s disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance. COVID-19 brains displayed extensive peripheral immune cell infiltration, particularly in the subcortical white matter, accompanied by compromised blood-brain barrier and coordinated neuroinflammatory responses from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Integration of miRNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics uncovered layer-specific regulatory patterns, including neuroinflammation-associated miR-155. This atlas provides unprecedented insights into disease pathology and highlights the critical importance of spatial molecular context in understanding brain disorders.

        <tr id="Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis, with a fatality rate of 20-50% in treated individuals. Although corticosteroid therapy can increase survival in HIV-negative people with TBM, better antimicrobial and host-directed therapies are required to improve outcome. There is, therefore, a need to better understand local immunopathologic pathways. Despite its power in identifying disease-specific cellular profiles, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been underutilized in cerebral samples in brain infection. We employed scRNA-seq to analyze fresh pretreatment cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from four TBM patients, along with paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). While 29 cell subtypes were present in both tissues, their relative abundance varied significantly. In particular, CSF was enriched with highly inflammatory microglia-like macrophages, GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells, and CD56bright NK cells. The latter two subsets exhibited features associated with dysfunctional cytotoxicity. Across multiple cell types, inflammatory signaling pathways were increased and oxidative phosphorylation was decreased in CSF compared to PBMCs. This study highlights the value of scRNA-seq for exploring CSF immunopathogenesis in TBM patients and offers a resource for future studies investigating the pathophysiology of TBM and other brain infections, including potentially targetable cell populations linked with immune-mediated pathology.">

        <tr id="Bona fide Kupffer cells (KCs) are prenatally seeded and show unique functional and immunophenotypic features among tissue macrophages. They are considered as terminally differentiated, and adaptability in disease is attributed to recruited, monocyte-derived KCs. Here, we investigated the extent of KC plasticity and the impact of origin in mycobacterial infections that target macrophages and can persist for months. Fate-mapping combined with high-resolution imaging revealed the emergence of a unique, infection specific KC subset which downregulated the signature markers CLEC4F and VSIG4 (“KClow”). KClow were derived from bona fide KCs and located exclusively to granuloma cores. In contrast, monocyte-derived macrophages were contained at the granuloma borders and contributed to this tissue reaction. ATAC and single-cell RNA sequencing identified a specific signature of KClow with high antimycobacterial activity and specialization to a hypoxic microenvironment. Despite their fundamental deviation from the classical KC phenotype, KClow showed remarkable adaptability, and were capable to return to a homeostatic-like KC state. Accordingly, mycobacterial infections unmask KCs as highly plastic cells, capable of responding to extreme environmental changes.">

        <tr id="Introduction Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis, responding to injury, and modulating neuroinflammation. However, the limitations of rodent models in accurately representing human microglia have posed significant challenges in the study of retinal diseases. Methods PLX5622 was used to eliminate endogenous microglia in mice through oral and intraperitoneal administration, followed by transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (hiPSC-microglia, iMG) into retinal explants to create a novel ex vivo chimeric model containing xenotransplanted microglia (xMG). The number and proportion of xMG in the retina were quantified using retinal flat-mounting and immunostaining. To evaluate the proliferative capacity and synaptic pruning ability of xMG, the expression of Ki-67 and the phagocytosis of synaptic proteins SV2 and PSD95 was assessed. The chimeric model was stimulated with LPS, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze transcriptomic changes in iMG and xMG. Mouse IL-34 antibody neutralization experiments were performed, and the behavior of xMG in retinal degenerative Pde6b−/− mice was examined. Results We demonstrated that xenotransplanted microglia (xMG) successfully migrated to and localized within the mouse retina, adopting homeostatic morphologies. Our approach achieved over 86% integration of human microglia, which maintained key functions including proliferation, immune responsiveness, and synaptic pruning over a 14-day culture period. scRNA-seq of xMG revealed a shift in microglial signatures compared to monoculture iMG, indicating a transition to a more in vivo-like phenotype. In retinal degenerative Pde6b−/− mice, xMG exhibited activation and migrated toward degenerated photoreceptors. Conclusion This model provides a powerful platform for studying human microglia in the retinal context, offering significant insights for advancing research into retinal degenerative diseases and developing potential therapeutic strategies. Future applications of this model include using patient-derived iPSCs to investigate disease-specific microglial behaviors, thereby enhancing our understanding of microglia-related pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Background Viral myocarditis (VMC) is an inflammatory myocardial condition triggered by viral infections which involves pathogenic-related damage and immune-mediated damage. However, the precise immunopathogenic mechanisms underlying VMC remain elusive. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on mouse hearts during the acute phase of CVB3-induced VMC. After manually annotating cell types, functional analyses of macrophage were performed by cell ratio changes, customized gene set module scoring and CellPhoneDB. Utilizing indirect co-culture experiments in vitro, the effects of macrophage-derived SPP1 on cardiac fibroblasts were investigated. Depletion of macrophages and inhibition of SPP1 expression in mice were carried out to study the effects of macrophage-derived SPP1 on cardiac function, inflammation levels, and myocardial injury in mice with VMC. Results Our data revealed that macrophages are the major immune cells which infiltrate the heart during the acute phase of VMC, particularly a macrophage subpopulation which highly expresses Spp1 (Spp1+ macrophages) and exhibited characteristics of peripheral blood monocytes. Spp1+ macrophages communicate extensively with fibroblasts during VMC, and that SPP1 promotes fibroblast conversion to an inflammatory phenotype with high Ccl2/Ccl7 expression. This in turn increases monocyte chemotaxis to the heart. Besides, a partial depletion of macrophages in the early stages of VMC attenuated myocardial inflammation and myocardial injury in mice. Inhibition of SPP1 reduced cardiac macrophage infiltration, attenuated myocardial inflammation, and improved cardiac function in VMC mice. Conclusion Our findings suggested that Spp1+ macrophages could self-recruit, and macrophage-derived SPP1 exacerbated myocardial immune injury by promoting high Ccl2/Ccl7 expression in fibroblasts. Our study advances understandings of VMC pathogenesis, and provides novel insight into potential immunotherapies for VMC.

        <tr id="Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a principal environmental risk factor contributing to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and can be causally linked to ASD symptoms. In our study, we found that MIA triggered by poly (I: C) injection caused ventriculomegaly in offspring due to the dysfunction of the choroid plexus (Chp) and ependyma. We subsequently identified a sustained enhancement of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling in the brain and serum of MIA offspring. Further study revealed that increased IFN-γ signaling could disrupt the barrier function of Chp epithelial cells by activating macrophages, and suppress the differentiation of primary ependymal cells via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/3 signaling. The effects of MIA on the offspring were mitigated by administration of IFNGR-blocking antibody in pregnant dams, while systemic maternal administration of IFN-γ was sufficient to mimic the effect of MIA. Overall, our findings revealed that ventriculomegaly caused by IFN-γ signaling could be a critical factor in compromising fetal brain development in MIA-induced ASD and provide a mechanistic framework for the association between maternal inflammation and abnormal development of ventricles in the offspring.

        <tr id="The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is highly heterogeneous, with interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression playing a dual role in antiviral defense and immune dysregulation. To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is a complex and multifaceted clinical challenge requiring to emphasize its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This study assessed hundreds of virological, serological, immunological, and tissue damage biomarkers in two patient cohorts who experienced mild (n=270) or severe (n=188) COVID-19, 6 to 9 months post-initial infection, and in which 40% and 57.4% of patients, respectively, developed PASC. Blood analysis showed that mains differences observed in humoral, viral, and biological biomarkers were associated with the initial COVID-19 severity, rather than being specifically linked to PASC. However, patients with PASC displayed altered CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell subsets, with higher cytokine-secreting cells and increased terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector memory T cells (TEMRA). Elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells responsive to nucleocapsid/membrane proteins with a TEMRA phenotype were also observed. A random forest model identified these features and initial symptom duration as top variables discriminating PASC, achieving over 80% classification accuracy. Highlights Nine months post-initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, over 40% of patients developed PASC Regardless of PASC, the initial disease form influenced the main immune differences PASC led to altered memory T-cell subsets with elevated TEMRA phenotype PASC presence is associated with disease form, initial symptom count and duration">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism implicated in cardiac infection in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible.">

        <tr id="HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) cause significant dysfunction among people living with HIV. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system and are readily infected by HIV. Microglia are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HAND. In order to identify pathways that may contribute to neuropathogenesis in HAND, we infected induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) with HIV and defined gene expression changes over an 8-day period. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were studied in parallel in order to identify common pathways stimulated in myeloid cells versus the unique aspects of microglia infection. Infection of iMG led to the induction of a robust early inflammatory response triggered within hours of infection, a pattern that differed significantly from that seen in MDMs. Remarkably, gene expression changes in iMG reproduced many of the characteristic genetic signatures previously identified in brain tissues obtained from individuals clinically diagnosed with HAND. Inflammatory activation representing interferon-mediated signaling, TNF/NF-κB, and IL-6/JAK/STAT pathways were particularly prominent over the time course of infection. Interferon-mediated signaling led to enhanced expression of multiple HIV restriction factors, yet viral replication in iMG remained robust. These findings suggest that HIV infection of microglia is the key cellular driver of neuroinflammation in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals. Further studies of infected microglia are likely to aid in understanding the pathogenesis of HAND and in evaluating therapeutic strategies to limit or eliminate HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. Author Summary Persons living with HIV frequently develop debilitating problems with brain function that are collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Treatment with antiretroviral drugs to control HIV has largely eliminated the most severe form of HIV-related brain dysfunction, HIV encephalitis, but a significant proportion of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiviral therapy still develop significant problems with cognitive function. Microglia are the major macrophage-like cells of the brain and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Inflammation in the brain following infection contributes to damage to neurons and is the likely source of decline of brain function. This study used microglia that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, termed iMG, to study the kinetics of gene expression changes in HIV-infected microglia, and compared those changes to those seen in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). iMG were found to be easily infected with a macrophage-tropic HIV strain and exhibited a rapid increase in gene expression associated with inflammatory signaling through interferon- and tumor necrosis factor/NF-kappa B-mediated pathways. Remarkably, the patterns of gene expression in microglia strongly overlapped with gene expression signatures derived from brain tissue samples of HIV patients with HAND. The rapid onset and magnitude of inflammation as well as induction of specific HIV restriction factors differed from that seen in infected macrophages/MDMs. These studies reinforce the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of HAND and provide insights into HIV-microglia interactions that can help direct interventions to reduce inflammation and preserve brain function.">

        <tr id="Introduction Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing immune responses against pathogens. The fluctuation of Treg proportions in COVID-19 remains a topic of debate, and the mechanisms triggering Treg activation in COVID-19 are still unclear. Understanding these issues is essential for better managing immune responses in COVID-19 patients. Methods We collected a cohort of COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity and stage to explore the transcriptomic and functional traits of Tregs in these individuals. Using transcriptomic analysis, we evaluated the proportion and functionality of different Treg subsets, specifically HLA_DR+ Tregs, across different stages of COVID-19 patients. Results Our analysis revealed that the proportion of CCR7 + Tregs decreased as the disease advanced, while the cell proportion of HLA_DR+ regs escalated with the severity of the disease. Moreover, the transcription actor CARHSP1 exhibited apositive correlation with the proportion of HLA_DR+ Tregs. Notably, the heightened suppressive function of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients, with interactions between PF4 and CXCR3, contributed to the homeostasis of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that Tregs in COVID-19 patients exhibited weakened TCR clonotype expansion, and the suppression of HLA_DR+ Tregs with expanded TCR clonotypes in severe COVID-19 cases did not show a significant increase compared to asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 groups. The findings indicate that Tregs may be activated through the bystander effect, as evidenced by the analysis of TCR clonotype characteristics. Discussion Our research delineates the diversity of dynamic alterations in Tregs and sheds light on potential mechanisms underlying Treg activation, providing a theoretical foundation and offering treatment strategies for managing COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT MAIT cells are one of the largest unconventional T cell populations and, recruited to the site of infection, play both protective and pathogenic roles during pulmonary viral infections. MAIT cell activation patterns change significantly during COVID‐19, with a notable decrease in their frequency in peripheral blood of severe cases. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiles of various immune checkpoint pathways on MAIT, MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells in moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients undergoing cytokine storm. Despite numerous studies comparing MAIT cell characteristics based on COVID‐19 disease severity, none have delved into the critical differences in MAIT cell immune checkpoint profiles between moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients, all experiencing a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry was used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 35 patients, comprising 18 moderate and 17 severe cases, alongside 14 healthy controls. Our investigation specifically focuses on severe COVID‐19 presentations, revealing a marked deletion of MAIT cells. Further exploration into the regulatory dynamics of MAIT cell functionality reveals shifts in the expression profiles of critical immune checkpoint receptors, notably PD‐1 and CD226. In severe COVID‐19 patients, MAIT cells showed a significant decrease in the expression of CD226, whereas MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of PD‐1 compared to healthy individuals. The expression of the TIGIT receptor remained unaltered across all investigated groups. Our findings contribute to the existing knowledge by elucidating the changes in MAIT cell subpopulations and their potential role in COVID‐19 disease severity.">

CD14+CD16+ monocytes exhibit diverse functions and contribute to neuroinflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-NCI). Analysis of human CD14+CD16+ monocytes matured in vitro by single-cell RNA sequencing identified a heterogenous population of nine clusters. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in each cluster identified increased migratory and inflammatory pathways for a group of clusters, which we termed Group 1 monocytes. Group 1 monocytes, distinguished by increased ALCAM, CD52, CD63, and SDC2, exhibited gene expression signatures implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases, produced higher levels of CXCL12, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and ROS, and preferentially transmigrated across a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model. Thus, Group 1 cells within the CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset are likely to be major contributors to neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Alcohol-induced dysregulation of microglial activity is associated with neuroinflammation, cognitive decline, heightened risk for neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol dependence, and escalation of alcohol drinking. Given the challenge of longitudinally sampling primary microglia, we optimized an in vitro method to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-human primates (NHP) into microglia-like cells (induced-microglia; iMGL). The iMGLs displayed transcriptional profiles distinct from those of monocyte progenitors and closely resembling those of primary microglia. Notably, morphological features showed that differentiated iMGLs derived from NHPs with chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) possessed a more mature-like microglial morphology. Additionally, dysregulation in key inflammatory and regulatory markers alongside increased baseline phagocytic activity was observed in CAC-derived IMGLs in the resting state. Phenotypic and functional assessments following LPS stimulation indicated the presence of an immune-tolerant phenotype and enrichment of a CD86+ hyper-inflammatory subpopulation in iMGLs derived from ethanol-exposed animals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vitro differentiation of PBMC offers a minimally invasive approach to studying the impact of CAC on microglial function revealing that CAC reshapes both functional and transcriptional profiles of microglia.">

Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1–/– mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1–/– animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng–/– mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1–/– animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

However, existing studies have mainly focused on peripheral blood samples and barely identified specific metabolites that are critically involved in the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current small-scale study, we performed metabolic profiling in plasma (n = 61) and paired bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples (n = 20) using parallel two-dimensional liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS). In addition, we studied how an identified metabolite regulates the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. The results unveiled distinct metabolome changes between healthy donors, and moderate and severe patients in both plasma and BALF, indicating that locations and disease severity play critical roles in COVID-19 metabolic alteration. Notably, a vital metabolite, indoxyl sulfate, was found to be elevated in both the plasma and BALF of severe COVID-19 patients. Indoxyl sulfate selectively induced TNF-α production, reduced co-stimulatory signals, and enhanced apoptosis in human monocytes. Moreover, its levels negatively correlated with the strength of co-stimulatory signals and antigen presentation capability in monocytes of COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that the levels of indoxyl sulfate could potentially serve as a functional biomarker to monitor COVID-19 disease progression and guide more individualized treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

Methods The study involved adult patients (≥18 years) who survived COVID-19, grouped into four cohorts: COVID-19 with sepsis (C19wSepsis), COVID-19 without sepsis (C19NoSepsis), sepsis alone, and healthy controls. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each cohort were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. PCD markers (caspase-3, caspase-1, MLKL, LC3B, p62/SQSTM1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma), and MHC molecules (MHC I-A, MHC II-DRB1) were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate differences in marker levels between and within cohorts. Results The analysis identified two distinct molecular signatures associated with disease severity. The first signature, characterized by elevated levels of secreted markers of PCD, IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma, MHC I-A and MHC II-DRB1, was common to the C19wSepsis and C19NoSepsis cohorts. The second signature, which was more prominent in the cellular markers of PCD (caspase-1, caspase-3, MLKL, p62/SQSTM1), was uniquely associated with the C19wSepsis cohort. Conclusion These findings provide insight into the molecular signatures distinguishing immune responses in COVID-19-related sepsis and may serve as valuable biomarkers for assessing disease severity, while guiding therapeutic interventions in critical care settings.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells remains very limited. The contributions of intracellular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also unclear. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for IGFBP2, specifically in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2), in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we show that IGFBP2 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in primary AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions from patients with COVID-19-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alone or IPF with a history of COVID-19. Using multicolor immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 and its selective ligands IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly reduced in AEC2 cells from patients with COVID-ARDS, IPF alone, or IPF with COVID history than in those from age-matched donor controls. Further, we demonstrated that lentiviral expression of Igfbp2 significantly reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines—Tnf-α, Il1β, Il6, Stat3, Stat6 and chemokine receptors—Ccr2 and Ccr5—in mouse lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injury (S2; 500 ng/mL). Finally, we demonstrated higher levels of cytokines—TNF-α; IL-6 and chemokine receptor—CCR5 in AEC2 cells from COVID-ARDS patients compared to the IPF alone and the IPF with COVID history patients. Altogether, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IGFBP2 in AEC2 cells and its localized delivery may serve as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with COVID-19.

        <tr id="Background HIV-1-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-1-NCI) is marked by ongoing and chronic neuroinflammation with loss and decline in neuronal function even when antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) successfully suppresses viral replication. Microglia, the primary reservoirs of HIV-1 in the central nervous system (CNS), play a significant role in maintaining this neuroinflammatory state. However, understanding how chronic neuroinflammation is generated and sustained by HIV-1, or impacted by ART, is difficult due to limited access to human CNS tissue. Methods We generated an in vitro model of admixed hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) derived microglia embedded into embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived Brain Organoids (BO). Microglia were infected with HIV-1 prior to co-culture. Infected microglia were co-cultured with brain organoids BOs to infiltrate the BOs and establish a model for HIV-1 infection, “HIV-1 M-BO”. HIV-1 M-BOs were treated with ART for variable directions. HIV-1 infection was monitored with p24 ELISA and by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Inflammation was measured by cytokine or p-NF-kB levels using multiplex ELISA, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results HIV-1 infected microglia could be co-cultured with BOs to create a model for “brain” HIV-1 infection. Although HIV-1 infected microglia were the initial source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, astrocytes, neurons and neural stem cells also had increased p-NF-kB levels, along with elevated CCL2 levels in the supernatant of HIV-1 M-BOs compared to Uninfected M-BOs. ART suppressed the virus to levels below the limit of detection but did not decrease neuroinflammation. Conclusions These findings indicate that HIV-1 infected microglia are pro-inflammatory. Although ART significantly suppressed HIV-1 levels, neuronal inflammation persisted in ART-treated HIV-1 M-BOs. Together, these findings indicate that HIV-1 infection of microglia infiltrated into BOs provides a robust in vitro model to understand the impact of HIV-1 and ART on neuroinflammation.

        <tr id="Background The role of immune cells in neurodegeneration remains incompletely understood. Accumulation of misfolded tau proteins is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Our recent study revealed the presence of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in the meninges, where they express antioxidant molecules to maintain meningeal barrier integrity. However, the role of MAIT cells in tau-related neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration remains unknown. Methods Flow cytometry analysis was performed to examine MAIT cells in human Tau P301S transgenic mice. Tau pathology, hippocampus atrophy, meningeal integrity, and microglial gene expression were examined in Mr1−/− P301S mice that lacked MAIT cells and control P301S transgenic mice, as well as Mr1−/− P301S mice with adoptive transfer of MAIT cells. Results The meninges of P301S mutant human tau transgenic mice had increased numbers of MAIT cells, which retained their expression of antioxidant molecules. Mr1−/−P301S mice that lacked MAIT cells exhibited increased tau pathology and hippocampus atrophy compared to control Mr1+/+P301S mice. Adoptive transfer of MAIT cells reduced tau pathology and hippocampus atrophy in Mr1−/− P301S mice. Meningeal barrier integrity was compromised in Mr1−/−P301S mice, but not in control Mr1+/+P301S mice. A distinctive microglia subset with a proinflammatory gene expression profile (M-inflammatory) was enriched in the hippocampus of Mr1−/−P301S mice. The transcriptomes of the remaining microglia in these mice also shifted towards a proinflammatory state, with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and genes related to ribosome biogenesis and immune responses to toxic substances. The transfer of MAIT cells restored meningeal barrier integrity and suppressed microglial inflammation in the Mr1−/− P301S mice. Conclusions Our data indicate an important role for MAIT cells in regulating tau-pathology-related neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which coexists as four genetically and immunologically distinct serotypes (DENV-1 to -4). In secondary heterologous DENV infection, pre-existing immunity is believed to contribute to severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Although the elevated pathology observed in ADE conditions has been described, the cell-intrinsic mechanisms governing this process remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages infected by DENV-2 in ADE compared to conventional infection conditions. Unsupervised analysis of scRNAseq data enabled the identification of two distinct cell populations in a heterogeneous cell culture, likely representing infected and bystander/uninfected cells. Differential gene expression and ingenuity pathway analyses revealed a number of significantly upregulated and downregulated genes and gene networks between cells infected by ADE compared to conventional infection. Specifically, these pathways indicated mechanisms such as suppressed interferon signaling and inflammatory chemokine transcription in cells infected via ADE. Further analysis revealed that transcriptomic changes were independent of viral RNA within infected cells, suggesting that the observed changes are reflective of cell-intrinsic responses and not simply a function of per-cell viral burden. The interpreted “bystander” cell population also demonstrated distinct profiles in ADE conditions, indicating an immunologically activated phenotype enriched for the expression of gene networks involved with protein translation, cytokine production, and antigen presentation. Together, these findings support the concept that DENV infection via ADE induces a qualitatively different transcriptomic response in infected cells, contributing to our understanding of ADE as a mechanistic driver of disease and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen with a significant and growing global health burden. Although correlates of severe dengue disease are poorly understood, pre-existing immunity to DENV has been associated with severe disease risk and known to contribute to an alternative route of viral entry termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct transcriptomic processes involved in antibody-mediated DENV entry compared to conventional receptor-mediated entry. These data provide meaningful insight into the discrete processes contributing to DENV pathogenesis in ADE conditions.">

        <tr id="Viral infections induce major shifts in cellular metabolism elicited by active viral replication and antiviral responses. For the virus, harnessing cellular metabolism and evading changes that limit replication are essential for productive viral replication. In contrast, the cellular response to infection disrupts metabolic pathways to prevent viral replication and promote an antiviral state in the host cell and neighboring bystander cells. This competition between the virus and cell results in measurable shifts in cellular metabolism that differ depending on the virus, cell type, and extracellular environment. The resulting metabolic shifts can be observed and analyzed using global metabolic profiling techniques to identify pathways that are critical for either viral replication or cellular defense. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus that can exhibit broad tissue tropism and diverse, yet inconsistent, symptomatology. While the factors that determine the presentation and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear, metabolic syndromes are associated with more severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Despite these observations a critical knowledge gap remains between cellular metabolic responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a well-established untargeted metabolomics analysis workflow, we compared SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung carcinoma cells. We identified significant changes in metabolic pathways that correlate with either productive or non-productive viral infection. This information is critical for characterizing the factors that contribute to SARS-CoV-2 replication that could be targeted for therapeutic interventions to limit viral disease.">

        <tr id="Background Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in immunocompromised individuals even in the presence of antiviral treatment provides opportunities for viruses to evolve in immune escape and drug-resistant variants. Case presentation A 72-year-old male with IgG4-related disease was admitted to the Emergency Department of a city Hospital in Milan and then transferred to Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in December 2023, due to respiratory distress due to SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed in November 2023. After 117 days since the onset of the infection, and two cycles of sotrovimab/remdesivir combined therapy, the clinical improvement allowed the hospital discharge, notwithstanding the persistent SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Fifteen days later, the patient was re-admitted to the hospital due to worsening clinical conditions. After a third cycle of sotrovimab/remdesivir combined therapy prolonged with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, nasopharyngeal load dropped and clinical conditions improved, ending with a successful discharge. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences, obtained at six time-points of infection, showed an FL.1.5.1 recombinant form infection and a genetic distance of median (IQR) 0.00052 (0.00041–0.00066) similar to the genetic distance observed among the 43 contemporaneous FL.1.5.1 recombinant forms (p = 0.098). De novo SNPs were observed at all time points, with a peak (n = 70) at day 133 of infection, corresponding to the time of the second hospitalization. Six non-synonymous mutations (three in the RdRp and three in the spike protein, four of them known to be associated with drug resistance) appeared transiently, after the third and fourth course of sotrovimab 500 mg/remdesivir combination. Five de novo SNPs, three of them in the spike protein, were fixed over the long-lasting infection. The spike N856K, associated with reduced fusogenicity and infectivity in Omicron BA.1, was completely replaced by constitutive N at day 136. Conclusions This clinical case confirms the intra-host evolution dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in an immunocompromised, prolonged-infected individual, involving positions associated with drug resistance and fusogenic traits of SARS-CoV-2. These results underscore the importance of the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised individuals, and its rapid containment using highly effective treatment, to limit serious complications and the risk of new and potentially concerning viral variants emergence.

        <tr id="Background: Two novel malaria vaccines, RTS,S and R21, mark a significant step forward in malaria research, but eradication demands vaccines with higher efficacy. Recent trials using late-arresting genetically attenuated parasites (LA-GAP) highlight their effectiveness as next-generation vaccines, likely through CD8+ T-cell activation targeting late liver-stage parasites. However, the distribution of LA-GAP-activated T cells in different organs that culminate towards high-level protection in the liver remains unclear. Methods: This study aimed to map immune responses in the livers and lungs of mice immunized with LA-GAP, shedding light on the role of different organs in priming T-cell responses towards immunity. Results: Particularly in the lungs we found an impressive increase of CD8+, double negative T cells (5%), γδ (2.5%), effector memory CD8+ T cells (46%), and tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (3%). These lung T cells are highly activated (expressing CD11c, Ki67, KLRG1) and exhibited 4-fold higher Granzyme A expression and significant TNF+ cell increases as compared to their liver counterparts (10.2% vs 2.6%). These differences start already at the early 2-day timepoint at which time the lungs show an impressive 10.2% increase in TNF+ CD8+ T cells, whereas the liver shows a more modest increase of 2.6% of these cells. Conclusion: These findings highlight the lungs as a crucial site for immune priming and T-cell activation, underscoring the need for further investigation of organ-specific responses to fully understand the potential of LA-GAP immunization as a powerful strategy in the fight against malaria.">

        <tr id="Adaptive immunity is generated in lymphoid organs, but how these structures defend themselves during infection in humans is unknown. The nasal epithelium is a major site of viral entry, with adenoid nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) generating early adaptive responses. In the present study, using a nasopharyngeal biopsy technique, we investigated longitudinal immune responses in NALT after a viral challenge, using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as a natural experimental model. In acute infection, infiltrating monocytes formed a subepithelial and perifollicular shield, recruiting neutrophil extracellular trap-forming neutrophils, whereas tissue macrophages expressed pro-repair molecules during convalescence to promote the restoration of tissue integrity. Germinal center B cells expressed antiviral transcripts that inversely correlated with fate-defining transcription factors. Among T cells, tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells alone showed clonal expansion and maintained cytotoxic transcriptional programs into convalescence. Together, our study provides unique insights into how human nasal adaptive immune responses are generated and sustained in the face of viral challenge.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID‐19 commonly leads to respiratory issues, yet numerous patients also exhibit a diverse range of neurological conditions, suggesting a detrimental impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 or the viral Spike protein on the central nervous system. Nonetheless, the molecular pathway behind neurological pathology and the presumed neurotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains largely unexplored. We generated human cortical organoids (HCOs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to assess: (1) the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 main entry factors; (2) their vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; and (3) the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to the Spike protein on their transcriptome. Results proved that (1) HCOs express the main SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors and co‐receptors; (2) HCOs may be productively infected by SARS‐CoV‐2; (3) the viral particles released by SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected HCOs are able to re‐infect another cellular line; and (4) the infection resulted in the activation of apoptotic and stress pathways, along with inflammatory processes. Notably, these effects were recapitulated when HCOs were exposed to the Spike protein alone. The data obtained demonstrate that SARS‐CoV‐2 likely infects HCOs probably through the binding of ACE2, CD147, and NRP1 entry factors. Furthermore, exposure to the Spike protein alone proved sufficient to disrupt their homeostasis and induce neurotoxic effects, potentially contributing to the onset of long‐COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="Introduction Hematogenous disseminated tuberculosis (DTB) has an unclear etiology that likely involves multiple factors. Understanding the underlying immunological characteristics of DTB is crucial for elucidating its pathogenesis. Methods We conducted single-cell RNA transcriptome and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on samples from seven DTB patients. Additionally, we integrated and analyzed data from two published profiles of latent TB infection, three active TB cases, and two healthy controls. Results Our analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of inflammatory immune cells (e.g., monocytes and macrophages) in DTB patients, along with a notably lower abundance of various lymphocytes (including T cells, B cells, and plasma cells), suggesting that lymphopenia is a prominent feature of the disease. T cell pseudotime analysis indicated a decrease in the expression of most hypervariable genes over time, pointing to T cell functional exhaustion. Furthermore, a marked absence of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells was observed in the peripheral blood of DTB patients. In the TCR repertoire, specific polymorphisms (TRAV9-2, TRAV13-1, TRBV20-1, and TRBV5-1) and dominant clones (TRAJ49, TRBJ2-7, and TRBJ2-1) were identified. Analysis of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) showed that the most frequent combination was TRAV1-2/TRAJ33, with the motif “CAAMD” being significantly reduced in DTB patients. Discussion These findings suggest that lymphopenia and T cell exhaustion, along with unique TCR signatures, may play critical roles in DTB pathogenesis. The reduced “CAAMD” motif and altered TCR clonotypes provide novel insights into the complex cellular dynamics associated with the disease, potentially offering new avenues for targeted immunological interventions.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Dendritic cells (DCs) in severe cases exhibited reduced proportions and attenuated expression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86), alongside increased cytochrome c expression, indicating impaired antigen presentation and enhanced apoptosis. NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease.">

        <tr id="A major challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been assessing the intensity, dynamics, and determinants of the antibody responses after infection and/or vaccination. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody responses among naturally infected individuals and individuals who achieved hybrid immunity in a large Canadian cohort. We demonstrate that anti-Spike IgGs and neutralizing antibody dynamics vary greatly among individuals with COVID-19, in peak antibody levels, rate of waning, and longevity of the antibody response. Additionally, we found an association between robust antibody responses and individuals with severe COVID-19 clinical symptoms during the first-month post-symptom onset. For individuals who achieved hybrid immunity, a robust increase in anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibodies followed the first vaccination dose; however, there was a minimal increase in the anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibody titers after administration of the second dose of the vaccine. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies elicited by the wild-type virus alone were largely ineffective against emerging variants of concern in our natural infection-only cohort, in contrast to a much broader and more robust neutralization profile observed in individuals who achieved hybrid immunity. Our findings emphasize the need for global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts to further sustain protective immune responses required to minimize viral spread and disease severity in the population. As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, understanding the interplay between previous infections, vaccine durability, and virus evolution will be critical for guiding ongoing vaccination strategies.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by demyelination and neuroinflammation, with oxidative stress playing a pivotal role in lesion pathology. This study aimed to investigate the differential cellular responses to myelin debris under varying oxidative states. Myelin oxidation was induced using a Cu–peroxide system, confirmed by elevated TBARS levels and autofluorescence. BV-2 microglia viability remained unaffected by myelin exposure. However, oxidized myelin significantly altered oxidative stress markers, autophagy, and iron metabolism, as evidenced by changes in Sod2, Tfr1, p62, and P-Erk/Erk ratios. Morphological analyses revealed time- and dose-dependent differences in myelin processing, with oxidized myelin leading to distinct phagosome dynamics. Complementary studies using induced microglia-like cells (iMG)—a primary cell culture—confirmed the feasibility of employing oxidized microglia to study microglia activity. The use of iMGs provides a model closer to patient physiology, offering the potential to evaluate individual cellular responses to oxidative damage. This approach could be instrumental in identifying personalized therapeutic strategies by assessing patient-specific microglial behavior in response to myelin debris. These findings highlight the impact of myelin oxidative status on microglial function, advancing the understanding of oxidative stress in MS and paving the way for personalized medicine applications in neuroinflammation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Type I interferons exert their antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including but not limited to LY6E, CH25H, IFITM2/3, and IFIH1. However, the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of action of most ISGs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet fully understood. By screening 109 ISG-knockout cell lines, we identify that phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an interferon-inducible protein, acts as a crucial restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells lacking PLSCR1 are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, overexpression of PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depletion of PLSCR1 enhances cellular entry of both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by specifically downregulating plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the virus’s receptor, without affecting the overall levels of ACE2 within the cell. As such, we unraveled previously unappreciated mechanisms by which PLSCR1 exerts its restrictive effect on SARS-CoV-2. These data provide new insights into the interplay between host innate antiviral immunity and SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on novel antiviral therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been identified as a critical host restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we demonstrated that PLSCR1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry by downregulating the plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for viral entry. Our findings elucidate a novel host-pathogen interaction that not only deepens our understanding of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 but offers potential strategies for therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background The T cell compartment undergoes significant age-related changes, contributing to the decline of the adaptive immune system and increasing the risk of suboptimal antibody responses to vaccines in older adults. To better understand the association between T cell phenotypes and vaccine responsiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of CD4+, CD8+, and γδ + T cells on VITAL cohort participants who are low or high responders to multiple vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and SARS-CoV-2). Results Using spectral cytometry and FlowSOM, we identified detailed phenotypes of naïve, regulatory, and terminally differentiated T cells. We observed that the percentages of CD31 + naïve CD4+, CD31 + naïve CD8+, and CD38 + naïve CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in low vaccine responders. Notably, CD31 + naïve T cell subsets showed a stronger correlation with immune entropy, a measure of cumulative immune system perturbations, than with age itself. Conclusions These findings suggest that subsets of naïve cells could be associated with weak vaccine responsiveness and immunosenescence. Furthermore, these naive T cell signatures could help predict weak vaccine responses, potentially informing targeted vaccination strategies in older adults.

        <tr id="The intestine hosts the largest immune system and peripheral nervous system in the human body. The gut‒brain axis orchestrates communication between the central and enteric nervous systems, playing a pivotal role in regulating overall body function and intestinal homeostasis. Here, using a human three-dimensional in vitro culture model, we investigated the effects of serotonin, a neuromodulator produced in the gut, on immune cell and intestinal tissue interactions. Serotonin attenuated the tumor necrosis factor-induced proinflammatory response, mostly by affecting the expression of chemokines. Serotonin affected the phenotype and distribution of tissue-migrating monocytes, without direct contact with the cells, by remodeling the intestinal tissue. Collectively, our results show that serotonin plays a crucial role in communication among gut–brain axis components and regulates monocyte migration and plasticity, thereby contributing to gut homeostasis and the progression of inflammation. In vivo studies focused on the role of neuromodulators in gut inflammation have shown controversial results, highlighting the importance of human experimental models. Moreover, our results emphasize the importance of human health research in human cell-based models and suggest that the serotonin signaling pathway is a new therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease.">

        <tr id="Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.">

        <tr id="Adult stem cell therapy holds great promise for treating decompensated liver cirrhosis on the basis of animal studies, despite uncertainty about its clinical therapeutic efficacy and unclear underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigated the role of follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), a profibrotic and proinflammatory matricellular protein, in inflammation-related heterogeneity in stem cell therapy. Our results showed that a high level of circulating FSTL1 is significantly correlated with therapeutic response in patients with cirrhosis. FSTL1 facilitated MSC-mediated early recruitment of Ly6C+ inflammatory macrophages within 24 h postinfusion, which was essential for the empowerment of MSCs and subsequent Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage remodelling at 48 h postinfusion. Fstl1 deficiency abrogated early macrophage recruitment and effective Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage accumulation, resulting in the poor antifibrotic effect of MSCs in mice. Whereas, recombinant FSTL1 protein restored the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in CCl4-injured Fstl1+/− mice. Mechanistically, host FSTL1 enhanced rapid recycling of CCR2 to the membrane via activation of the CD14/TLR4/NF-κB/ATP6V1G2 axis, leading to early recruitment of Ly6C+ monocytes /macrophages. Taken together, our findings revealed that FSTL1 is a critical regulator of the fibrotic immune microenvironment and facilitates subsequent stem cell therapy. These data suggest that FSTL1 could serve as a predictive biomarker of stem cell therapy response in patients with liver cirrhosis.">

        <tr id="Background Since the breakout of COVID-19, the mutated forms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have shown enhanced rates of transmission and adaptation to humans. The variants of concern (VOC), designated Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron emerged independent of one another, and in turn rapidly became dominant. The success of each VOC, as well as the virus fitness, were enabled by altered intrinsic functional properties and, reasonably, to virus antigenicity changes, conferring the ability to evade a primed immune response. Methods We analysed the gene expression profiles of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) isolated from whole blood of healthy participants exposed to the 5 different SARS-CoV-2 VOC: D614G, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron BA.1 (B.1.1.529), and to the HCoV-OC43 strain, a coronavirus already present in the population before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Whole transcriptome RNA-Seq, for both coding and non-coding RNAs, was then made. Results After exposure to the 5 VOC of MDM, we initially assessed the presence of the viral SARS-CoV-2 transcripts to confirm viral entry. We then analysed the RNA-Seq data and observed a significant deregulation of both coding and non-coding RNAs. In particular, our RNA-Seq analysis showed a significant up-regulation of several genes involved in different immunological processes, such as PARP9/PARP14 axes, in macrophages exposed to D614G, Alpha, and Gamma variants. Surprisingly, our data showed that macrophages exposed to the Delta variant exhibited a transcriptional profile more similar to the naïve control group, while macrophages exposed to the Omicron variant showed intermediate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups. By checking the canonical markers for M1/M2 differentiation states, we did not observe any expression in macrophages exposed to the Delta variant, suggesting an M0 status, comparable to the naïve control group. Finally, we observed a significant deregulation of 3 main types of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs): long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), some of which are common to coronaviruses, and some specific to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2-dependent alteration of the transcriptome of monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM)-infected cells can be linked to the chronological order of the variants’ appearance in the human population. Our data suggest an evolution of VOC in modulating the host immune response, with a strong change in pace beginning with the advent of the Delta variant. MDMs exposed to Delta showed a failure in the activation of the adaptive immune response, and this correlates with the more severe symptoms developed by people affected with this SARS-CoV-2 variant.

        <tr id="HIV infection exerts profound and long-lasting neurodegenerative effects on the central nervous system (CNS) that can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we used single-nucleus multiome sequencing to map the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of postmortem human brains from 13 healthy individuals and 20 individuals with HIV who have a history of treatment with ART. Our study spanned three distinct regions—the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and ventral striatum—enabling a comprehensive exploration of region-specific and cross-regional perturbations. We found widespread and persistent HIV-associated transcriptional and epigenetic alterations across multiple cell types. Detailed analyses of microglia revealed state changes marked by immune activation and metabolic dysregulation, while integrative multiomic profiling of astrocytes identified multiple subpopulations, including a reactive subpopulation unique to HIV-infected brains. These findings suggest that cells from people with HIV exhibit molecular shifts that may underlie ongoing neuroinflammation and CNS dysfunction. Furthermore, cell–cell communication analyses uncovered dysregulated and pro-inflammatory interactions among glial populations, underscoring the multifaceted and enduring impact of HIV on the brain milieu. Collectively, our comprehensive atlas of HIV-associated brain changes reveals distinct glial cell states with signatures of pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic dysregulation, providing a framework for developing targeted therapies for HIV-associated neurological dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are known to impact cellular and humoral immune response in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). In this study, we performed in-depth SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell profiling using flow cytometry. T-cell immunity in pwMS with or without DMTs was evaluated before a first SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccination and at one-, two- and six-month follow-up. T-cell stimulation without SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens was used as a control. T-cell response was compared to B-cell response by evaluating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We observed an upregulation of specific subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, our results demonstrate the induction of a broad and distinct CD4+ T-cell response in pwMS even on anti-CD20 treatment and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. This was particularly seen in CD4+high and CD4+CD154+ T cells. Our results do not support the induction of a CD8+ T-cell immune response. While humoral immune response was impaired in pwMS during ocrelizumab and fingolimod treatment, there was evidence of a compensatory upregulation of subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells at low levels of seroconversion in pwMS. In conclusion, our results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the adaptive immune response in pwMS following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.">

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to have neurotropism and therefore to lead to not only peripheral inflammatory responses but also neuroinflammation. Because the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), can be found in many intraocular tissues, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also contribute to persistent intraocular neuroinflammation, microcirculation dysfunction and ocular symptoms. Increased awareness of neuroinflammation and future research on interventional strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are important for improving long-term outcomes, reducing disease burden, and improving quality of life.

        <tr id="Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs’ functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, FCGRT gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of FCGRT showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, TRIM21 transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in TRIM21 transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors DDX58 and IFIH1, the transcriptional level of inflammatory IL1B and IL18 was generally very low, along with the NLRP3 danger sensor, members of the NF-κB pathway, and TNF. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.">

        <tr id="In this study, the critical role of the epipharynx in managing long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and in particular, how residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA affects signalling pathways in the epipharynx were investigated via spatial gene expression analysis (Visium HD). Moreover, we hypothesize that epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) targeting the epipharynx could improve long COVID symptoms by modulating local inflammation and gene expression. We conducted a comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles of three patients with long COVID and two control individuals without COVID-19. Residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the epipharynx of patients with long COVID, along with the activation of signalling pathways in epithelial and immune cells. After EAT, the viral RNA was either completely cleared or significantly reduced. T-cell receptor signalling pathways were suppressed; the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α, were reduced; and excessive antibody production was mitigated. Histology showed that EAT effectively eliminated the inflamed, dysfunctional ciliated epithelium. This study clarifies that SARS-CoV-2 has long-term effects on the immune response in the epipharynx, emphasizing the need to focus on chronic epipharyngitis as a potential cause of long COVID. Furthermore, EAT may offer a promising approach to alleviating persistent long COVID symptoms.">

The presence of host cells induces changes in bacterial activity, while pathogens trigger immune responses that shape the microenvironment. Studying infection dynamics by microscopy, cytokine screening, and dual RNA sequencing in an air–liquid interface model, we found that prolonged Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization of airway epithelium led to a pro-inflammatory response, consistent across P. aeruginosa strains, despite differences in the dynamics of this response. Concurrently, P. aeruginosa formed non-attached aggregates on the apical side of the cell layer and upregulated genes involved in biofilm formation and virulence. Notably, there was remarkable resemblance between the P. aeruginosa transcriptional profile in our model and that previously reported upon host cell contact. Developing a platform that replicates host microenvironments is vital not only for gaining deeper insights into the interplay between host and pathogen but also for evaluating therapeutic strategies in conditions that closely mirror clinical environments.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection widely induces antibody response targeting diverse viral proteins, including typical representative N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), and S2 subunit of spike. A lot of NTD-, RBD-, and S2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been isolated from COVID-19 convalescents, some of which displaying potent activities to inhibit viral infection. However, a small portion of NTD-specific mAbs elicited by wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 primary infection could facilitate the virus entry into target cells in vitro, so called NTD-targeting infection-enhancing antibodies (NIEAs). To date, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to massive variants carrying various NTD mutations, especially recent Omicron BA.2.86 and JN.1. In this study, we investigated whether these WT-NIEAs could still enhance the infectivity of emerging Omicron variants. Nine novel WT-NIEAs with diverse germline gene usage were identified from 3 individuals, effectively enlarging available antibody panel of NIEAs. Bivalent binding of NIEAs to inter-spike contributed to their infection-enhancing activities. WT-NIEAs could enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged before Omicron, but ineffective to Omicron variants including BA.2.86 and JN.1, which was because of their changed antigenicity of NTDs. Overall, these data clearly demonstrated the cross-reactivity of these pre-existed WT-NIEAs to a series of SARS-CoV-2 variants, helping to evaluate the risk of enhanced infection of emerging variants in future.

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="Background Since the emergence of COVID-19 at the end of 2019, the disease has led to widespread acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), who are at increased risk due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy. This study aims to explore the differences in immune responses between kidney transplant recipients and non-kidney transplant recipients in COVID-19-induced ARDS to identify potential therapeutic targets for improving outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 108,320 cells derived from peripheral blood samples to construct a global single-cell map of COVID-19 induced ARDS in kidney transplant recipients(ARDSKT), COVID-19 induced ARDS in non transplant recipients(ARDSNKT), and healthy controls. Subsequently, using cellular clustering analysis, we obtained single-cell maps of different cell types. We employed enrichment analysis to determine the pathways involved in different subpopulations and focused on the role of key immune cells such as monocytes, megakaryocytes, B cells, and CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Significant immune differences were observed between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT. In ARDSKT, the S100A9+ MK subpopulation, which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, was elevated, promoting inflammation. In contrast, the S100A12+ monocyte subpopulation that activates the chemokine signaling pathway was more abundant in ARDSNKT, reflecting a stronger inflammatory response, while its abundance was reduced in ARDSKT due to immunosuppression. The CXCR4+ B subpopulation, crucial for adaptive immunity, was significantly reduced in ARDSKT. Additionally, the XAF1+ Teff subpopulation, associated with apoptosis, was more abundant in ARDSKT, potentially impairing immune recovery. This study highlights the immune differences between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT, revealing the impact of immunosuppression on immune dysregulation. These findings suggest that targeting specific immune pathways can improve therapeutic strategies for ARDSKT.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID‐19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS‐CoV‐2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID‐19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high‐throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID‐19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID‐19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Lung manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are often exacerbated by influenza A virus infections; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown and hence, therapeutic options are limited. Using a physiologically relevant human lung airway-on-a-chip (Airway Chip) microfluidic culture model lined with human airway epithelium from COPD or healthy donors interfaced with pulmonary microvascular endothelium, we observed that Airway Chips lined with COPD epithelium exhibit an increased sensitivity to influenza virus infection, as is observed clinically in COPD patients. Differentiated COPD airway epithelial cells display increased inflammatory cytokine production, barrier function loss, and mucus accumulation upon virus infection. Transcriptomic analysis revealed gene expression profiles characterized by upregulation of serine proteases that may facilitate viral entry and downregulation of interferon-related genes associated with antiviral immune responses. Importantly, treatment of influenza virus-infected COPD epithelium with a protease inhibitor, nafamostat, ameliorated the disease phenotype as evidenced by dampened viral replication, reduced mucus accumulation, and improved tissue barrier integrity. These findings suggest that targeting host serine proteases may represent a promising therapeutic avenue against influenza-afflicted COPD exacerbations.">

        <tr id="In human lupus nephritis (LuN), tubulointerstitial inflammation (TII) is prognostically more important than glomerular inflammation. However, a comprehensive understanding of both TII complexity and heterogeneity is lacking. Herein, we used high-dimensional confocal microscopy and specialized computer vision techniques to quantify immune cell populations and localize these within normal and diseased renal cortex structures. With these tools, we compared LuN to renal allograft rejection (RAR) and normal kidney. In both LuN and RAR, the 33 characterized immune cell populations formed discrete subgroups whose constituents co-varied in prevalence across biopsies. In both diseases, these co-variant immune cell subgroups organized into the same unique niches. Therefore, inflammation could be resolved into trajectories representing the relative prevalence and density of cardinal immune cell members of each co-variant subgroup. Indeed, in any one biopsy, the inflammatory state could be characterized by quantifying constituent immune cell trajectories. Remarkably, LuN heterogeneity could be captured by quantifying a few myeloid immune cell trajectories while RAR was more complex with additional T cell trajectories. Our studies identify rules governing renal inflammation and thus provide an approach for resolving LuN into discrete mechanistic categories. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Microglia and astrocytes are the primary glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and their function is shaped by multiple factors. Regulation of CNS glia by the microbiota have been reported, although the role of specific bacteria has not been identified. We colonized germ-free mice with the type strain Akkermansia muciniphila (AmT) and a novel A. muciniphila strain BWH-H3 (Am-H3) isolated from a subject with multiple sclerosis and compared to mice colonized with Bacteroides cellulosilyticus strain BWH-E5 (Bc) isolated from a healthy control subject. We then investigated the effect of these bacteria on microglia and astrocyte gene expression by RNA sequencing. We found altered gene expression profiles in brain microglia, with Akkermansia downregulating genes related to antigen presentation and cell migration. Furthermore, we observed strain specific effects, with Akkermansia H3 upregulating histone and protein binding associated genes and downregulating channel and ion transport genes. Astrocyte pathways that were altered by Akkermansia H3 mono-colonization included upregulation of proliferation pathways and downregulation in cytoskeletal associated genes. Furthermore, animals colonized with type strain Akkermansia and strain H3 had effects on the immune system including elevated splenic γδ-T cells and increased IFNγ production in CD4 + T cells. We also measured intestinal short chain fatty acids and found that both A. muciniphila strains produced proprionate while B. cellulosilyticus produced acetate, proprionate, and isovalerate. Taken together, our study shows that specific members of the intestinal microbiota influence both microglial and astroyctes which may be mediated by changes in short chain fatty acids and peripheral immune signaling.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes pulmonary edema, which disrupts the lung alveoli–capillary barrier and leads to pulmonary cell apoptosis, the main cause of death. However, the molecular mechanism behind SARS-CoV-2’s apoptotic activity remains unknown. Here, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a mediates the pulmonary pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is demonstrated by the fact that it causes lung tissue damage. The in vitro results showed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a triggers cell death via the disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis, which is modulated through the regulation of Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive Potassium Channel (MitoKATP). The addition of exogenous Potassium (K+) in the form of potassium chloride (KCl) attenuated mitochondrial apoptosis along with the inflammatory interferon response (IFN-β) triggered by SARS-ORF-3a. The addition of exogenous K+ strongly suggests that dysregulation of K+ ion channel function is the central mechanism underlying the mitochondrial dysfunction and stress response induced by SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a. Our results designate that targeting the potassium channel or its interactions with ORF-3a may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate the damaging effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Molecular changes underlying the persistent health effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. To discern the gene regulatory landscape in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients, we performed enzymatic DNA methylome and single-cell RNA sequencing in nasal cells of COVID-19 patients (n = 19, scRNA-seq n = 14) and controls (n = 14, scRNA-seq n = 10). In addition, we resampled a subset of these patients for transcriptome analyses at 3 (n = 7) and 12 months (n = 5) post infection and followed the expression of differentially regulated genes over time. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed 3112 differentially methylated regions between COVID-19 patients and controls. Hypomethylated regions affected immune regulatory genes, while hypermethylated regions were associated with genes governing ciliary function. These genes were not only downregulated in the acute phase of the disease but sustained repressed up to 12 months post infection in ciliated cells. Validation in an independent cohort collected 6 months post infection (n  = 15) indicated symptom-dependent transcriptional repression of ciliary genes. We therefore propose that hypermethylation observed in the acute phase may exert a long-term effect on gene expression, possibly contributing to post-acute COVID-19 sequelae.">

        <tr id="Background COVID-19 appears to have a progression of three stages. The latter stage is characterized by a high level of cytokine release, which in turn triggers an uncontrolled reaction known as cytokine storm where mast cells are involved. The presence of anti-IgE antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in this phase has been previously reported, suggesting an association with the severity of the disease. Our study aims to assess the prognostic significance of IgE antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 across a spectrum of clinical presentations, including individual with mild symptoms, hospitalized patients, and those who presented a critical progression. Methods The study included 64 patients distributed into the following groups: 22 critically ill hospitalized individuals (Critical); 21 non-critical hospitalized patients (Severe); 21 mild symptomatic non-hospitalized cases (Mild); and 22 healthy blood donors with samples collected in October 2019. Anti-IgE antibodies against Spike (S) protein were detected using a homemade ELISA, where the plate was sensitized with the RBD of recombinant S protein. Results Among 64 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 28.1% tested positive for IgE isotype antibodies against S protein RBD, whose prevalence was similar across severity groups: Mild 23.8%, Severe 28.6%, and Critical 31.8% (p = 0.842). Patients with IgE response exhibited higher levels of LDH compared to non-IgE responders, with a 40% increase (p = 0.037), and a non-significantly higher tendency in other inflammatory markers. Conclusion In SARS-CoV-2 infection, roughly a fourth of patients presented an IgE isotype response, regardless of disease severity, which is associated with higher levels of LDH.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT In a subset of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals treated with the antiviral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the virus rebounds following treatment. The mechanisms driving this rebound are not well understood. We used a mathematical model to describe the longitudinal viral load dynamics of 51 individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, 20 of whom rebounded. Target cell preservation, either by a robust innate immune response or initiation of N-R near the time of symptom onset, coupled with incomplete viral clearance, appears to be the main factor leading to viral rebound. Moreover, the occurrence of viral rebound is likely influenced by the time of treatment initiation relative to the progression of the infection, with earlier treatments leading to a higher chance of rebound. A comparison with an untreated cohort suggests that early treatments with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be associated with a delay in the onset of an adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, our model demonstrates that extending the course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment to a 10-day regimen may greatly diminish the chance of rebound in people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. Altogether, our results suggest that in some individuals, a standard 5-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir starting around the time of symptom onset may not completely eliminate the virus. Thus, after treatment ends, the virus can rebound if an effective adaptive immune response has not fully developed. These findings on the role of target cell preservation and incomplete viral clearance also offer a possible explanation for viral rebounds following other antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. In a subset of individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the initial reduction in viral load is followed by viral rebound once treatment is stopped. We show that the timing of treatment initiation with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may influence the risk of viral rebound. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir stops viral growth and preserves target cells but may not lead to full clearance of the virus. Thus, once treatment ends, if an effective adaptive immune response has not adequately developed, the remaining virus can lead to rebound. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of rebound and can help develop better treatment strategies to minimize this possibility.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly enhanced our understanding of CD8+ T cell immunity and their role in natural infection and vaccine-induced protection. Rapid and early SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses have been associated with efficient viral clearance and mild disease. Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses can compensate for waning, morbidity-related, and iatrogenic reduction of humoral immunity. After infection or vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells are formed, which mount an efficient recall response in the event of breakthrough infection and help to protect from severe disease. Due to their breadth and ability to target mainly highly conserved epitopes, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are also able to cross-recognize epitopes of viral variants, thus maintaining immunity even after the emergence of viral evolution. In some cases, however, CD8+ T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. In particular, delayed and uncontrolled, e.g., nonspecific and hyperactivated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses have been linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes. In this minireview, we summarize the tremendous knowledge about CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination that has been gained over the past 5 years, while also highlighting the critical knowledge gaps that remain.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity provides the critical first line of defense against infection and sterile triggers. Cell death is a key component of the innate immune response to clear pathogens, but excessive or aberrant cell death can induce inflammation, cytokine storm, and pathology, making it a central molecular mechanism in inflammatory diseases. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one such inflammatory disease, but the specific innate immune mechanisms driving pathology in this context remain unclear. Here, by leveraging RNAseq and tissue expression in clinical samples, we identified increased expression of the innate immune sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) in patients with ALD. We discovered that ZBP1 expression correlated with ALD progression in patients, and that ethanol induced ZBP1-dependent lytic cell death, PANoptosis, in immune (macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells) and non-immune cells (hepatocytes). Mechanistically, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF9 and IRF1 upregulated ZBP1 expression, allowing ZBP1 to sense Z-NAs through its Zα2 domain and drive PANoptosis signaling, cell membrane rupture through NINJ1, and DAMP release. Furthermore, the expressions of ZBP1 and NINJ1 were upregulated in both liver and serum samples from patients with ALD. In mouse models of chronic and acute ALD, ZBP1-deficient mice were significantly protected from disease pathology and liver damage. Overall, our findings establish the critical role of the ZBP1-NINJ1 axis regulated by IRFs in driving inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in liver cells, suggesting that targeting these molecules will have therapeutic potential in ALD and other inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by immune dysregulation that facilitates chronic infection. Objective: To investigate the role of T cells in the immunopathology of CL by characterizing the immune landscape of skin lesions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods: We performed scRNA-seq to profile T cells from PBMC and skin lesions of CL patients. Results: We analyzed the transcriptional profile of distinct populations of CD4+ and CD8+ migratory T cells in CL lesions. CD8+ resident T cells displayed expression of exhaustion markers and were categorized into progenitor, transitional, and terminal stages, with HAVCR2 (TIM-3) identified as a potential driver of dysfunction. Compared to psoriasis and healthy skin, CL lesions showed a reduced frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially linked to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased apoptosis. We also detected double-negative (DN) gd T cells, suggesting their potential role in antigen presentation via MHC class II through TGF-b signaling. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into immune evasion mechanisms in CL, identifying TIM-3, Treg modulation, and the functional role of DN gd T cells as distinct potential targets for future immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) ligands effectively reduce immunopathological damage in viral pneumonia models. Specifically, S1P1 ligands inhibit cytokine storm and help preserve lung endothelial barrier integrity. We recently showed that the S1P receptor ligand ozanimod can be safely administered to hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibiting severe symptoms of viral pneumonia, with potential clinical benefits. Here, we extend on this study and investigate the impact of ozanimod on key features of the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. We quantified circulating cytokine levels, peripheral immune cell numbers, proportions and activation status; we also monitored the quality of the humoral response by assessing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) antibodies. Our findings reveal that patients receiving ozanimod during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significantly reduced numbers of circulating monocytes compared with those receiving standard care. Correspondingly, in the ozanimod-treated group, circulating levels of C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) were decreased. While treatment with ozanimod negatively impacted the humoral response to COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, it did not impair the development of a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in vaccinated patients. These findings suggest that ozanimod influences key immune mechanisms during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can provide information on patient immunity, identify asymptomatic patients, and track the spread of COVID-19. Efforts have been made to develop methods to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Here, we describe a flow cytometric assay for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in human plasma. To assess the antibody response against the different SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, five viral recombinant proteins, including spike protein subunit 1 (S1), N-terminal domain of S1 (S1A), spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein subunit 2 (S2), and nucleocapsid protein (N), were generated. A comparison of the antibody profiles detected by the assay with plasma from 100 healthy blood donors collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and plasma from 100 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated a clear discrimination between the two groups. Among the COVID-19 patients, the antibody responses for the viral proteins, as determined by their prevalence, were anti-RBD IgG = anti-N IgG > anti-S1 IgG > anti-S1A IgG > anti-S2 IgG, and anti-RBD IgM > anti-S1 IgM > anti-N IgM > anti-S2 IgM. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM was not associated with sex, age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness, except for a higher prevalence of anti-S2 IgG being observed in men than in women. The levels of anti-RBD IgG were higher in patients 65 years and older and in patients who had severe symptoms. Similarly, patients who had severe symptoms exhibited higher levels of anti-S1 and anti-S1A IgG than patients who had mild or moderate symptoms. The levels of anti-RBD IgM tended to be higher in men but did not differ among age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness. Our study indicates that the flow cytometric assay, especially using RBD as target antigen, can be used to detect simultaneously anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in human plasma.">

        <tr id="T-cell-mediated immunity is essential for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) infection, preventing severe disease, and potentially reducing the risk of long-term coronavirus disease (COVID). This study investigated the impact of natural infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity on T-cell responses, with a particular emphasis on the role of memory T-cells in long-term COVID-19. The present study reviewed current literature on T-cell responses, including memory T-cell development, in individuals with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, those vaccinated with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, and those with hybrid immunity. It examined studies that compared T-cell activity, immune regulation, and the prevalence of long-term COVID-19 across these groups. Natural infection induces variable T-cell responses, with severe cases showing stronger but sometimes dysregulated immunological activity, which may contribute to prolonged COVID-19. Vaccination, particularly with mRNA vaccines, elicits targeted and consistent T-cell responses, including memory T-cells, reducing disease severity, and the incidence of long-term COVID-19. Hybrid immunity combines natural infection and vaccination, provides the most robust protection, enhanceds memory T-cell responses, and reduces the risk of long-term COVID-19 through balanced immune regulation. Memory T-cells play a critical role in mitigating long-term COVID-19. Vaccination significantly enhances T-cell-mediated immunity, minimizing the risk of chronic symptoms compared to natural infection alone. Hybrid immunity provides the most effective defense, emphasizing the importance of vaccination, even after natural infection, to prevent long-term COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on all aspects of human activity worldwide, frequently resulting in post-acute sequelae and affecting multiple organ systems. The underlying mechanisms driving both acute and post-acute manifestations of COVID-19 are still poorly understood, warranting further investigation for new targets. The study represents the first attempt to explore the role of T-cadherin in COVID-19 pathogenesis as well as its implications in pulmonary fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. First, we revealed a significant decrease in T-cadherin expression in post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19 patients. This downregulated T-cadherin expression correlated with the elevated levels of VE-cadherin and reduced levels of β-catenin, suggesting a disruption in endothelial cell-cell contact integrity and function. Second, the reciprocal relation of T-cadherin and VE-cadherin expression was further confirmed using cultured human endothelial Ea.hy926 cells. T-cadherin overexpression caused a decrease in VE-cadherin mRNA expression in cultured endothelial cells providing additional evidence in favor of their interplay. Third, employing Cdh13 −/− mice, we unveiled the protective role of T-cadherin deficiency against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Fourth, we demonstrated the mice lacking T-cadherin to have downregulated reactive oxygen species production and Nox2 mRNA expression in an angiotensin II-mediated endothelial dysfunction model. Our findings provide rationale for further studies into T-cadherin-mediated mechanisms in these processes.">

        <tr id="The nature of the effector and memory T cell response in the lungs following acute SARS-CoV-2 infections remains largely unknown. To define the pulmonary T-cell response to COVID-19, we compared effector and memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in mice. Both viruses elicited potent effector T cell responses in lungs, but memory T cells showed exaggerated contraction in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, unlike the T-bet/EOMES-driven effector transcription program in IAV lungs, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells embarked on a STAT-3-centric transcriptional program, a defining characteristic of a pro-fibro-inflammatory program: limited cytotoxicity, diminished expression of tissue-protective inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT), and augmented mucosal imprinting (CD103). Circulating CD45RO+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients expressed elevated levels of STAT-3 and low levels of TIGIT. IL-6 blockade experiments implicated IL-6 in STAT-3 induction and downregulation of PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific primary effector CD8 T cells. Memory CD8 T cells specific to a single epitope, induced by mucosal vaccination, differentiated into cytotoxic effectors and expressed high levels of CD103, effectively reducing viral burden in lungs following a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings have implications for developing targeted immunotherapies to mitigate immunopathology and promote protective T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background COVID‐19 exhibits a variety of symptoms and may lead to multi‐organ failure and death. This clinical complexity is exacerbated by significant immune dysregulation affecting nearly all cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. Granulocytes, including eosinophils, are affected by SARS‐CoV‐2. Objectives Eosinophil responses remain poorly understood despite early recognition of eosinopenia as a hallmark feature of COVID‐19 severity. Results The heterogeneous nature of eosinophil responses categorizes them as dual‐function cells with contradictory effects. Eosinophil activation can suppress virus‐induced inflammation by releasing type 2 cytokines like IL‐13 and granular proteins with antiviral action such as eosinophil‐derived neurotoxins and eosinophil cationic protein, and also by acting as antigen‐presenting cells. In contrast, eosinophil accumulation in the lungs can induce tissue damage triggered by cytokines or hormones like IFN‐γ and leptin. Additionally, they can affect adaptive immune functions by interacting with T cells through direct formation of membrane complexes or soluble mediator action. Individuals with allergic disorders who have elevated levels of eosinophils in tissues and blood, such as asthma, do not appear to be at an increased risk of developing severe COVID‐19 following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. However, the SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine appears to be associated with complications and eosinophilic infiltrate‐induced immunopathogenicity, which can be mitigated by corticosteroid, anti‐histamines and anti‐IL‐5 therapy and avoided by modifying adjuvants or excipients. Conclusion This review highlights the importance of eosinophils in COVID‐19 and contributes to a better understanding of their role during natural infection and vaccination.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lung diseases are widespread worldwide. Pulmonary immunity plays a vital role against lung pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the pathogenesis, including the development of local immune responses to infection, is fundamental for developing interventions to control the viral infection. Methods Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and euthanized 11–14 days later. Results Tertiary lymphoid tissue was found in all SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. The number (13.9 vs 1.5 iPLT number/ lung cm2), size (25992 vs 13946 µm2) and total area (0.46 vs 0.02 mm2 iPLT/ lung cm2) of the lymphoid tissue aggregations were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals than that of normal controls. This induced pulmonary lymphoid tissues comprised B cells, T cells, CD169 macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells with evidence of lymphocyte priming and differentiation. Discussion The results suggest local immunity plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study of pulmonary immunity could lead to new interventions to develop vaccine strategies and discover new immune-regulatory biomarkers in monitoring and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and other lung diseases.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged the current understanding of the complement cascade mechanisms of host immune responses during infection-induced nonresolvable lung disease. While the complement system is involved in opsonization and phagocytosis of the invading pathogens, uncontrolled complement activation also leads to aberrant autophagic response and tissue damage. Our recent study revealed unique pathologic and fibrotic signature genes associated with epithelial bronchiolization in the lung tissues of patients with nonresolvable COVID-19 (NR-COVID-19) requiring lung transplantation. However, there is a knowledge gap if complement components are modulated to contribute to tissue damage and the fibrotic phenotype during NR-COVID-19. We, therefore, aimed to study the role of the complement factors and their corresponding regulatory proteins in the pathogenesis of NR-COVID-19. We further examined the association of complement components with mediators of the host autophagic response. We observed significant upregulation of the expression of the classical pathway factor C1qrs and alternative complement factors C3 and C5a, as well as the anaphylatoxin receptor C5aR1, in NR-COVID-19 lung tissues. Of note, complement regulatory protein, decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) was significantly downregulated at both transcript and protein levels in the NR-COVID-19 lungs, indicating a dampened host protective response. Furthermore, we observed significantly decreased levels of the autophagy mediators PPARγ and LC3a/b, which was corroborated by decreased expression of factor P and the C3b receptor CR1, indicating impaired clearance of damaged cells that may contribute to the fibrotic phenotype in NR-COVID-19 patients. Thus, our study revealed previously unrecognized complement dysregulation associated with impaired cell death and clearance of damaged cells, which may promote NR-COVID-19 in patients, ultimately necessitating lung transplantation. The identified network of dysregulated complement cascade activity indicates the interplay of regulatory factors and the receptor-mediated modulation of host immune and autophagic responses as potential therapeutic targets for treating NR-COVID-19.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoinflammatory disease of unknown origin, involving characterized by immune cell infiltration into the target tissue, central nervous system (CNS), resulting in local and/or systemic inflammation. The symptoms vary from gait disturbance, visual impairment and learning and memory impairment and are being managed with corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive agents. However, several patients do not respond to these treatments, which can also elevate the risk of severe infections. Therefore, there remains an ongoing need to identify new therapeutic targets. MS exhibits distinctive pathology, clinical course, and treatment responses, suggesting the importance of targeting disease site-specific immune cells to mitigate immune system-induced inflammation, rather than employing broad immunosuppression. Chemokines and chemokine receptors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MS by recruiting immune cells to the CNS, leading to inflammation and demyelination. Therapies targeting chemokines have shown promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials, but more research is needed to fully understand their mechanisms and optimize their efficacy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential players in the immune response to infections, involved in shaping innate and adaptive immunity. However, a complete understanding of their specific roles in respiratory infections, including SARS‐CoV‐2, remains elusive. Methods To investigate the dynamics of monocytes and DCs in blood as well as the upper and lower airways, we sampled 147 patients with varying degree of COVID‐19 severity longitudinally during the spring of 2020. Results Using flow cytometry, proteomics and in vitro TLR stimulation, we found differences in the distribution and function of monocytes and DCs in patients compared with controls, and importantly, reduced levels of DCs in both blood and airways. In fact, lower frequencies of cDC2s (Lin− HLA‐DR+ CD1c+) early after symptom onset predicted subsequent severe disease, and depletion of DC subsets lasted longer in patients with more severe disease. In contrast, severe COVID‐19 was associated with increased frequencies of activated monocytes in the lower, but not the upper, airways. Proteomic analysis showed that monocyte and DC‐related cytokines in plasma and airways associated with disease severity. During convalescence, cell frequencies and responses to TLR ligands normalised in blood, except for persistently low plasmacytoid DCs. Conclusion Our study reveals a distinct pattern of recruitment of monocytes but not DCs to the airways during severe COVID‐19. Instead, decreased levels of DCs in both blood and airways were found, possibly contributing to more severe COVID‐19. The connection between low blood DCs early in disease course and more severe outcomes provides insight into COVID‐19 immunopathology, with possible therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide range of treatment options have been evaluated in preclinical studies and clinical trials, with several being approved for use in humans. Immunomodulatory drugs have shown success in dampening the deleterious inflammatory response seen in severe COVID-19 patients, but there remains an urgent need for development of additional therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. A potential drug target is the CCR5-CCL5 axis, and blocking this pathway may protect against severe disease. Here we evaluated whether OB-002, an analog of human CCL5 and a potent antagonist of CCR5, provides therapeutic benefit in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. Daily treatment with OB-002 altered immune gene transcription in the lungs, and reduced pathology following infection, but did not prevent weight loss or viral replication in the lungs of infected animals, even in combination with the antiviral drug remdesivir. Our data suggest that targeting the CCR5-CCL5 pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters is insufficient to significantly impact disease development in this model.">

        <tr id="Background The intricacies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing acute lung injury (ALI) and modulating inflammatory factor dynamics in vivo remain poorly elucidated. The present study endeavors to explore the impact of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (S1SP) on ALI and inflammatory factor profiles in mice, aiming to uncover potential therapeutic targets and intervention strategies for the prevention and management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods To mimic COVID-19 infection, K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were intratracheally instilled with S1SP, while C57BL/6 mice were administered LPS to form a positive control group. This setup facilitated the examination of lung injury severity, inflammatory factor levels, and alterations in signaling pathways in mice mimicking COVID-19 infection. Histopathological assessment through HE staining, along with analysis of lung wet/dry ratio and ultrasound imaging, revealed severe lung injury. Results After molding, K18-hACE2 mice exhibited a pronounced reduction in body weight and showed more significant lung injury (P < 0.05). Notably, there was a significant elevation in vascular permeability, total protein, and total white blood cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (P < 0.05), indicative of tissue damage. Additionally, the tight junction of lung tissue was compromised (P < 0.05), accompanied by intense oxidative stress marked by decreased SOD activity and elevated MDA content (P < 0.05). Cytokine levels, including IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MIG, were significantly upregulated in both BALF and serum of S1SP + K18 mice (P < 0.05). Furthermore, S1SP prominently augmented the expression of p-p65/P65 and attenuated IκBα expression in the NF-κB signaling pathway of humanized mice (P < 0.05), corroborating a heightened inflammatory response at the tissue level (P < 0.05). Conclusion The administration of S1SP to K18-hACE2 mice resulted in severe lung injury, enhanced vascular permeability, and compromised epithelial barrier function in vivo. This was accompanied by disruption of lung tight junctions, the manifestation of severe oxidative stress and a cytokine storm, as well as the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, highlighting key pathological processes underlying COVID-19-induced lung injury.

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has presented multifaceted health challenges. COVID-19 primarily targets the respiratory system but also affects multiple organ systems, including the endocrine system. Emerging evidence suggests interactions between thyroid function, the acute phase of COVID-19, and the prolonged symptoms known as post-COVID sequalae or long COVID. Several studies have reported that COVID-19 can induce thyroid dysfunction, leading to conditions such as thyroiditis and alterations in thyroid hormone levels. The mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 affects the thyroid include direct viral infection of thyroid cells, leading to viral thyroiditis, which causes inflammation and transient or sustained thyroid dysfunction, as well as an excessive systemic immune response (cytokine storm). This is associated with elevated levels of cytokines, such as IL-6, that disrupt thyroid function and lead to nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). Medications administered during the acute illness phase, such as corticosteroids and antiviral drugs, can also impact thyroid hormone actions. The involvement of the thyroid gland in long COVID, or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, is an area not well defined, with potential implications for understanding and managing this condition. Persistent low-grade inflammation affecting thyroid function over time can lead to ongoing thyroiditis or exacerbate pre-existing thyroid conditions. Viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, can trigger or worsen autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’ disease. Long COVID may disrupt the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, which can, in turn, affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, leading to abnormal thyroid function. This review was designed to systematically capture recent literature on COVID-19-related thyroid dysfunction in the adult population, the prognostic consequences of thyroid dysfunction during COVID-19, and the effects of thyroid dysfunction on patients with long COVID. A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE databases was conducted. The systematic review was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). A total of 53 studies met the inclusion criteria. The review summarises recent findings and provides an update of the current understanding of thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19-related spectrum of disorders, underscoring the complex nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its far-reaching impacts on human health.">

        <tr id="Objectives/Goals: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to impact multiple organ systems, including the brain, and is associated with increased cognitive decline in vulnerable populations. The gut microbiome may play a significant role in modulating these effects, as shifts in microbiota composition have been linked to inflammation and systemic disease processes. Methods/Study Population: To explore these interactions, we conducted an acute COVID-19 study using 12-week-old C57 mice intranasally inoculated with 1x10^4 PFU of the Mouse Adapted 10 (MA-10) strain of SARS-CoV-2. On day 5 postinfection, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing on fecal samples, analyzed using QIIME2 and DeSeq2, to assess microbiome alterations and identify changes in metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory responses. Results/Anticipated Results: Analysis revealed notable shifts in the gut microbiome during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, with significant alterations in metabolic pathways related to inflammation and immune regulation. These changes suggest that early gut microbiome disruptions may contribute to the host response in acute COVID-19. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Our findings indicate that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to rapid alterations in the gut microbiome, which could underlie inflammatory and immune pathways impacting disease progression. These insights highlight the potential for microbiome-targeted therapies to mitigate acute COVID-19 morbidity and warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="Human milk-derived extracellular vesicles (HMEVs) are key components in breast milk, promoting infant health and development. Maternal conditions could affect HMEV cargo; however, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HMEVs remains unknown. This study investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on postpartum HMEV molecules. The median duration from SARS-CoV-2 test positivity to milk collection was 3 months. After defatting and casein micelle disaggregation, HMEVs were isolated from milk samples of nine mothers with prenatal SARS-CoV-2 and six controls by sequential centrifugation, ultrafiltration, and qEV-size exclusion chromatography. The presence of HMEV was confirmed via transmission electron microscopy. Nanoparticle tracking analysis demonstrated particle diameters of <200 nm and yields of >1 × 1011 particles per mL of milk. Western immunoblots detected ALIX, CD9, and HSP70, supporting the presence of HMEVs in the isolates. Cargo from thousands of HMEVs were analyzed using a multi-omics approach, including proteomics and microRNA sequencing, and predicted that mothers with prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection produced HMEVs with enhanced functionalities involving metabolic reprogramming, mucosal tissue development, and immunomodulation. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy boosts mucosal site-specific functions of HMEVs, potentially protecting infants against viral infections. Further prospective studies should be pursued to reevaluate the short- and long-term benefits of breastfeeding in the post-COVID era.">

        <tr id="Interpreting viral mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 based on human body level is critical for developing more efficient interventions. Due to the limitation of data, limited models consider the viral dynamics of early phase of infection. The Human Challenge Study Killingley et al. (2022) enables us to garner data from the inoculation to the 14th day after the infection, which provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 within host infection dynamics. In the Human Challenge Study, each volunteer was inoculated with 10TCID50, approximately 55PFU, of a wild type of virus (Killingley et al. (2022)), and the data indicates that the viral load reduced below the detectable level within a day. The simplified within host models developed by Xu et al. (2023) explain the data from the Human Challenge Study (Killingley et al. (2022)). However, they do not explain the viral decay from Day 0 to Day 1. Hence, in this paper, we aim to develop a new viral mechanism to explain this phenomenon. Based on the simplified within host models developed by Xu et al. (2023), we consider that the virus will first go through an adjustment phase and then start to replicate. A new dose-response model is developed to evaluate the probability of infection by constructing a boundary problem. We will discuss this viral mechanism and fit the model to the data of the Human Challenge Study (Killingley et al. (2022)) by adopting AMC-SMC (approximate Bayesian computation-sequential Monte Carlo). Based on the results of parameter inference, we estimate that the adjusted viral load is around 1% of the inoculated viral load.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a pathogen that primarily targets the respiratory system and can lead to severe conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, three—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2—are associated with severe illness and significant morbidity. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cellular entry. The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly mutable, leading to the emergence of variants that alter disease pathology and transmission dynamics. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified these mutations into variants of concern (VOCs), variants of interest (VOIs), and variants under monitoring (VUMs). This review provides an in-depth analysis of both historical and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, summarizes recent advancements in diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and discusses current therapeutic strategies for COVID-19, with a particular focus on virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines developed in recent years. Additionally, we highlight ongoing therapeutic approaches and their implications for managing COVID-19.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, often leading to long-term kidney dysfunction. However, the transcriptomic features of AKI severity and its long-term effects are underexplored.


METHODS
We performed bulk RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and complemented these findings with proteomic data from the same cohort. We compared the functional enrichment findings with historical sepsis-AKI data and subsequently examined the association between molecular signatures and long-term kidney function changes.


RESULTS
In 283 patients, 57 had mild AKI (stage 1) and 49 had severe AKI (stage 2 or 3). Following adjustments for age, sex, severity of infection, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), we identified 6,432 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the severe AKI vs. control comparison, 840 in the mild AKI vs. control, and 1,213 in the severe vs. mild AKI comparison (FDR<0.05). Common pathways included unfolded protein response, cellular response to stress via eIF2, and IFN-g-mediated inflammatory response. Severe AKI was linked to pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Proteomic analysis confirmed 40 established AKI and inflammation biomarkers, while gene-set enrichment of transcription regulators revealed additional biomarkers for severe AKI. Comparison with PBMC transcriptomics from sepsis-related AKI showed significant functional overlap (30%). Analysis of post-discharge eGFR data in 115 patients identified 177 DEGs for severe vs. control, 106 for mild vs. control, and 46 for severe vs. mild AKI. Key associations included kidney function decline related to carbohydrate and mitochondrial metabolism, inflammatory-response, and cardiovascular regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate that severe AKI in SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. The functional overlap with sepsis-AKI suggests potential broader therapeutic applicability. Long-term kidney dysfunction is influenced by disruptions in cellular energy metabolism and immune response.">

        <tr id="Monocytes and macrophages, as important constituents of the innate immune system, are equipped with multiple Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) to recognize invading pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, and mount an antiviral response. Nevertheless, their uncontrolled activation can lead to hyperinflammation seen in severe COVID-19. Surprisingly, we observed that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins triggered only a weak proinflammatory response in human peripheral blood monocytes. By employing THP-1 and Jurkat NF-κB::eGFP reporter cell lines expressing specific TLRs, various TLR ligands and blocking antibodies, we determined that surface TLRs, including TLR2/1, TLR2/6 and TLR4 do not play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 sensing. However, monocytes are potently activated by the replication-competent SARS-CoV-2, and the response correlates with the viral uptake that is observed only in monocytes, but not in lymphocytes. We show that monocyte activation involves two distinct steps. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 infects monocytes in a process independent of the S protein and the prime SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Instead, the alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor CD147, which is highly expressed on monocytes, recognizes its well-known interaction partners cyclophilins A and B that are incorporated into SARS-CoV-2 virions. Secondly, upon viral uptake via the cyclophilin-CD147 interaction, that can be inhibited by specific CD147 blocking antibodies or competition with recombinant human cyclophilin A and B, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recognized by TLR7/8 in endosomes, leading to upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, comprising the core hyperinflammatory signature. Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism how human monocytes sense SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting the cyclophilin-CD147 axis might be beneficial to alleviate overt myeloid-driven inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses have been reported in the literature but have shown mixed evidence in clinical outcomes. With SARS-CoV-2 evolving into mild Omicron variants, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, which in turn affect the epidemiology and clinical course of respiratory viral infections. In response to these changes, multiplex molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses are attracting more attention in the field and have been developed into a variety of testing modalities. In this review, we describe the seasonality (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere), epidemiology, and clinical significance of traditional respiratory viruses and their co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the post-COVID era. Furthermore, we review commonly used multiplex molecular tests and their applications for the detection of respiratory viruses and their co-infections. Altogether, this review not only sheds light on the epidemiology and clinical significance of respiratory viral infections and co-infections in the post-COVID era, and but also provides insights into the laboratory-based diagnoses of respiratory viral infections using multiplex molecular testing.">

        <tr id="Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a rising incidence over time. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in LSCC development, yet the precise cellular characteristics of laryngeal cancer and its TME remain unclear. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to uncover the heterogeneous populations of tumor and immune cells and investigate the role of the TME in LSCC. This analysis revealed significant heterogeneity among malignant cells, T cells, and macrophages. Notably, regulatory T cells were markedly increased at tumor sites, and macrophage analysis identified an increased presence of the Macrophage-C1-C1QC subset with up-regulated PPIF expression. Bulk RNA-seq further confirmed PPIF up-regulation in exosomes derived from LSCC tissues. Consistently, survival analysis indicated that high PPIF expression was associated with poor prognosis in LSCC. Further analyses suggested that PPIF up-regulation in Macrophage-C1-C1QC cells was associated with the enhancement of their anti-inflammatory phenotype and the promotion of F11R-F11R signaling with malignant cells, allowing LSCC cells to evade macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity. Our study provides new insights into the cellular dynamics of LSCC and highlights the critical role of Macrophage-C1-C1QC and PPIF in LSCC progression, offering potential therapeutic targets for treatment.

        <tr id="CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. While most infected people experienced mild illness, others progressed to severe disease, characterized by hyperinflammation and respiratory distress. There is still much to learn about the innate immune response to this virus. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor that is activated when pattern recognition receptors detect viruses. Upon activation, IRF3 induces the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) and interferon-stimulated genes, which protect the host from viral infection. However, coronaviruses antagonize this pathway, delaying type 1 IFN production. It is, therefore, unclear how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. Our prior reports showed that IRF3 promotes harmful inflammation during bacterial sepsis in mice. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that IRF3 cannot effectively control the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and instead promotes harmful inflammation during severe COVID-19. METHODS AND MODELS: We used mice transgenic for the human angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 transgene, driven by the keratin 18 promoter (K18-ACE2 mice) that were IRF3 deficient or IRF3 sufficient to test how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, K18-ACE2 mice showed a dose-dependent disease, characterized by mortality, lethargy, weight loss, and lung pathology, reminiscent of clinical COVID-19. However, K18-ACE2 mice lacking IRF3 were protected from severe disease with reduced mortality (84.6% vs. 100%) and disease score. We found that IRF3 promoted IFN-β production in the lungs and reprogrammed the cytokine profile, while viral load in the lungs was similar in the presence or absence of IRF3. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that IRF3 played a detrimental role in murine COVID-19 associated with changes in IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines.">

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)/sputum showed ongoing viral replication, despite repeated nasopharyngeal swabs being negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. The patients failed to develop seroconversion of IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. However, they showed favorable clinical outcomes after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or molnupiravir, despite the antiviral therapies being initiated later in the clinical course. Our case highlights that in immunocompromised hosts, viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in lung tissue may lag behind that in the upper respiratory tract. Thus, alternative diagnostic criteria are necessary, and clinical decisions and interventions should be tailored to each individual case.">

        <tr id="Excessive inflammation and cytokine release are hallmarks of severe COVID-19. Certain programmed cell death processes can drive inflammation, however, their role in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is unclear. Pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of regulated cell death initiated by inflammasomes and executed by the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). Using an established mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus and a panel of gene-targeted mice we found that deletion of the inflammasome (NLRP1/3 and the adaptor ASC) and pore forming proteins involved in pyroptosis (GSDMA/C/D/E) only marginally reduced IL-1β levels and did not impact disease outcome or viral loads. Furthermore, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not trigger GSDMD activation in mouse lungs. Finally, we did not observe any difference between WT animals and mice with compound deficiencies in the pro-inflammatory initiator caspases (C1/11/12-/-). This indicates that the classical canonical and non-canonical pro-inflammatory caspases known to process and activate pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and GSDMD do not substantially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. However, the loss of IL-1β, but not the absence of IL-18, ameliorated disease and enhanced survival in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals compared to wildtype mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that IL-1β is an important factor contributing to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, but its release was largely independent of inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways.">

        <tr id="The progression of COVID-19 involves a sophisticated and intricate interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host’s immune response. The immune system employs both innate and adaptive mechanisms to combat infection. Innate immunity initiates the release of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the adaptive immune response involves CD4+ Th lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and CD8+ Tc cells. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), activating the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling pathway, a crucial component of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This pathway fulfills a dual function during infection. In the early phase of infection, the virus can suppress cGAS-STING signaling to avoid immune detection. However, in the late stages, the activation of this pathway may trigger excessive inflammation and tissue damage, exacerbating disease severity. Modulating the cGAS-STING pathway, whether through agonists like dimeric amidobenzimidazole (diABZI) or inhibitors targeting viral proteins, such as 3CLpro, for example, offers a promising approach for personalized therapy to control the immune response and mitigate severe inflammation, ultimately improving clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Chagas disease remains a significant public health concern, with limited treatment options and an urgent need for novel preventive strategies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from Trypanosoma cruzi have been shown to modulate host immune responses, often favoring parasite persistence. In this study, we characterized EVs derived from the non-pathogenic trypanosomatids Trypanosoma rangeli and Phytomonas serpens and evaluated their potential as immunogens capable of inducing cross-protection against T. cruzi infection. Isolated EVs were characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) and electron microscopy. A comparative proteomic analysis of EVs was performed using Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomic Analysis (LC-MS/MS). The effects of EVs on immunomodulation and T. cruzi infection were assessed through in vitro and in vivo assays, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and BALB/c mice. The proteomic analysis identified shared proteins between the EVs of T. rangeli, P. serpens, and T. cruzi, including immunogenic candidates such as calpain-like cysteine peptidase and elongation factor 2. In vitro, pre-stimulation with the T. rangeli EVs reduced infection rates of the host cells by T. cruzi. In vivo, immunization with the EVs from T. rangeli and P. serpens led to a significant reduction in parasitemia in the BALB/c mice challenged with T. cruzi, though this did not translate into improved survival compared to controls. Interestingly, the EVs from T. cruzi also reduced parasitemia but did not confer protection against mortality. These findings suggest that while non-pathogenic trypanosomatid EVs exhibit potential immunogenic properties and can reduce parasitic load, their efficacy in preventing disease progression remains limited. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying these effects and to optimize EV-based strategies for protective immunity against Chagas disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Co‐infection with HIV and SARS‐CoV‐2 presents a complex clinical picture. Deciphering the immune response in this population, particularly the role of cytokines underlying immunopathogenesis could elucidates the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Methods This prospective, two‐stage study enrolled 75 individuals with HIV diagnosed with COVID‐19 (case group) and 25 individuals from the general population infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 only (control group). COVID‐19 diagnosis followed World Health Organization guidelines. Plasma cytokine levels were measured using a cytokine bead array. Results The case group skewed slightly females (61.2% vs. 42.9% female in the control group) an average age of 3 years older (44.13 years vs. 40.86 years). Importantly, all the case group participants had mild complications, while a significant majority (88.1%) in the control group experienced severe complications. The control group displayed a substantially higher IgM titer 963 IU/mL compared to only 39.3 IU/mL in the case group. The control group had significantly higher levels of IL‐6, IL‐10, IFN‐γ, TNF‐α compared to the case group. Conclusion This study suggests a potentially distinct immune response in HIV‐positive patients when infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Elucidating these differences could lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.">

        <tr id="Animal models are indispensable for unraveling the mechanisms underlying post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). This review evaluates recent research on PASC-related perturbations in animal models, drawing comparisons with clinical findings. Despite the limited number of studies on post-COVID conditions, particularly those extending beyond three months, these studies provide valuable insights. Three hallmark features of PASC—lung fibrosis, hyperglycemia, and neurological sequelae—have been successfully replicated in animal models, paving the way for mechanistic discoveries and future medical interventions. Although most studies have reported post-COVID conditions within 14–60 days post-infection, they still offer critical reference for future long-term research. This review also explores potential mechanisms of persisting immune misfiring, a key factor in the chronicity of PASC symptoms. Moreover, challenges in modeling PASC are also discussed, including the limited genetic diversity in inbred animal strains and difficulties in accurately identifying PASC-affected individuals. To address these issues, we propose methodological improvements, such as comparing individual animal parameters with control averages and incorporating genetically diverse populations like collaborative cross models. These strategies will enhance the identification and characterization of PASC endotypes in animal studies. By integrating findings from animal models with clinical manifestations of PASC, future research can provide more valuable insights into its mechanisms and support the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need for longitudinal studies in animal models to fully uncover the mechanisms driving PASC and guide interventions to mitigate its public health impact.">

Understanding the demographic, clinical, and immunological differences between individuals with and without long COVID-19 is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This observational study included 206 participants, comprising 90 patients with long COVID-19 and 116 without. Data on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were collected, alongside immune cell profiles and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Statistical analyses compared these parameters between the two groups. Long COVID-19 patients were predominantly female (77.8%), older (47.78% aged 41–60, 20% >60 years), and had higher BMI, hypertension (31.1%), and autoimmune diseases (11.1%) compared to nonlong COVID-19 individuals (P < 0.001). Clinical symptoms unique to long COVID-19 included memory loss (40.0%), hair loss (37.8%), fatigue (35.6%), and myalgia/arthralgia (28.9%), all absent in the control group (P < 0.001). Immunologically, patients with long COVID-19 exhibited distinct immune profiles, including elevated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+), reduced B cells, and higher CD4/CD8 ratios. Moreover, long COVID-19 patients had higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, with 15.5% showing levels between 1000–2500 BAU/ml, compared to 6.9% in controls. These immunological biomarkers, including altered T cell subsets and antibody levels, highlight the complex immune dysregulation associated with long COVID-19. These findings could inform future clinical management and therapeutic strategies targeting immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to an emerging health challenge known as long COVID, also known as PASC, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, characterized by symptoms that persist beyond the acute phase of infection. While acute COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique patterns of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID">

This review explores how blood-brain barrier disruption allows peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), worsening neuroinflammation and disease progression. We examine recent findings on interactions between peripheral immune cells and CNS-resident microglia, forming a self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle leading to neuronal dysfunction. Moreover, this review emphasizes recent developments in the dysregulation of immune factors from both the periphery and CNS, and their impact on AD progression. With ongoing research and development of new therapeutic strategies, this review underscores the importance of modulating interactions between the peripheral immune system and CNS in AD therapy.">

        <tr id="The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post-stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p-MCAO]) is utilized to profile single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain-resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post-stroke disease-related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease-associated microglia, possibly arising from pre-existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post-stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

        <tr id="Background In tuberculosis (TB) infection, monocytes play a crucial role in regulating the balance between immune tolerance and immune response through various mechanisms. A deeper understanding of the roles of monocyte subsets in TB immune responses may facilitate the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies and improve TB prevention and treatment. Methods We retrieved and processed raw single-cell RNA-seq data from SRP247583. Single-cell RNA-seq combined with bioinformatics analysis was employed to investigate the roles of monocytes in TB progression. Results Our findings revealed that classical monocytes expressing inflammatory mediators increased as the disease progressed, whereas non-classical monocytes expressing molecules associated with anti-pathogen infection were progressively depleted. Pseudotime analysis delineated the differentiation trajectory of monocytes from classical to intermediate to non-classical subsets. An abnormal differentiation trajectory to non-classical monocytes may represent a key mechanism underlying TB pathogenesis, with CEBPB and CORO1A identified as genes potentially related to TB development. Analysis of key transcription factors in non-classical monocytes indicated that IRF9 was the only downregulated transcription factor with high AUC activity in this subset. The expression of IRF9 exhibited a decreasing trend in both latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB groups. Furthermore, dysregulation of transcription factor regulatory networks appeared to impair ferroptosis, with ferroptosis-associated genes MEF2C, MICU1, and PRR5 identified as potential targets of IRF9. Through cell communication analysis, we found that interactions between non-classical monocytes and other subpopulations may mediate TB progression, with MIF and LGALS9 highlighted as potential signaling pathways. Conclusion This study employs bioinformatics analysis in conjunction with single-cell sequencing technology to uncover the crucial role of monocyte subsets in tuberculosis infection.

        <tr id="Introduction Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by irreversible airflow limitation and systemic immune impacts. COPD patients demonstrate an increased susceptibility to sepsis and septic shock, underscoring the importance of understanding its effects on splenic function. Methods A rat COPD model was established using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cigarette smoke exposure. Splenic function was assessed through carbon clearance assays, histological analysis, and high-throughput mRNA sequencing. In vitro assays were conducted to evaluate the role of secretoglobin family 1a member 1 (SCGB1A1) in macrophage activation and lymphocyte proliferation. Results Carbon clearance assays revealed a significant reduction in splenic phagocytic activity in the smoke-exposed group. Histological analysis showed lymphoid follicle atrophy and connective tissue hyperplasia. High-throughput mRNA sequencing identified 102 upregulated and 32 downregulated genes in the smoke-exposed group, with SCGB1A1 notably upregulated. In vitro assays confirmed that SCGB1A1 inhibits LPS-induced macrophage activation and Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Conclusion These findings suggest that SCGB1A1 contributes to splenic immune dysfunction in COPD. Targeted inhibition of SCGB1A1 expression in the spleen may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of sepsis in COPD patients.">

        <tr id="Since SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented changes in the epidemiology of other infectious diseases, investigations on coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and one of the famous vector-borne diseases, malaria, are crucial for disease control, especially in malaria-endemic areas. The clinical profiles, possible mechanisms for interactions, and representative control measures of COVID-19 and malaria coinfections have recently garnered public attention. The overlap in epidemiology, infection incubation, and clinical symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria coinfections has been thoroughly discussed to provide a detailed diagnostic procedure for coinfections, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions. Immunological and genetic evidence has shown that previous malaria exposure may protect the body from the poor prognosis of COVID-19. ACE2 downregulation and TLR-induced pathways play a role in this protective effect, as do CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell activation and coinhibitory receptor upregulation, which help maintain a balance of immune reactions. Finally, multiple control measures for coinfections were discussed, and malaria control efforts were enriched in the context of COVID-19. These efforts included (1) developing vaccinations; (2) evaluating the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment; (3) exploring recent advances in natural products that are potentially useful for coinfection treatment; (4) researching and implementing bioinsecticides for malaria control, such as gene-driven mosquitoes, fungi, and bacterial symbionts; and (5) improving national electronic disease surveillance platforms in malaria-endemic regions. At last, the above findings summarized valuable lessons about malaria and COVID-19 control and expedite further investigations on coinfections with complex clinical presentations.

        <tr id="Background Severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by an excessive presence of neutrophils. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), released by activated neutrophils due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, contribute to lung epithelial cell death and are key drivers in COVID-19-associated immunothrombosis. However, the mechanism underlying NET formation in COVID-19 remain unclear. Methods Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from the serum of COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers, while neutrophils were isolated from blood samples of healthy volunteers. Neutrophils were treated with EVs, and the formation of NETs was observed. To identify the components responsible for the COVID-19-EVs-induced NET formation, we analyzed the expression profiles of microRNA (miRNAs) in COVID-19-EVs. We identified eight highly expressed miRNAs in COVID-19-EVs and explored their potential roles in COVID-19-EVs-mediated NET formation. Additionally, we explored the role of miR-20b-5p in COVID-19-EVs-induced NET formation. Results In this study, we demonstrate that patients with COVID-19 have a higher concentration of serum EVs (COVID-19-EVs) than healthy controls (Normal-EVs). We also found that COVID-19-EVs are internalized by neutrophils to induced NET formation. Through comprehensive miRNA profiling of COVID-19-EVs versus Normal-EVs, we identified 78 differentially expressed miRNAs, with 27 of these being upregulated and 51 being downregulated. Subsequently, we discovered that COVID-19-EVs that were highly abundant with certain miRNAs promote NET formation. Specifically, miR-20b-5p was found to be the strongest inducer of NET formation of the identified miRNAs. Inhibition of miR-20b-5p resulted in a significant decrease in COVID-19-EVs-mediated induction of NET formation. Conclusion Herein, we reveal a previously unknown role of COVID-19-EVs in NET formation, which contributes to COVID-19 progression. This study suggests that miR-20b-5p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment.

        <tr id="Background and objectives Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) bring cancer patients tumor control and survival benefits, yet they also trigger immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), notably checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP), affecting about 5% of patients among whom 1–2% experiencing severe grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Current research points to potential links with T cell subset dysfunction and autoantibody increase, but the specific mechanisms underlying different grades of CIP are understudied. Methods Herein, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from CIP patients across varying severity levels, aiming to elucidate underlying immune environment and mechanisms of CIP progression at cellular and molecular levels. Findings Totally, 121,409 high qualified cells from BALF of 11 patients were annotated and categorized into five major cell types. Severe CIP (CIP-S) cases have a significant increase in the percentage of unreported epithelial cells in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with mild CIP (CIP-M) cases. These cells were defined as aberrant basaloid cells. They upregulated SOX9, increased the expression of CXCL3/5, recruited neutrophils, and activated the immune system. Additionally, macrophages in the CIP-S group had stronger antigen-presenting abilities and resulted in more CD8 + effective T cells infiltrated. Conclusions Utilizing single-cell sequencing of BALF, we discovered an enriched population of aberrant basaloid cells in CIP-S patients, which had not been previously reported. Aberrant basaloid cells may upregulate SOX9 via CXCL3/5-CXCR2 to recruit and activate neutrophils, and further activate the immune system, resulting in CIP-S. This finding could identify new targets for stratified treatment of CIP patients, holding promise of a novel approach for clinical guidance.

        <tr id="Long COVID has emerged as a significant challenge since the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared as an outbreak in March 2020, marked by diverse symptoms and prolonged duration of disease. Defined by the WHO as symptoms persisting or emerging for at least two months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection without an alternative cause, its prevalence varies globally, with estimates of 10–20% in Europe, 7.3% in the USA, and 3.0% in the UK. The condition’s etiology remains unclear, involving factors, such as renin–angiotensin system overactivation, persistent viral reservoirs, immune dysregulation, and autoantibodies. Reactivated viruses, like EBV and HSV-6, alongside epigenetic alterations, exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and energy imbalance. Emerging evidence links SARS-CoV-2 to chromatin and gut microbiome changes, further influencing long-term health impacts. Diagnosis of long COVID requires detailed systemic evaluation through medical history and physical examination. Management is highly individualized, focusing mainly on the patient’s symptoms and affected systems. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, integrating diverse perspectives to address systemic manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Enhanced understanding of long COVID’s pathophysiology and clinical features is critical to improving patient outcomes and quality of life. With a growing number of cases expected globally, advancing research and disseminating knowledge on long COVID remain vital for developing effective diagnostic and management frameworks, ultimately supporting better care for affected individuals.">

        <tr id="Abstract Molecules of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) are key players in immune regulation; an increase in some TNFSF molecules has been reported during severe COVID‐19. In this study, we profiled and evaluated TNFSF members in the serum of COVID‐19 vaccine‐naïve patients to identify potential biomarkers associated with disease severity. Our data show that TRAIL serum levels are lower in severely affected patients than those mildly affected by COVID‐19 (AUC 0.8, p = 0.0003). On the contrary, OPG and BAFF serum levels are higher in severe COVID‐19 compared to mild COVID‐19 cases (AUC 0.8, p = 0.0001; AUC 0.7, p = 0.0012; respectively) and moderate COVID‐19 cases (OPG p < 0.01), BAFF (p < 0.05). At the transcriptional level, TRAIL, OPG and BAFF are elevated in severe compared to mild COVID‐19 cases, with OPG and BAFF also higher in moderate compared to mild COVID‐19 patients. Additionally, we found that APRIL, LIGHT, CD30L and CD40L protein‐levels are higher in COVID‐19 patients compared to healthy donors but not significantly different between various COVID‐19 clinical statuses. Finally, we found that TNF‐α, TNF‐β, RANKL and TWEAK protein levels were not affected during COVID‐19. Our work identifies OPG and BAFF as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for preventing severe COVID‐19. Due to the opposite contradictory levels of TRAIL (protein/transcriptional level), its role during COVID‐19 should be elucidated and clarified with more in‐depth studies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Ischemic stroke (IS) represents a significant global health challenge, characterized by elevated morbidity and mortality rates, largely driven by inflammatory responses. Double-negative T cells (DNTs), a distinct subset of T cells lacking both CD4 and CD8 markers, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IS, exhibiting potentially dual roles. However, the precise functional contributions of DNTs in this context remain poorly understood. Methods In this study, we investigated the role of DNTs during the acute phase of IS and assessed the influence of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du Decoction (HLJD), a traditional Chinese medicinal formula, on these cells. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we identified two distinct subtypes of DNTs: an activated, cytotoxic phenotype (Kill+) and a resting, immunosuppressive phenotype (Kill-). Results Our findings indicate that HLJD treatment modulates the balance between these DNT subtypes, specifically reducing the proportion of cytotoxic DNTs while promoting an increase in immunosuppressive DNTs. This shift was associated with a reduction in immune cell infiltration and inflammation within the brain tissue, potentially mitigating neuronal damage. Discussion These results suggest that HLJD exerts neuroprotective effects in IS by modulating the activity and distribution of DNT cells, offering valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of IS. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying DNT-mediated immune responses in IS and to explore the broader applications of HLJD in other neuroinflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved over short timescales, leading to the emergence of more transmissible variants such as Alpha and Delta1–3. The arrival of the Omicron variant marked a major shift, introducing numerous extra mutations in the spike gene compared with earlier variants1,2. These evolutionary changes have raised concerns regarding their potential impact on immune evasion, disease severity and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments1,3. In this epidemiological study, we identified two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron versus pre-Omicron eras. Before Omicron, natural infection provided strong and durable protection against reinfection, with minimal waning over time. However, during the Omicron era, protection was robust only for those recently infected, declining rapidly over time and diminishing within a year. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by a dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution, leading to contrasting reinfection patterns before and after Omicron’s first wave. This shift in patterns suggests a change in evolutionary pressures, with intrinsic transmissibility driving adaptation pre-Omicron and immune escape becoming dominant post-Omicron, underscoring the need for periodic vaccine updates to sustain immunity.">

Among the organs, gastrointestinal tract, brain, cardiovascular system, liver, kidneys, microcirculation, eyes, and so on, cytokine storms can harm Considering the everyday mortality, research on targeted antiviral medicine compositions and vaccination production is under progress. Prebiotics seem to be immunomodulators and antiviral agents, therefore strengthening the human immune system according recent scientific data. Prebiotics enhanced the maturation, differentiation, and lymphocyte and macrophage proliferation, thereby increasing COVID-19 immunity. They also triggered the reticuloendothelial system, raised the fraction of CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), and improved COVID-19 immunity by this means. Dietary interventions like prebiotics and anti-SARS-CoV-2 have opened opportunities for the development of microbial therapeutics intended either to prevent or treat COVID-19. Prebiotics are specialized dietary components necessary for the survival and nutritional absorption of gut probiotic microorganisms.">

        <tr id="Platelets, known for maintaining blood balance, also participate in antimicrobial defense. Upon severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, platelets become hyperactivated, releasing molecules such as cytokines, granule contents, and bioactive lipids. The key effector biolipids produced by platelets include 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), produced by 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), and prostaglandins and thromboxane, produced by cyclooxygenase-1. While prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 were previously associated with lung inflammation in severe COVID-19, the role of platelet 12-LOX in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using mice deficient for platelets' 12-LOX, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in higher lung inflammation characterized by histopathological tissue analysis, increased leukocyte infiltrates, and cytokine production relative to wild-type mice. In addition, distinct platelet and lung transcriptomic changes, including alterations in NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome-related gene expression, were observed. Mass spectrometry lipidomic analysis in 12-LOX-deficient-infected mice revealed significant changes in bioactive lipid content, including reduced levels of 12-HETrE that inversely correlated with disease severity. Finally, platelet 12-LOX deficiency was associated with increased morbidity and lower survival rates relative to wild type (WT) mice. Overall, this study highlights the complex interplay between 12-LOX-related lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating severe outcomes, emphasizing the pivotal role of platelet enzymes in the host response to viral infections.">

        <tr id="Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduces hospitalization and mortality, its long-term impact on Long-COVID remains to be elucidated. The aim of the study was to evaluate the different development of Long-COVID clinical phenotypes according to the vaccination status of patients. Clinical and demographic characteristics were assessed for each patient, while Long-COVID symptoms were self-reported and later stratified into distinct clinical phenotypes. Vaccination was significantly associated with the avoidance of hospitalization, less invasive respiratory support, and less alterations of cardiopulmonary functions, as well as reduced lasting lung parenchymal damage. However, no association between vaccination status and the development of at least one Long-COVID symptom was found. Nevertheless, clinical phenotypes were differently associated with vaccination status, as neuropsychiatric were more frequent in unvaccinated patients and cardiorespiratory symptoms were reported mostly in vaccinated patients. Different progression of disease could be at play in the different development of specific Long-COVID clinical phenotypes, as shown by the different serological responses between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients. A higher anti-Spike (S) antibody titre was protective for vaccinated patients, while it was detrimental for unvaccinated patients. A better understanding of the mechanism underlying the development of Long-COVID symptoms might be reached by standardized methodologies and symptom classification.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The COVID‐19 pandemic has left an indelible mark on the world, with mounting evidence suggesting that it not only posed acute challenges to global healthcare systems but has also unveiled a complex array of long‐term consequences, particularly cognitive impairment (CI). As the persistence of post‐COVID‐19 neurological syndrome could evolve into the next public health crisis, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of the intricate pathophysiology of CI in COVID‐19 patients and viable treatment strategies. Methods This comprehensive review explores the pathophysiology and management of cognitive impairment across the phases of COVID‐19, from acute infection to Long‐COVID, by synthesizing findings from clinical, preclinical, and mechanistic studies to identify key contributors to CI, as well as current therapeutic approaches. Results Key mechanisms contributing to CI include persistent neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular complications, direct neuronal injury, activation of the kynurenine pathway, and psychological distress. Both pharmacological interventions, such as anti‐inflammatory therapies and agents targeting neuroinflammatory pathways, and non‐pharmacological strategies, including cognitive rehabilitation, show promise in addressing these challenges. Although much of the current evidence is derived from preclinical and animal studies, these findings provide foundational insights into potential treatment approaches. Conclusion By synthesizing current knowledge, this review highlights the importance of addressing COVID‐19‐related cognitive impairment and offers actionable insights for mitigation and recovery as the global community continues to grapple with the pandemic's long‐term impact.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 is an oral pathogen that infects and replicates in mucosal and salivary epithelial cells, contributing to oral post‐acute sequelae COVID‐19 (PASC) and other oral and non‐oral pathologies. While pre‐existing inflammatory oral diseases provides a conducive environment for the virus, acute infection and persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 can also results in oral microbiome dysbiosis that further worsens poor oral mucosal health. Indeed, oral PASC includes periodontal diseases, dysgeusia, xerostomia, pharyngitis, oral keratoses, and pulpitis suggesting significant bacterial contributions to SARS‐CoV‐2 and oral tissue tropism. Dysbiotic microbiome‐induced inflammation can promote viral entry via angiotensin‐converting enzyme receptor‐2 (ACE2), serine transmembrane TMPRSS2 and possibly other non‐canonical pathways. Additionally, metabolites derived from a dysbiotic microbiome can alter the physiological and biochemical pathways related to the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This may promote a pro‐inflammatory microenvironment, leading to immune exhaustion, loss of tolerance, and susceptibility to a variety of oral pathogens, causing acute and later chronic inflammation. Microbial release of mimics of host metallopeptidases related to furin, ADAM17 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17), and glycoprotein metabolites can further aid viral attachment to T cell immunoglobulin‐like (TIMs), enhancing viral entry while simultaneously depressing oral mucosal immune resistance and clearance. Membrane reorganization characterised by neuroproteins, such as neuropilins, also functionally assists with SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and extends the pathogenesis of PASC from the oral cavity to the brain, gut, or other non‐oral tissues. Thus, poor oral health, characterised by disrupted oral microbiomes can promote viral tropism, weaken antiviral resistance, and heightens susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This immune dysfunction also increases the risk of additional viral infections, exacerbating oral conditions like periodontal and endodontic diseases. These persistent oral health issues can contribute to systemic inflammation, creating bidirectional effects between oral and non‐oral tissues, potentially leading to Post‐Acute Sequelae of COVID‐19 (PASC).">

        <tr id="T-cell ageing may be a key factor in the disproportionate severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older populations. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients, treatment involving the use of monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 usually involves the administration of high doses but has not been very effective at preventing complications or fatality, highlighting the need for additional research into anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, particularly for older populations. In this study, it is discovered that older persons with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has weaker T-cell responses. Therefore the development and characterization of spike-targeting T-cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) full-length human immunoglobulin Gs with enhanced efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is described. Using S-targeting TDBs, polyclonal T cells are guided to target and destroy S-expressing cells, preventing the cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby eliminating the need for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Using animal models of COVID-19, it is shown that the selective activation of T cells improves the efficiency of treatment in preinfected mice by attenuating disease-induced weight loss and death. The significance of T-cell-based immunity during infection is highlighted by the findings. These results have implications for better clinical effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 and the development of T-cell-dependent medicines for the elderly population.">

An ominous turn in the pandemic is the evolving public health crisis emanating from persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated long-term impact. Long COVID or post–COVID syndrome describes protean symptoms that persist at least 3 months after the onset of acute illness and last for at least 2 months in individuals with a history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Long COVID has become a public health concern. Millions of infected individuals are now facing chronic multi-organ failures, including neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and kidney complications. In general, the cause of long COVID syndrome is unclear but factors such as prolonged activation of immune responses, and viral persistence triggering transcription dysregulation of genes associated with normal thrombotic disease may play a role in cardiovascular complications. Although inflammatory biomarkers are reported in other disorders, it remains unclear whether similar biomarkers are associated with cardiovascular manifestations following COVID. Medications such as sulodexide directed at glycocalyx and coagulation have demonstrated benefits for long COVID in smaller studies. Here, we describe the outcomes of the symposium on the underlying cardiovascular mechanisms of the long COVID.">

        <tr id="Cellular innate immune pathways are formidable barriers against viral invasion, creating an environment unfavorable for virus replication. Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in driving and regulating these cell-intrinsic innate antiviral mechanisms through the action of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The host IFN response obstructs viral replication at every stage, prompting viruses to evolve various strategies to counteract or evade this response. Understanding the interplay between viral proteins and cell-intrinsic IFN-mediated immune mechanisms is essential for developing antiviral and anti-inflammatory strategies. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses, encode a range of proteins that, through shared and distinct mechanisms, inhibit IFN-mediated innate immune responses. Compounding the issue, a dysregulated early IFN response can lead to a hyper-inflammatory immune reaction later in the infection, resulting in severe disease. This review provides a brief overview of HCoV replication and a detailed account of its interaction with host cellular innate immune pathways regulated by IFN.">

        <tr id="The novel H10N3 avian influenza virus (AIV) has infected four individuals since 2021 and caused severe respiratory damage, posing a significant threat to public health. However, its pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our findings revealed that H10N3 infection induces severe lung damage and causes death in mice, even at low doses. The elevated levels of multiple pro-inflammatory factors in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly increased during infection, displaying hallmarks of a cytokine storm. Transcriptome sequencing further revealed systematic activation of inflammation-related pathways, predicting that viral infection induces multiple forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. Protein-level validation showed that the activation of key cell death markers, including Caspase-3, GSDMD, and MLKL, significantly increased as the infection progressed, with their dynamic changes correlating strongly with the expression pattern of viral proteins. This study elucidates the central role of the synergistic effect between the cytokine storm and multiple cell death pathways in H10N3 pathogenesis. These findings not only advance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AIVs but also provide a critical theoretical basis for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.">

While both incomplete Freund’s adjuvants (IFA) and complete Freund’s adjuvants (CFA) influence antibody and T cell responses, the robust T helper 1 cytokines induced by the mycobacterial components make CFA the powerful immunostimulating adjuvant. In these studies, the adjuvant effects are investigated in a select population of cells, and the changes, if any, with the metabolic alterations in the systemic compartment are unclear. We investigated whether the effects of IFA and CFA can be influenced by the metabolic shifts in mice immunized with saline, IFA, or CFA using Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) as a positive control. After seven days of immunization, we analyzed the serum metabolite profiles using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis to identify metabolic features between the groups. The data revealed that, in the scores space, the CFA and BCG groups were more closely aligned compared to the saline group, while the IFA group displayed an intermediate profile. Furthermore, comparisons between the CFA and BCG groups showed more significant perturbations in lipid and amino acid metabolism, particularly involving glycerophospholipids, cysteine, and aromatic amino acids. In contrast, comparisons between the BCG and IFA groups indicated a more pronounced disruption in central energy metabolism pathways, such as the citric acid cycle and pyruvate metabolism. Together, the data suggest that the serum metabolite profiles in response to IFA and CFA might play a role in modulating the immune responses.">

        <tr id="Despite the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, there still remain risks of new aggressive strains of coronavirus. As the human population increases progressively, it is mandatory to ensure both preventive measures and an immediate response to emerging infectious threats. Another essential component for rapidly restraining a new possible pandemic is the development of new anticoronaviral therapeutics. In the present study, the anticoronaviral capabilities of Gc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF) are characterized. It is demonstrated that the administration of GcMAF to Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the first phase of infection (six days postinfection) is accompanied by (i) a statistically significant reduction in the viral load of the lung tissue and (ii) the switching of the inflammatory status of the lung tissue to a neutral one in terms of mRNA expression levels of the groups of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The potential mechanism for this antiviral action and the containment of the inflammatory response by the drug associated with the engagement of terminal N-acetylgalactosamine GcMAF and C-type lectin domain containing 10A expressed at the surface of lung-infiltrating macrophages and pneumocytes, which simultaneously express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is discussed.">

Although age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities are recognized as risk factors, identifying genetic contributors is essential for developing targeted therapies. Methods: We developed a multi-omics framework using Transcriptome-Wide Mendelian Randomization (TWMR) and Control Theory (CT). This approach integrates Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks to detect causal genes and regulatory nodes that drive critical expression changes in Long COVID. Results: We identified 32 causal genes (19 previously reported and 13 novel), which act as regulatory drivers influencing disease risk, progression, and stability. Enrichment analyses highlighted pathways linked to the SARS-CoV-2 response, viral carcinogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and immune function. Analysis of other pathophysiological conditions revealed shared genetic factors across syndromic, metabolic, autoimmune, and connective tissue disorders. Using these genes, we identified three distinct symptom-based subtypes of Long COVID, offering insights for more precise diagnosis and potential therapeutic interventions. Additionally, we provided an open-source Shiny application to enable further data exploration. Conclusion: Integrating TWMR and CT revealed genetic mechanisms and therapeutic targets for Long COVID, with novel genes informing pathogenesis and precision medicine strategies.">

Currently, no therapies effectively regenerate the alveolar epithelium. Here, we describe a feeder- and serum-free primary adult human organoid model to investigate how inflammation influences alveolar regeneration. We achieve long-term expansion of multipotent progenitor-like cells, while an alveolar type 2 (AT2) maturation protocol enhances surfactant production and supports tubular myelin formation. Introducing a LATS inhibitor to the expansion condition induces alveolar type 1 (AT1) differentiation while maintaining AT2 cells. Using this platform, we find that interferon-gamma exerts cytotoxic effects on AT1 cells while promoting the growth of regenerating AT2 cells, illustrating how a single inflammatory stimulus can have divergent effects on alveolar epithelial cell types. These findings underscore the nuanced influence of pro-inflammatory cytokines on alveolar regeneration. Our organoid model provides a reductionist platform for mechanistic studies, aimed to identify strategies to enhance alveolar regeneration.">

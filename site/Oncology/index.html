        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Factors regulating the severity of pneumonitis during viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found higher expression of protein S (PROS1) in lung epithelium of mild compared to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We hypothesized that PROS1 may protect the upper airways by regulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods To test this, in vitro air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary healthy human lung epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2. This model, validated through immunofluorescent staining, confocal microscopy, and single-cell RNA-sequencing, replicated pathogenic changes seen in the lungs of COVID-19. Regulation and secretion of PROS1, along with multiple soluble mediators, were quantified in control and infected cultures using ELISAs. Results We found that PROS1 is present in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium and is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection through an IFN-mediated process. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PROS1 downregulated the SARS-CoV-2-induced proinflammatory phenotypes of basal cells, transforming pathogenic CXCL10/11high into a regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 increased the secretion of M-CSF from epithelial cells, which induced the expression of PROS1 receptor MERTK on monocytes interacting with the lung epithelium. PROS1, in turn, shifted SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenic monocyte phenotypes toward a phenotype with increased MHC class II. Conclusion These findings highlight the crucial role of PROS1 in protecting against severe lung pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2, by reducing epithelial- and monocyte-derived inflammation, promoting pro-repair epithelial phenotypes, and enhancing antigen presentation in myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.">

        <tr id="Development of therapeutic approaches that target specific microglia responses in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is crucial due to the involvement of microglia in ALS progression. Our study identifies the predominant microglia subset in human ALS primary motor cortex and spinal cord as an undifferentiated phenotype with dysregulated respiratory electron transport. Moreover, we find that the interferon response microglia subset is enriched in donors with aggressive disease progression, while a previously described potentially protective microglia phenotype is depleted in ALS. Additionally, we observe an enrichment of non-microglial immune cell, mainly NK/T cells, in the ALS central nervous system, primarily in the spinal cord. These findings pave the way for the development of microglia subset-specific therapeutic interventions to slow or even stop ALS progression.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to global consequences since its emergence in late 2019, impacting health, economies, and societies worldwide. Understanding the early responses following infection will provide crucial insights into the immune mechanisms governing disease progression and protection. We employed the single-cell RNA-sequencing approach using bronchoalveolar lavage cells of rhesus macaques at 0–3 days post-infection (dpi) in a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2. Our results show the increased abundance of two subsets of macrophages that express IFN-responsive gene signatures, inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid DCs, and conventional DCs at 3 dpi, coinciding with peak viremia. Moreover, our investigation underscores the enrichment of IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, and IL-1 signaling pathways within myeloid populations at 2–3 dpi in comparison to baseline. These findings substantially deepen our comprehension, elucidating the transcriptional landscape at the single-cell level during the early phases of COVID-19 within a highly relevant model. IMPORTANCE Understanding the immune response in the early stages of COVID-19 is crucial for developing better treatments and vaccines. In this study, we used advanced single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques, a model for human SARS-CoV-2 infection, within the first few days after infection. We identify key immune cell types, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that are activated early on and produce important signals to fight the virus. These findings help clarify how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 at the single-cell level, offering valuable insights that could guide future therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="While human autopsy samples have provided insights into pulmonary immune mechanisms associated with severe viral respiratory diseases, the mechanisms that contribute to a clinically favorable resolution of viral respiratory infections remain unclear due to the lack of proper experimental systems. Using mice co-engrafted with a genetically matched human immune system and fetal lung xenograft (fLX), we mapped the immunological events defining successful resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues. Viral infection is rapidly cleared from fLX following a peak of viral replication, histopathological manifestations of lung disease and loss of AT2 program, as reported in human COVID-19 patients. Infection resolution is associated with the activation of a limited number of hematopoietic subsets, including inflammatory monocytes and CD3-expressing macrophage-like cells, which are highly enriched in viral RNA and dissipate upon infection resolution. Specific human fibroblast and endothelial subsets also elicit robust antiviral and monocyte chemotaxis signatures, respectively. Notably, systemic depletion of human CD4 + cells, but not CD3 + cells, significantly abrogates infection resolution in fLX and induces persistent infection, supporting the dominant role of peripheral CD4 + monocytes over T-cells in the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings unravel a comprehensive picture of the immunological events defining effective resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues, revealing markedly divergent immunological trajectories between resolving and fatal COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to study how human immune responses develop to a novel viral antigen delivered through different vaccine platforms. However, to date, no study has directly compared immune responses to all three FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines at single-cell multi-omic resolution. We longitudinally profiled SARS-CoV-2–naïve adults (n=31) vaccinated with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S, integrating plasma cytokines, antibody titers, and single-cell multi-omic data (DOGMA-seq). We discovered a distinct, transient interferon program (ISG-dim) that emerged specifically 1–2 days after the first mRNA dose in ~10% of myeloid cells. This state was characterized by ISGF3 complex activation and its target genes (e.g., MX1, MX2, DDX58), with transcriptional and epigenetic profiles distinct from the robust interferon program observed after mRNA boosting or a single Ad26.COV2.S dose (ISG-high). In vitro stimulation of human monocytes showed that IFN-α alone recapitulates ISG-dim, whereas both IFN-α and IFN-γ are required for ISG-high. These findings define dose-dependent interferon programming in human myeloid cells, highlight mechanistic differences between priming and boosting, with implications for optimizing vaccine platform choice, dose scheduling, and formulation.">

        <tr id="Aging significantly influences host immune responses to viral infections, including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Despite its high fatality rate and pandemic potential, effective therapies remain unavailable, and the age-dependent mechanisms underlying SFTSV pathogenesis are not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed a ferret model (an immunocompetent animal model that mimics human SFTSV infections) and performed multi-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing and histopathological analyses. Our results reveal that, upon SFTSV infection, aged ferrets experience extensive decrease of critical immune cells (particularly B and T cells) due to infection-induced cell death and excessive hemophagocytosis in hematopoietic organs, whereas young-adult ferrets rapidly clear the virus with minimal lymphocyte changes. Notably, aged ferrets display marked immune dysregulation, characterized by non-specific activation of T-bet ⁺ age-associated memory B cells (T-bet+ ABCs) and the proliferation of defective plasmablasts (MKI67 ⁺ PB1), which serve as major viral reservoirs and drive systemic viral dissemination. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that the MKI67 ⁺ PB1 subset dominates SFTSV⁺ cells in both aged ferrets and human fatal cases, exhibiting the highest per-cell viral UMI counts. Moreover, monocytes and macrophages in aged ferrets exhibit heightened inflammatory gene expression, contributing to the hyper-inflammatory state observed during infection. Collectively, these insights underscore the critical role of dysregulated memory B cell responses and hyper-inflammation in age-dependent SFTSV pathogenesis, highlighting potential targets for interventions in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The Long COVID syndrome is a major global health problem, affecting approximately 10–20% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus with many remaining symptomatic beyond one year. Fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance and hyperlactataemia on minimal exertion have led to the suggestion of a bioenergetic defect. We hypothesised that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathological feature in Long COVID cases and would correlate with clinical outcome. Methods This prospective, case-controlled, observational study recruited 27 participants with an established diagnosis of Long COVID syndrome from a single tertiary clinic together with 16 age-matched controls aged 25–65 years. Seahorse-based mitochondrial flux analysis and bioenergetics profile of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed and correlated with clinical phenotype. Findings Long COVID cases had an increased baseline and ATP-induced oxygen consumption rate with a significant attenuation in tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate fluorescence response to oligomycin. Correlations were observed between mitochondrial function and autonomic health, quality of life and time from index infection. Sex-specific differences were also observed. Interpretation PBMCs from Long COVID subjects exhibit an exceptional and distinctive change in ATP synthase, as it contributes to the mitochondrial membrane potential rather than using it exclusively to generate ATP. The findings suggest that the enzyme runs both forward and reverse reactions, synthesising and hydrolysing ATP. The correlation of mitochondrial function with clinical phenotype in Long COVID may indicate a causal relationship and warrants further validation in larger scale studies.">

While humanized major histocompatibility complex (hMHC) murine models have been extensively utilized in oncological research, their application in virological studies-particularly for coronavirus pathogenesis-remains underexplored. Methods This study systematically characterized immune responses in SARS-CoV-2-challenged hMHC mice lung tissues through comparative transcriptomic profiling, combined with functional enrichment and PPI network analyses. Results Key findings demonstrate that hMHC mice exhibit enhanced immunological activation relative to wild-type controls, particularly in IFN-γ signaling pathways and neutrophil mobilization dynamics that closely parallel human post-vaccination responses. Comparative analysis with human whole blood RNA-seq datasets revealed that hMHC mice exhibit both high reproducibility in transcriptomic profiles and significant similarity to human immune responses across innate and adaptive immunity. Conclusions These results confirm that the hMHC murine model can serve as an effective platform for vaccine research, providing a theoretical foundation for the application of humanized MHC mice and offering new insights into viral infection mechanisms and the development of novel vaccines.">

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, and accounts for the majority of malaria-associated mortality. Reducing the overwhelming inflammatory responses in the early stage of infection is a key point to prevent death due to CM. In this study, we found that neutrophil mobilization occurred rapidly in response to Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection in a murine CM model. Depletion of neutrophils protected the infected mice from neuropathology, with low infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells in the brain, and attenuated activation of dendritic cell (DC) and parasite-specific T cell responses in the spleen. Flow cytometry analysis showed that following PbA infection the expression of TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 were increased in splenic DC, while only TLR9 expression was reduced after the depletion of neutrophils. To validate the TLR9-dependent activation between neutrophils and DC, we used neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to stimulate bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDC) from WT and Tlr9−/− mice. The results showed that the DNA component of NETs activates DCs through the TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to upregulated expression of costimulatory molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which was abolished by DNase I. BMDC stimulated by NETs promoted CD8+ T cell activation with TLR9 dependence. Inhibiting NETs with Sivelestat effectively impeded the onset and progression of CM in the PbA infected mice. Collectively, our results indicated that neutrophil cell death (NETosis) induced TLR9-dependent DC activation and pathogenic CD8+ T cell responses, revealing that the NETs-TLR9/NF-κB-DC-CD8+ T cell axis may provide novel insights into the immunopathogenic mechanisms of CM.

        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke induces profound neuroinflammation, where microglial activation exacerbates secondary brain injury. Human umbilical mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUMSC-Exos) exhibit therapeutic potential, but their mechanisms in modulating microglial responses remain incompletely understood. Results Following intranasal administration, hUMSC-Exos selectively accumulated in ischemic brain regions and were internalized by microglia. In transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mice, hUMSC-Exos improved neurological outcomes, reduced neuronal apoptosis, and promoted a sustained shift in microglial polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype—evidenced by suppressed pro-inflammatory and elevated anti-inflammatory markers in peri-infarct areas. These effects were replicated in LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated primary microglia and BV2 cells. Microglia-specific RNA sequencing revealed that hUMSC-Exos reversed tMCAO-induced pro-inflammatory and migratory transcriptional programs, concurrently suppressing p38 MAPK while activating immunoregulatory pathways. TREM1 emerged as a critical node, with hUMSC-Exos downregulating its expression in microglia; pharmacological TREM1 inhibition (LP17) synergistically augmented the suppression of microglial activation, migration, and proliferation. Mechanistically, hUMSC-Exos attenuated NF-κB/p38 MAPK signaling, with TREM1 functioning upstream of p38 (validated by overexpression/reversal). Proteomic analysis identified HMGB1 as a key exosomal cargo—its blockade (glycyrrhizin) partially reversed hUMSC-Exos-mediated effects, restoring TREM1 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thus positioning HMGB1 upstream of TREM1. Conclusions Our findings delineate a novel HMGB1-TREM1-p38 MAPK axis through which hUMSC-Exos mitigate post-stroke neuroinflammation. By delivering HMGB1, hUMSC-Exos inhibit TREM1-dependent NF-κB/p38 activation, reprogram microglial function, and confer neuroprotection. Validated across in vivo, primary, and BV2 microglial models, and supported by multi-omics analyses, this study establishes hUMSC-Exos as a promising cell-free therapy targeting microglial reprogramming for ischemic stroke recovery.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Analyzing the antiviral response of natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes is essential to understanding vaccine protection in an immunized population facing SARS-CoV-2 variant breakthrough infections (BTIs). In this study, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections, we observed an increase in adaptive CD57+NKG2C+ NK cells and classical monocytes (CMs). Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that the transcriptomic profiles of IFN-induced IFIT3 and other IFN-stimulated genes exhibited marked upregulation in NK cells, defined as CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+IFIT3+ NK cells. Additionally, CM in the blood showed characteristics indicative of differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which further evidenced their potential antiviral functions. Our study indicates that a vaccinated population rapidly activates an antiviral innate immune response following a BTI, thus revealing a link to the control of viral replication during SARS-CoV-2 BTIs.">

        <tr id="Comprehensive characterization of bovine immune cell populations is essential for improving animal welfare and disease resilience. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on over 29,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Angus cattle stratified by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), a proxy for the cellular immune response (Cell-IR). Unsupervised clustering identified major immune populations including CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Differential gene expression suggests that low Cell-IR cattle have in elevated NKT inflammatory response, while high Cell-IR cattle have increased CD8- γδ T cell and pro-inflammatory myeloid activity. Intercellular communication analysis using CellChat highlighted pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, particularly the IL-1β– IL-1R1 ligand-receptor interactions. This study provides a high-resolution atlas of Angus PBMCs and establishes a framework for linking immune cell composition with functional immune phenotypes in cattle.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is primarily known as a respiratory disease. The continued study of the disease has shown that long-term COVID-19 symptoms include persisting effects of the virus on the brain when the infection is over, possibly even leading to neurodegeneration. However, the exact mechanisms of nervous system damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear. In this study, we focused on two possibly shared pathways of SARS-CoV-2-induced neural dysfunction and neurodegeneration: protein aggregation, which is associated with impaired protein clearance, and inflammatory responses, which involve a hyper-active immune status. We observed distinct expression and distribution patterns of ten SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the two cell lines, meanwhile forming aggregation puncta and inducing pro-inflammatory responses. We found that the ER stress was induced and that the autophagy-lysosome pathway was inhibited upon viral protein expression. Boosting autophagy function attenuated protein aggregation, suggesting that modulation of autophagy might be a valid strategy for inhibiting cytotoxic effects of SARS-CoV- 2 proteins. Our study provides potential explanations of SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damage, based on shared cellular mechanisms and furthermore, suggests that modulation of proteostasis may serve as therapeutic strategies for preventing long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 cytotoxic effects.">

Despite its substantial global health impact, the biological mechanisms underlying PCC remain poorly understood, underscoring the need for validated animal models. Methods To address this, we conducted a longitudinal study using the golden Syrian hamster model, integrating virological, immunological, histopathological, and behavioral analyses from the acute phase to 60 days post-inoculation. Results Our results showed persistent viral RNA, prolonged immune dysregulation, and behavioral changes that mirrored key features of human PCC. Discussion Although fully reproducing PCC in animal models is inherently challenging due to its complex and heterogeneous presentation in humans, the use of complementary models with distinct phenotypes is essential for elucidating its pathophysiology. These results aim to contribute valuable insights into the biological basis of PCC and support the development of targeted preventative and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the worst pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Studies have shown that severe COVID-19 patients have immune dysfunction. To characterize the dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and scV(D)J-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from mild, moderate, and severe patients. We observed that as the severity of the disease increased, several CD8 + T cell subsets and Treg cells continued to decrease, while CD4 + T subsets, natural killer cells and plasma cells continued to increase. Several aberrantly expressed biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity were identified. For example, RPS26 was down-regulated, while the ZFP36, IL-32, and IgM genes were up-regulated with increasing disease severity. Functional analysis showed multiple immune-related pathways, such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-10 production pathways, were dysregulated. As the disease severity increased, intercellular interactions fluctuated. Particularly, naive CD8 + T cells regulated memory and activated CD8 + T cells, and the weakening in Treg cells’ regulation of other immune cells was especially obvious. The expression of the MIF signaling pathway, mediated by CD74 + CXCR4, was higher throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection and the intensity of immune cell-cell interactions mediated by TGF-β was enhanced from mild to severe. Subsequently, scV(D)J-seq analysis showed a decreasing trend in the number of clonotypes, repertoire diversity and clonotypes overlap of monoclonal B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) as the SARS-CoV-2 progresses. The CDR3 sequence length in COVID-19-specific clonotypes showed a bias towards being longer as the severity of COVID-19 increases. Our findings may provide new clues for understanding COVID-19 immunopathogenesis and help identify optimal biomarkers for new therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a neurological disease that primarily affects premature infants and involves infiltration of blood into the brain’s ventricles followed by excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to ventricular enlargement and increased intracranial pressure. The precise mechanisms driving PHH development and persistence are incompletely understood and lack disease-modifying treatments. Using a mouse model of PHH, we have identified transcriptomic, proteomic, and cellular features of PHH involving neuroimmune and neurovascular alterations recapitulating those reported in human disease. Improvement upon a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced PHH mouse model was combined with unbiased proteomic and single-nucleus transcriptomics that identified microglial molecular pathways propagating PHH. Pharmacological depletion of microglia in vivo significantly reduced PHH-associated ventriculomegaly. These data identify microglial and neurovascular elements in the development of PHH, implicating them as other potentially tractable therapeutic targets beyond LPA receptors, towards developing medical treatments for PHH.

        <tr id="Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder often preceded by gastrointestinal dysfunction. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are known risk factors for both PD and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting a link between PD and the gastrointestinal tract. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing and spectral flow cytometry, we demonstrated that the Lrrk2 Gly2019Ser (G2019S) mutation is associated with an increased neutrophil presence in the colonic lamina propria during Citrobacter rodentium infection. This concurred with a Th17 skewing, upregulated Il17a, and greater colonic pathology during infection. In vitro experiments showed enhanced kinase-dependent neutrophil chemotaxis and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in Lrrk2 G2019S mice compared to wild-type counterparts. Our results add to the understanding of LRRK2-driven immune cell dysregulation and its contribution to PD, offering insights into potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention in PD.">

        <tr id="Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a complex cascade of cellular and molecular responses, yet the complex cellular communication remains incompletely understood. This study explored how intercellular communication contributes to the activation of microglia and astrocytes after SCI. Here, we integrated four datasets using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and constructed a comprehensive cellular atlas of the injured spinal cord. Transcriptomic changes in microglia and astrocytes were analyzed. We identified CD44 as a key receptor in SPP1-mediated microglial activation, which represented a subpopulation involved in inflammatory response in microglia. We defined a gliogenesis subpopulation of astrocytes that emerged at 3 dpi, which became the predominant cell type in the injured spinal cord. These astrocytes highly expressed the Nucleolin (Ncl) gene and interacted via the Pleiotrophin (Ptn) signaling pathway, which is associated with astrocyte proliferation. To validate these findings, we utilized a crush injury model. Flow cytometry of isolated microglia and astrocytes confirmed the upregulation of CD44 in microglia and NCL in astrocytes in response to SCI. In vivo results confirmed that the CD44 positive microglia accumulated and PLA results further confirmed the combination of SPP1 with CD44. In parallel, the upregulated expression of NCL in astrocytes facilitated their proliferation, underscoring the role of the NCL receptor in gliogenesis after SCI. In vitro validation demonstrated that exogenous SPP1 upregulates CD44 expression by promoting the phosphorylation of p65 and activating the NF-κB pathways in BV2 microglia, and that high expression of IL-6 indicates the activation of inflammation. PTN may enhance NCL expression and thus facilitates astrocyte proliferation. Collectively, our study identified key receptors that regulated inflammation responses and gliogenesis. Targeting the CD44 and NCL receptors may provide promising therapeutic strategies to modulate inflammation and promote tissue repair after SCI.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major causes of severe lower respiratory tract infections, especially in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Complications arising from viral infections in these age groups can present therapeutic challenges, as most of these individuals have impaired adaptive immunity. Using the T‐ and B cell‐deficient Rag2−/− mice, the mechanisms that mediate protection in immunocompromised hosts during RSV infection can be investigated. RSV‐infected Rag2−/− mice showed no symptoms of disease or chronic inflammation in the lungs and airways despite the presence of infectious virus in their lungs several months after infection. Interestingly, Natural Killer (NK) cells, the main innate cells with anti‐viral cytotoxic effector functions, were recruited 2 days earlier in the lungs of Rag2−/− mice compared with wildtype mice, resulting in early production of IFN‐γ. However, depletion of NK cells did not affect disease severity or viral load. Together, these results suggest that the NK cells are largely dispensable for virus control during primary RSV infection in Rag2−/− mice.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is the major contributor to the pathology of neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (HI) brain injury. Our previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA210 (miR210) inhibition with antisense locked nucleic acid (LNA) inhibitor mitigates neuroinflammation and provides neuroprotection after neonatal HI insult. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, using miR210 knockout (KO) mice and microglial cultures, we tested the hypothesis that miR210 promotes microglial activation and neuroinflammation through suppressing mitochondrial function in microglia after HI. Neonatal HI brain injury was conducted on postnatal day 9 (P9) wild-type (WT) and miR210 knockout (KO) mouse pups. We found that miR210 KO significantly reduced brain infarct size at 48 h and improved long-term locomotor functions assessed by an open field test three weeks after HI. Moreover, miR210 KO mice exhibited reduced IL1β levels, microglia activation and immune cell infiltration after HI. In addition, in vitro studies of microglia exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) revealed that miR210 inhibition with LNA reduced OGD-induced expression of Il1b and rescued OGD-mediated downregulation of mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity. To validate the link between miR210 and microglia activation, isolated primary murine microglia were transfected with miR210 mimic or negative control. The results showed that miR210 mimic downregulated the expression of mitochondrial ISCU protein abundance and induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines similar to the effect observed with ISCU silencing RNA. In summary, our results suggest that miR210 is a key regulator of microglial proinflammatory activation through reprogramming mitochondrial function in neonatal HI brain injury.">

        <tr id="Hantaviruses are zoonotically transmitted from rodents to humans through the respiratory route, with no currently approved antivirals or widely available vaccines. The recent discovery of interhuman-transmitted Andes virus (ANDV) necessitates the systematic identification of cell tropism, infective potential, and potent therapeutic agents. We utilized human primary lung endothelial cells, various pluripotent stem cell-derived heart and brain cell types, and established human lung organoid models to evaluate the tropisms of Old World Hantaan (HTNV) and New World ANDV and Sin Nombre (SNV) viruses. ANDV exhibited broad tropism for all cell types assessed. SNV readily infected pulmonary endothelial cells, while HTNV robustly amplified in endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and astrocytes. We also provide the first evidence of hantaviral infection in human 3D distal lung organoids, which effectively modeled these differential tropisms. ANDV infection transcriptionally promoted cell injury and inflammatory responses, and downregulated lipid metabolic pathways in lung epithelial cells. Evaluation of selected drug candidates and pharmacotranscriptomics revealed that the host-directed small molecule compound urolithin B inhibited ANDV infection and restored cellular metabolism with minimal changes in host transcription. Given the scarcity of academic BSL-4 facilities that enable in vivo hantaviral studies, this investigation presents advanced human cell-based model systems that closely recapitulate host cell tropism and responses to infection, thereby providing critical platforms to evaluate potential antiviral drug candidates.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The markedly reduced pathogenicity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant in comparison to earlier strains has raised critical questions regarding its underlying mechanisms. To elucidate the host immune responses driving these differences, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of lung and blood samples from human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice infected with either the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain or the Omicron BA.1 variant at 5 days post-inoculation. Both strains induced a reduction in lung cell numbers, with capillary endothelial cells showing the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Shared transcriptional responses included upregulation of chemokine (e.g. Gnaq, Lyn, Ccl5) and IL-17 signaling pathways. Notably, Omicron BA.1 infection resulted in downregulation of Txnip, a key gene involved in oxidative stress responses. Genes associated with neutrophil granules and pro-inflammatory functions (Mmp8, S100a8, S100a9) were also downregulated, whereas wound healing pathways were upregulated in immature neutrophils. Additionally, Omicron BA.1 altered gene expression associated with neutrophil migration from blood to lung, and decreased the activation of cell chemotaxis, cytokine-mediated signaling, IL-17 and NF-κB pathways in pro-inflammatory monocytes and pulmonary interstitial macrophages. These findings highlight distinct immunological signatures contributing to the attenuated pathogenicity of Omicron BA.1, particularly through the modulation of neutrophil and monocyte-macrophage responses.">

However, we still lack mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating immunity induced by this platform, especially innate pathways. We utilized a human tonsil organoid model to study the regulation of adaptive responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-ɑ was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-ɑ-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-ɑ and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH. These data provide key insights into innate pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced immunity and highlights the promise of this model for vaccine platform mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Background Although COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory tract, liver injury has been increasingly reported in infected individuals. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces hepatocyte damage remain poorly understood. Given the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and regulated cell death in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatocytes using the Huh7.5 cell model. Methods Huh7.5 hepatocytes were infected with either the ancestral Wuhan (Wh) or Omicron (BA.5) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Viral replication was quantified via RT-qPCR, nucleocapsid protein detection, and infectious particle titration. Mitochondrial function was assessed through mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), mROS production, and mitophagy analysis. Lipid metabolism and regulated cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis) were evaluated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The role of specific cell death pathways was probed using chemical inhibitors. Results Both SARS-CoV-2 variants efficiently infected Huh7.5 cells, with distinct replication kinetics. Infection induced mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated mROS levels, and lipid droplet accumulation. Ferroptosis was identified as a predominant mode of cell death, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and the protective effect of ferrostatin-1. Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a ferroptosis marker and alternative viral entry receptor, was significantly upregulated post-infection in a variant-dependent manner. Additionally, mROS scavenging with MitoTEMPO impaired viral replication, underscoring the role of oxidative stress in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, promoting ferroptosis as a major contributor to virus-induced cytopathology. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may play a central role in COVID-19-related liver injury and identify mitochondrial ROS and iron metabolism as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="To better understand the molecular mechanism that drives neuroinflammation, we analyzed the protein profiles of 27 brains from HIV with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART), including various stages of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and compared them to 9 HAND-negative controls. We found that most of the proteins that were increased—about 66.7%—were involved in immune response pathways. Of these, 23.3% were specifically related to type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, which remains active in the brain through both HIV-related and unrelated mechanisms. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on brain tissues collected during rapid autopsies from participants in the Last Gift cohort, we found that IFN-I signaling was especially strong in astrocytes, microglia (MG), and endothelial cells. In a mini-brain organoid model of acute HIV infection, IFN-I signaling was also highly active in astrocytes but less so in MG. Interestingly, IFN-I activation can happen without HIV being present—expression of human endogenous retrovirus-W1 (HERV-W1) Env can directly trigger this response in astrocytes, and it continues in glial cells even with effective ART. Together, our findings point to persistent IFN-I activation in glial and endothelial cells in the brain, which may contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive disorders in PWH on ART.">

Peripheral monocytes are crucial components of the human immune system, but their contribution to AD pathogenesis is still largely understudied partially due to limited human models. Here, we introduce human cortical organoid microphysiological systems (hCO-MPSs) to study AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. By culturing doughnut-shape organoids on 3D-printed devices within standard 96-well plates, we generate hCO-MPSs with reduced necrosis, minimized hypoxia, and improved viability. Using these models, we found that monocytes from AD patients exhibit increased infiltration ability, decreased amyloid-β clearance capacity, and stronger inflammatory response than monocytes from age-matched control donors. Moreover, we observed that AD monocytes induce pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the marked increase in IL1B and CCL3 expression underscores their pivotal role in AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. Our findings provide insight into understanding monocytes’ role in AD pathogenesis, and our lab-compatible MPS models may offer a promising way for studying various neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system can develop a form of memory called priming, where prior exposure to a stimulus enhances subsequent responses. While well-characterized in peripheral immunity, its function in brain-resident cells such as astrocytes under non-disease conditions remains unclear. Here we show that human astrocytes derived from the induced pluripotent stem cells of healthy female donors, but not microglia, acquire a primed state following transient immune stimulations. Upon subsequent exposure to amyloid-β (Aβ), these astrocytes secrete elevated levels of cytokines and promote microglial Aβ uptake. In contrast, astrocytes carrying the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk allele APOE4 exhibit reduced priming and fail to support microglial phagocytosis. These findings are validated in astrocyte-microglial co-cultures, cerebral organoids, and male mice, where astrocyte priming enhances Aβ clearance in an APOE4-sensitive manner. Our findings identify astrocytic immune memory as a modulator of microglial function and Aβ pathology, providing insights into how early protective responses in AD may be disrupted by genetic risk factors.">

        <tr id="African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an important transboundary animal pathogen with significant impacts on the global swine industry. Overwhelming proinflammatory responses are a major virulence mechanism for ASFV, but the dynamics of these changes during clinical disease are not completely understood. We constructed a detailed portrait of the innate immune responses during acute African swine fever (ASF) at the cellular, transcriptomic, and cytokine levels. Samples serially obtained from infected piglets show progression of acute ASF is characterized by rapid increases in plasma type I interferons, TNF-α, IL-12p40, and IL-10, which coincide with the manifestation of clinical disease and viral DNAemia. Lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells progressively declined, with fluctuations in B cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell populations. Blood monocytes and macrophages were highly variable throughout infection, with an abrupt spike in CD203+ mature macrophages immediately prior to death. Transcriptomic analysis of blood showed downregulation of cellular translation as early as 1 day post challenge (DPC), and significant upregulation of antiviral immune processes at 5 DPC and 7 DPC which overlapped with the onset of clinical disease. Together, these results present a highly detailed delineation of fatal ASF as involving an initial infection and damage of susceptible myeloid cells prior to symptomatic disease characterized by pro-inflammatory immune responses, lymphoid depletion, and clinical deterioration.">

        <tr id="Children with COVID-19 typically experience milder symptoms and lower hospitalization rates, though severe cases do occur. Understanding age-related immune responses is crucial for future preparedness. We characterized immune response dynamics to SARS-CoV-2 in 145 samples from 119 pediatric patients (<18 years) with confirmed infection, assessed at four distinct time points: <14 days, 14 days–3 months, 3–6 months, and 6–12 months post-infection. At infection, patients presented increased activated T-cells, higher levels of exhaustion (i.e., PD-1+), lower numbers of unswitched memory B-cells, and increased antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Both humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses increased over time (all patients showed measurable responses in the last assessment). Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients (58.6%) showed increased specific cellular responses from infection onwards, along with enriched memory B-cell subsets (but not ASCs), and distinct T-cell activation profiles. Children with severe disease were younger, predominantly boys, displayed altered T/B-cell ratios, and reduced PHA responses when infected. Compared to adolescents, younger children showed lower antibody titers and weaker cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2, possibly underlining the higher prevalence of severe manifestations in younger children. Our study illustrates important age-, gender-, and disease severity-dependent variations in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which can be helpful in improving patient management and immunization strategies adjusted to age groups.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV-infected and bystander-activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV-infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing. IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and functional genomics to understand the host response in both RSV-infected and bystander cells, identify what host factors mediate infection, and contextualize these findings relative to dozens of previously reported screens across 17 additional viruses.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately affected individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, such as neurocognitive disorders. Premorbid neurocognitive conditions compounded by COVID-19 can escalate into COVID-associated neurological complications, leading to severe illness or even death. As COVID-19 continues to persist and vaccines lose efficacy against emerging variants, individuals with neurocognitive disorders often experience prolonged symptoms that are further exacerbated by repeated breakthrough infections of highly diversified viral variants due to emergence of new viral mutations. Despite the significance of neurocognitive disorders as risk factors for COVID-19-related mortality and long COVID, the underlying causes remain largely unknown. In this study, we report a link between ORF3a expression and COVID-associated neuroinflammation and neurocytotoxicity in postmortem brain tissues from COVID-19 patients. These findings were further verified through neural cell-based in vitro and in vivo animal studies introducing ORF3a either alone or in the context of viral infection. As a membrane-associated protein, ORF3a induces upregulation of Sur1-regulated ion channels, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ influx, apoptosis, and necrosis through both NF-kB-dependent and independent proinflammatory responses in astrocytes. These findings reveal a novel clinical and mechanistic link between ORF3a and Sur1-regulated ion channels, which are highly responsive to neuroinflammatory conditions causing neurodegeneration. Additionally, we have identified a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, glibenclamide, and a natural antiviral compound glycyrrhizin that effectively mitigates the neuropathological effects of ORF3a, underscoring the therapeutic potential and clinical significance of these findings. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects individuals with pre-existing neurocognitive conditions primarily due to COVID-19-associated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity (CNN), which can progress to COVID-associated neurological disorders (CANDs), leading to severe illness and mortality. Despite CNN’s significant contribution to CANDs and related morbidity and mortality, its underlying causes remain poorly understood. Our study identifies ORF3a as a key driver of CNN, establishing a direct clinical and functional link between ORF3a and CNN linking to CANDs. Mechanistically, ORF3a disrupts ion homeostasis in astrocytes by promoting Ca²+ influx through Sur1-regulated ion channels, contributing to CNN. Notably, the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug glibenclamide, a Sur1-specific inhibitor, and the natural compound glycyrrhizin effectively mitigate ORF3a-induced neuropathology, highlighting ORF3a as a promising therapeutic target. These findings present a potential strategy to eliminate CNN and prevent CANDs.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic, significantly impacting social and economic aspects of society. While belonging to the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 exhibited unique characteristics that facilitated its widespread transmission and pathogenicity. This study aimed to investigate the molecular characterization and infection kinetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence. We isolated 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants from clinical samples and conducted in vitro studies using Calu-3 cell lines and pseudovirus systems to explore viral entry. Whole-genome sequencing identified mutations linked to increased replication and enhanced immune evasion, particularly through the inhibition of interferon responses. Additionally, persistence studies on common environmental surfaces (copper, aluminum, and plastic) revealed that certain variants, such as G446S, contributed to increased viral stability, suggesting potential for indirect transmission beyond direct person-to-person contact. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of “green” disinfectants, including tea tree oil and quercetin-based compounds, which demonstrated viral load reductions of over 95% within minutes, outperforming conventional alcohol- and UV-based disinfection methods. Notably, two influenza virus isolates belonging to highly divergent subtypes are sanitized as well while showing different persistence surface profiles compared to SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight the evolutionary strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 to ensure transmission, its ability to adapt under selective pressure, and the importance of ongoing surveillance of emerging variants. Moreover, the efficacy of environmentally sustainable disinfectants presents a promising strategy for reducing viral transmission in both clinical and community settings. IMPORTANCE In this study, we evaluated the molecular profile of 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence. Through whole-genome sequencing, we identified mutations linked to enhanced replication and immune evasion, notably through the suppression of interferon responses. Additionally, persistence studies on common environmental surfaces (copper, aluminum, and plastic) demonstrated that certain mutations, such as G446S, exhibited increased stability, suggesting a potential role for indirect transmission. This study underscores the need for continuous monitoring and the potential of eco-friendly disinfection approaches in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and possibly of other respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) is recognized as a critical pathological process in meningitic Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection, leading to severe neurodegenerative disorders and long-term sequelae. Astrocyte reactivity plays a pivotal role in driving the neuroinflammatory cascade in response to pathological stimuli from peripheral sources or other cellular components of the CNS. The involvement of astrocyte reactivity in the inflammatory process induced by bacterial infection within the CNS warrants further investigation. In this study, we observed an astrocyte reaction likely mediated by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) during meningitic E. coli infection in both a mouse model and a BMEC-astrocyte coculture system. Through label-free quantitative proteomics analysis of the BMEC secretome, we identified CK2 as a potential trigger for astrocyte reactivity. Inhibition of CK2 attenuated the reaction of hippocampal astrocytes in E. coli meningitis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CK2 enhances NF-κB activation via its interaction with myosin 9, thereby increasing astrocyte reactivity and the inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. By conditionally knocking out CK2β in microvessel, we blocked CK2 secretion, resulting in reduced astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation during the early stages of infection. Compared to wild-type mice, CK2βVas-/- mice exhibited a significantly higher survival rate. Collectively, our findings highlight the essential role of endothelial-glial communication mediated by CK2 interaction with myosin 9 in activating the downstream NF-κB pathway, contributing to astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation. These results provide novel insights into the treatment of CNS inflammation caused by bacterial blood-borne infections.">

        <tr id="Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect substantial populations worldwide and increase the risk of developing cognitive impairments and alcohol-associated dementia. While chronic inflammatory signaling likely plays an important role in alcohol-associated neurological sequalae, the precise mechanisms underlying alcohol-associated neuropathology remain enigmatic. We hypothesize that alcohol leads to neuroimmune dysregulation among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia; and is perpetuated by innate immune signaling pathways involving cell-cell signaling. To investigate how alcohol dysregulates neuroimmune interactions in a human context, we constructed a triculture model comprising neurons, astrocytes, and microglia derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. After exposure to ethanol, we observed significant differential gene expression relating to innate immune pathways, inflammation, and microglial activation. Microglial activation was confirmed with morphological analysis and expression of CD68, a lysosomal-associated membrane protein and marker for phagocytic microglial activation. A striking finding in our study was the elevation of TREM2 expression and, specifically, TREM2 alternative splice variants that are predicted to give rise to soluble TREM2. TREM2 has been reported to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. These results suggest that ethanol exposure in the brain may lead to increased microglial activation and production of soluble isoform named TREM2219 through alternate splicing. Deciphering the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning ethanol-related neuroimmune dysregulation within a human context promises to shed light on the etiology of AUD-related disorders, potentially contributing to the development of effective therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a hallmark of neovascular age‐related macular degeneration, a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the elderly. While immune dysregulation and myeloid cell activation have been implicated in CNV pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms by which myeloid subsets influence NV remain incompletely understood. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an immunomodulatory receptor enriched in microglia and tissue macrophages, known to play protective roles in retinal and neurodegenerative diseases. However, its function in CNV has not been fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the role of TREM2 in CNV using transcriptomic, genetic, and functional approaches. Single‐cell RNA sequencing revealed selective upregulation of Trem2 in activated microglia and macrophages following laser‐induced CNV. These findings were validated at the protein level using immunostaining, which confirmed robust TREM2 expression in lesion‐associated IBA1+ myeloid cells. Functionally, Trem2 haploinsufficiency exacerbated CNV lesion size and vascular leakage, indicating a protective role in disease modulation. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that Trem2‐expressing myeloid cells exhibit distinct angiogenic and inflammasome‐related gene signatures, suggesting that TREM2 regulates angiogenesis through modulation of inflammatory pathways. We further examined the functional interaction between TREM2 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), another anti‐inflammatory mediator upregulated during CNV. Using compound mutant mice, we showed that Trem2 and SOCS3 function through overlapping but independent anti‐angiogenic programs, and their combined deficiency leads to additive worsening of CNV pathology. These findings establish TREM2 as a key regulator of myeloid cell function and angiogenesis in the diseased retina.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a severe neurological condition associated with high rates of mortality or long‐term disability. Despite its clinical significance, the detailed cellular mechanisms underlying HIE remain unclear. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity across development, aging, and disease processes. However, no scRNA‐seq studies have yet addressed neonatal HIE. In this study, we employed scRNA‐seq to examine cellular heterogeneity during neonatal HIE. We analyzed a total of 87 580 high‐quality brain cells to identify transcriptional changes associated with HIE. In the hyperacute phase, we observed astrocytes in response to tumor necrosis factors, involvement of microglia in phagocytosis, Stat3‐mediated ischemic responses in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and an increase in senescent lymphatic endothelial cells. In the acute phase, astrocytes were activated and involved in gliogenesis, while microglia proliferated. Neuroblasts were affected by metal ions, and oligodendrocytes decreased. In the subacute phase, astrocytes involved in inflammation and antigen presentation, while inflammatory microglia highly expressing MHC II were induced by the IL27 and type I interferon pathways and expanded. Additionally, peripheral immune cells played vital roles in HIE. Specifically, neutrophils infiltrated and expanded throughout all phases post‐HIE. Spp1 high macrophages, T cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells increased during the acute and subacute phases, and B cells expanded during the subacute phase. This study offers deep insights into the molecular alterations of key cell types following HIE, elucidating the pathological processes involved. These findings have significant implications for developing effective clinical strategies for managing HIE.">

        <tr id="RhoA, a small GTPase, plays a pivotal role in various diseases, including spinal cord injury (SCI). Although RhoA inhibition has been traditionally viewed as beneficial for SCI repair, recent clinical trials of RhoA inhibitors in SCI have failed to show significant therapeutic efficacy, suggesting functional heterogeneity across different cell types. The role of RhoA in microglia, the key immune cells involve in SCI, remains poorly understood. Using microglial RhoA conditional knockout mice, this study demonstrated that RhoA deficiency in microglia attenuates the morphological and functional repair of the SCI mice, and impairs the microglial biofunctions of proliferation, phagocytosis, and migration. Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and metabolomics revealed that RhoA deficiency can attenuate the microglial glycolytic enzyme expression, ATP production, ECAR and OCR levels through the Arhgap25/HIF-1α pathway.

        <tr id="A Cytokine storm is critical in severe dengue, significantly contributing to disrupted endothelial integrity, plasma leakage, and haemorrhage manifestations in affected patients. Various reports have demonstrated that mononuclear phagocytes, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, are target cells of DENV infection. They contribute to viral spread into tissues and promote robust inflammatory responses and immunopathology. However, it remains unclear whether the early events of DENV infection play a role in triggering cytokine storms in infected mononuclear phagocytes. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profile of in vitro DENV-2-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) based on the kinetics of viral replication through a standard growth curve. To verify the accuracy of our approach, we used RT-qPCR, ELISA, and transcriptomic data from in vitro DENV-2-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and monocytes obtained from acute dengue patients. RNA-Seq analysis revealed dynamic changes in the transcriptional profile of DENV-2-infected MDMs throughout the viral growth curve. Two waves of differentially expressed genes were observed: the first occurred during the eclipse period of viral replication (3 to 5.5 h.p.i) and was associated with the induction of NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory factors, while the second wave at 24 h.p.i coincided with peaks of DENV-2 replication and induction of both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, DENV-2 infection promoted the dynamic activation of Toll-like receptors, RIG-like receptors, inflammasomes, and inflammatory pathways, triggering innate pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses. A robust multi-type IFN-dependent antiviral response was also observed at the late stage of infection. A similar transcriptomic profile was found in DENV-2-infected MDDCs and monocyte subsets from acute dengue patients, further confirming the reliability of our in vitro model of DENV-infected MDMs. Together, results suggest that recognizing viral PAMPs during the eclipse period of DENV-2 infection promotes a robust NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in MDMs. In addition, at later stages of infection, recognizing structural DENV-PAMPs and/or viral replication intermediates induces both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses, leading to a cytokine storm. These findings highlight the critical role of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in detecting DENV infection and triggering a cytokine storm in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that these cell populations could be potential targets for future immunotherapies to modulate the inflammatory response to DENV infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunity response following vaccination and infection toward the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant remains limited in chronic liver disease (CLD) population. This study aims to investigate humoral and cell-mediate immunity to Omicron BA.4/5 among CLD patients with/without breakthrough infections (BI). This longitudinal study characterized immune responses to Omicron infection across three CLD patient groups: vaccinated without BI (group 1, n = 10), vaccinated with BI (group 2, n = 43), and unvaccinated infected (group 3, n = 7). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies/T-cell responses and lymphocyte phenotypes were quantified by ELISA and flow cytometry. Logistic regression identified immunological correlates of BI event, viral clearance and liver disease progression. Dynamic immunity changes after infection analyzed using Spearman’s correlation. Patients in group 2 exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.4.5, anti-RBD IgG, and total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to groups 1 and 3. Comparable T cell responses were observed between two vaccinated groups, stronger than unvaccinated individuals. Hybrid immune (vaccination plus infection) elicited stronger NAbs-WT, total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, anti-RBD IgG, MBCs, and Omicron-specific IFN-γ+/IL-4+CD4+T cells compared to primary Omicron infection. Besides, severe liver disease was not only a risk factor for BI, but also impaired Omicron-specific IFN-γ+CD8+T, CD38+CD4+T, and CD45RA+CD8+T cells responses after infection. Importantly, IgG+/IgM+MBCs and NAbs showed positive associations with central memory (CD45RA−CD62L+CD4/8) or naive (CD45RA+CD62L+CD4) T cells. Low levels of CD45RA+CD62L+CD8+T cells and resting MBCs were identified as the independent risk factors for viral clearance and disease progression, respectively. BI predominantly stimulates humoral immunity without enhancing cellular responses. Weaker immune response induced by primary Omicron infection underscores the need for additional vaccinations in vaccine-naïve CLD patients. The positive correlations between humoral/cellular immunity and memory/activated T cells reveal their coordinated role in adaptive immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. These findings emphasize the importance of regular immune monitoring and timely interventions to optimize protection for CLD patients against emerging Omicron subvariants.">

        <tr id="Introduction An unbalanced immune response and excessive inflammation are the major hallmarks of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in multiorgan failure and death. The dysregulation of the complement system has been shown in various studies as a crucial factor in the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Complement alternative pathway has been linked to the excessive inflammation in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in which decreased levels of factor H (FH) and elevated levels of properdin (FP) were observed. The current study investigated the potential immune protective roles of FP and FH against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods The interactions between FH and FP and the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and its receptor binding domain (RBD) were evaluated using direct ELISA. The cell binding and luciferase-based viral entry assays utilising S protein expressing lentiviral pseudotypes were used to evaluate the possible modulatory effects of FH, FP, and recombinant thrombospondin repeats 4 and 5 (TSR4 + 5) on SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Using RT-qPCR, we also assessed the immunomodulatory roles of FH and FP in the cytokine response induced by SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes. Results FH and FP were found to bind to both the RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. The treatment of FP or TSR4 + 5 enhanced cell binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes that was administered in A549 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells). FP increases the affinity between host ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2, according to in silico work. In A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells, the effect of FP on viral cell entry and binding was counteracted by anti-FP antibody treatment. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudotypes’ cell entry and binding were decreased by FH treatment. The A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 alphaviral pseudotypes (expressing spike, envelope, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins) pre-treated with FP or TSR4+5 showed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts, including NF-κB and IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-α, and RANTES. Contrary to this, the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines was downregulated by FH treatment. FH treatment decreased S protein-mediated NF-κB activation, but FP treatment enhanced it in A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells. Discussion These results imply that FH may function as a SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and binding inhibitor, reducing the inflammatory response linked to infection independently of complement activation. FP could aid cell viral entry and binding and aggravate hyperinflammation that might contribute to the severity of the infection.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with cytotoxic activity against tumors and viruses. The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased the investigation of their role in disease severity. However, their functional status and modulators remain controversial. Recent studies highlighted the role of metabolism in immune function, but metabolic changes in NK cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unexplored. This study compares metabolic (SIRT1, AMPKA, HIF1A, and GLUT1) and inflammatory (NFKB1, NFKB1A, IFNG, and SOCS1) gene expression, and flow cytometry-based assessment of functional markers in NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients (n=15) and the control group (n=10), and their association with clinical outcomes. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated IFNγ, Granzyme B, and KIR2DL1 expression in NK cells compared to controls (P < 0.005), while LAMP1 was unchanged (P > 0.05). NK cells from deceased patients exhibited significantly lower expression levels of LAMP1 and Granzyme B (P < 0.05). Patients hospitalized >7 days presented lower Granzyme-B+ NK cells (P < 0.05). NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients showed downregulation of HIF1A and GLUT1, and upregulation of NFKB1 (P < 0.05). HIF1A and GLUT1 expression were elevated in patients with >7 days of hospitalization (P < 0.05). SIRT1 expression was higher in patients requiring intubation (P < 0.05). SIRT1, HIF1A, and GLUT1 were upregulated in deceased patients (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrate that NK cells from patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit increased functional markers and dysregulated metabolic gene expression associated with clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Circulating platelets are increasingly recognized for their critical involvement in thromboinflammatory complications during respiratory infections, underscoring the importance of comprehending their dual role in immunomodulation and hemostasis. The multifaceted roles of platelets are attributed to their inherent heterogeneity, where the molecular diversity enables their functional versatility. However, research remains deficient in dissecting platelet heterogeneity within respiratory infection contexts, capturing the platelet subpopulations exhibiting specialized functional roles, and elucidating the therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab. Methods Leveraging the adequate platelet population detected through single-cell RNA sequencing, this study established stratified study cohorts central to: (1) COVID-19 disease severity, (2) therapeutic responsiveness, and (3) non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. An integrative annotation framework was implemented in this study, which encompassed co-expressed gene module identification, cell-cell communication network mapping, and cell trajectory assessment, to hierarchically dissect the functional dynamics of platelet heterogeneity in disease pathologies and their modulation by therapeutic interventions. Results This study unfolds six severity-associated platelet subpopulations, explores their modulation by corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments, and extends the findings to non-COVID-19 severe conditions. In severe COVID-19, platelet subpopulations with elevated innate immune responsiveness and high coagulation potential are intensively enriched, whereas following dexamethasone administration, this pro-coagulable subpopulation is remarkably repressed. Post-tocilizumab treatment, the instructive interaction from platelets to IFN-activated CD8+ T cells is reduced, while communications from memory B cells, CD4+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to platelets are enhanced. A platelet trajectory, which participates in neutrophil chemotaxis and B cell-mediated humoral responses, emerges specifically in COVID-19 conditions and is absent in non-COVID-19. Conclusions A systematic investigation of platelet transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory infections, combined with the delineation of its therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab, advances the understanding of platelet involvement in immune-thrombotic dysregulation and provides a foundation for exploring potential therapeutic targets.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the transcriptional profiles of immune cells from hematoma samples derived from ICH patients, which was rarely focused before. Methods Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on hematoma and blood samples derived from ICH patients, with blood samples from healthy volunteers serving as a control. Subsequent comprehensive analyses, including cell–cell communication and trajectory inference, were conducted to provide a detailed understanding of immune cell characteristics in ICH. Results Hematoma and blood samples were derived from four ICH patients, with blood samples from three healthy volunteers as control. At the single-cell level, three major immune cell types were identified, with neutrophils playing a predominant role. Subtypes of these immune cells were further characterized based on their profiles in hematoma and blood samples. The role of Toll-like receptor 4 in hematoma in ICH was further investigated from the perspective of immune inflammation and metabolism. Conclusion This study offers a comprehensive overview of the immune cell landscape in ICH, derived from hematoma and blood samples, which has been rarely reported. The dynamic inflammatory processes involving distinct immune cell types were further elucidated, and provides potential therapeutic targets for future interventions.

        <tr id="Background Boosting myelin repair is widely recognized as one of the most powerful approaches for demyelinating therapy, essentially contributing to the recovery of neurological functions. Maintaining immune homeostasis in microglia is a prerequisite for creating a reparative environment for myelin. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is clinically effective in reshaping immunological status and implies potential in treating demyelinating disease. However, its relevance to pro-remyelination remains unclear. Methods We first evaluated the effects of DHA on neurofunctional recovery and white matter integrity in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an ideal model for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) characterized by remyelination deficiency. Single-cell sequencing and microglial depletion with PLX3397 in vivo were used to reveal the dependency between DHA and microglia. The effect of DHA on the reparative phenotype of microglia, particularly on cholesterol recycling and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), was evaluated in microglia-OPCs unit either in vitro or in vivo challenged with myelin debris. Finally, to broaden the clinical application for DHA in myelin repair, it was tested in the cuprizone (CPZ) model which shows remyelination failure, a condition common in various neurodegenerative diseases. Results We demonstrated for the first time that DHA enhanced white matter integrity and OPCs proliferation and differentiation. This effect is dependent on the transition of microglia to a reparative phenotype. Specifically, DHA increased the secretion of inflammatory-resolving and neurotrophic cytokines. It further functionalized cholesterol recycling and provided metabolic support for myelin regeneration predominantly mediated by liver X receptor (LXR) in microglia. This was evidenced by the promotion of myelin debris uptake, cholesterol catabolism, efflux and transport. Notably, DHA promoted remyelination and neurological functional recovery in CPZ-induced demyelinating model, supporting its potential application in neurodegenerative diseases featuring insufficient remyelination. Conclusion By highlighting the importance of microglia in promoting myelin regeneration, our study proved DHA as a promising candidate for promoting remyelination. Graphical Abstract A schematic diagram illustrates that DHA enhances remyelination by inducing a reparative phenotype of microglia mainly through its function in cholesterol recycling, thereby creating a permissive immune environment for OPCs proliferation and differentiation.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a health risk for humans and other domestic and wildlife species. Recently, North American elk have been identified as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a potential threat to humans and other mammals. In this work, we characterized the peripheral transcriptomic response to experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in calves and adult elk at different time points. Results Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified at 2-, 5-, and 14-days post inoculation (pi) for both age groups. Adult elk presented the greatest number of differentially expressed (DE) genes at all time points, including many genes associated with viral response, immune activation, antibody production, as well as genes associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and coronavirus GO terms and KEGG pathways. Calves presented DE genes associated with viral responses at 5 days pi as well as neurodegenerative-associated genes at 14 days pi. Both adults and calves showed predicted activation of the ISGF3 and IFN type I pathways at day 2 pi and, globally, increased activity related to the coronavirus pathway disease at 5 and 14 days pi. Conclusions Collectively, this work provides valuable data characterizing the cervid immune response of elk to viral diseases as well as the response of wildlife to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <tr id="Background Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but severe complication that arises between two and six weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanisms underlying why only a subset of children develop this hyperinflammatory response remain unclear. Methods We performed an in-depth proteomic analysis of plasma samples from children before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those who developed MIS-C. Proteomic profiling was conducted using high-throughput technologies, and findings were validated using publicly available datasets. Results Healthy children showed minimal changes in the circulating proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of ongoing inflammation. In contrast, children with MIS-C exhibited significant activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and elevated circulating markers of myocardial and vascular injury. Conclusions Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection alone does not cause sustained proteomic alterations in most children. However, MIS-C is associated with a distinct inflammatory and vascular injury signature. Several candidate diagnostic biomarkers for MIS-C were identified and validated in silico, offering promising avenues for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="As an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits remarkable contagiousness and has emerged as a critical global public health concern. In critically ill patients, virus-induced cytokine storms and resulting multi-organ failure represent significant therapeutic challenges. In our clinical observations, we identified that this hyperinflammatory state was correlated with reduced mRNA expression of both Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-Induced Protein 8-like Protein 2 (TIPE2)—an immune negative modulator—and the ferroptosis marker gene Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of these patients. Given the emerging evidence that macrophage polarization and dysfunction play pivotal roles in COVID-19 progression, we established a THP-1-derived macrophage model stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to mimic the host immune response. Our results demonstrated that TIPE2 modulates S protein-induced macrophage polarization and ferroptosis, specifically by suppressing M1 polarization associated with inflammation and encouraging M2 polarization linked to anti-inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that TIPE2 mediates critical immunomodulatory effects during the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating pathological inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients gravely affected.

This highlights the need to study the humoral immune response to better understand the pathophysiology of viral respiratory infections and improve treatments and diagnostics. This study analyzed autoantibody and acute-phase reactant profiles in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A using customized protein microarrays for sensitive and reproducible results. The findings revealed a significant increase in autoantibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients, including those targeting calcitonin-related polypeptides, hepatocyte growth factor, or interleukin 8, compared to Influenza A patients, who showed elevated levels of selectin E and surfactant protein D. Additionally, most acute-phase reactants were higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The serological profile showed that the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain induced both IgM and IgG responses to all viral proteins, while other strains triggered an IgG response only at a later stage. Multiomics factor analysis identified key factors driving variation in COVID-19's heterogeneous disease presentation.

        <tr id="Background In sepsis, oxidative stress (OS) triggers essential adaptive responses and emerging OS-related biomarkers show potential for enhancing sepsis diagnosis and therapy. Methodology In this study, we used single-cell datasets and the OS gene set to identify immune cell types with the highest oxidative activity across different sepsis states. Differential expression genes (DEG) between “high state” cells and “low state” cells were screened. High-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA), combined with multiple machine learning methods, was used for the selection of hub genes. Expressions of hub genes were then validated. Cell–cell communication and transcription factor analysis were performed later. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting validated expression of LILRA5 in both the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model and the lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis model. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were also detected in THP-1 cells after silencing LILRA5. Results In the early stages of sepsis, oxidative activity reaches its peak, with macrophages displaying the highest OS among all cell types. Through the application of the “Quartile method”, all cells were clustered into three states based on OS activity (low, medium, and high). LILRA5, MGST1, PLBD1, and S100A9 were selected as hub genes and significantly upregulated in sepsis. LILRA5 was predominantly expressed in macrophages and was highly expressed in the early stage of macrophage. Specifically, LILRA5+ macrophages exhibit the strongest OS. LILRA5 showed a higher expression in both mouse sepsis models and the THP-1 cell after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Silencing LILRA5 resulted in a significant reduction of ROS in THP-1 cells. Conclusion In conclusion, our study has mapped the landscape of OS dynamics in sepsis and found that LILRA5+ macrophages in the early stage of sepsis exhibit the highest OS. LILRA5 emerges as a promising gene for modulating macrophage-mediated OS in sepsis.">

        <tr id="Traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits a sustained innate immune response involving both resident microglia and infiltrating peripheral immune cells. However, the influence of peripheral immune-derived signals on microglial dynamics and functional recovery remains poorly understood. We previously identified the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA4 as a regulator of acute neuroinflammation following TBI. In this study, we employed bone marrow chimeric mice with hematopoietic-specific EphA4 knockout and subjected them to controlled cortical impact (CCI) to investigate the role of EphA4 in modulating acute and chronic microglial responses. Mice lacking EphA4 in hematopoietic cells exhibited reduced microglial apoptosis and proliferation at 3 days post-injury (dpi), accompanied by increased microglial sphericity at 3- and 60-days post-injury (dpi) within the injured cortex. These morphological changes coincided with enhanced spatial proximity to peripheral-derived macrophages. Behaviorally, EphA4-deficient chimeric mice demonstrated improved performance in the novel object recognition test at 3 dpi, and in the T-maze at both 60 and 90 dpi. Single-cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal tissue at 90 dpi revealed microglial subpopulations uniquely enriched in EphA4-deficient chimeric mice, with transcriptional profiles associated with leukocyte differentiation, immune regulation, hematopoiesis, and endothelial development. Together, these findings demonstrate that peripheral immune-derived EphA4 signaling influences microglial heterogeneity and negatively regulates long-term neuroimmune remodeling and functional recovery following TBI.">

        <tr id="Abstract Aging is associated with elevated levels of inflammation across tissues, a status recognized as “inflammaging.” Within the brain, microglia are the resident phagocytic immune cells that are important in both homeostatic and disease states. Aged microglia are susceptible to processes of “inflammaging,” which can include higher expression of baseline levels of inflammatory signals, decline in functional activity, and contribution to neurodegenerative processes. Information about microglial function has been gained using in vitro cell culture methods; however, most studies described previously have used microglia cultured from neonatal mice. More recent studies have used microglia cultured from young adult mice, but those using microglia from aged mice are lacking. Considering the distinct changes that come with aging and the important role of microglia in age‐related neurologic disorders, there is a need for reliable protocols for studying aged cells specifically. Here, we describe a method to culture primary microglia from aged mice. Collected brain tissue is digested using enzymatic and mechanical techniques and then cultured in specific medium that supports the continued survival and proliferation of adult and aged microglia. To confirm microglial identity, cultured cells were immunostained for microglia‐specific markers and imaged by microscopy and flow cytometry. We also compared the activation status of adult and aged microglia that were cultured versus those that were assessed directly after collection. Microglial cultures can easily be manipulated via genetic modifications or pharmacologic intervention to test specific functions. © 2025 The Author(s).

        <tr id="Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) represents a severe complication of cranial radiotherapy, substantially diminishing patients’ quality of life. Unlike conventional brain injuries, RIBI evokes a unique chronic neuroinflammatory response that notably aggravates neurodegenerative processes. Despite significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms related to neuroinflammation, the specific and precise mechanisms that regulate neuroinflammation in RIBI and its associated toxicological effects remain largely unclear. Additionally, targeted neuroprotective strategies for RIBI are currently lacking. In this study, we systematically characterized the pathophysiology of RIBI using zebrafish (larvae/adults) and murine models. We established direct associations between neuronal damage and cognitive-behavioral deficits. Mechanistically, we proposed a ROS-mitochondrial-immune axis. Specifically, radiation-induced ROS lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in the leakage of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol. This, in turn, activated the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby driving persistent microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we engineered a dual-function nanotherapeutic agent, Pep-Cu5.4O@H151. This agent integrates ultrasmall copper-based nanozymes (Cu5.4O) for ROS scavenging and H151 (a STING inhibitor) and is conjugated with peptides that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and target microglia. This nanoplatform exhibited excellent synergistic therapeutic efficacy by simultaneously neutralizing oxidative stress and blocking inflammatory cascades. Our research provided an in-depth analysis of radiation-induced neurotoxicity, clarifying the crucial ROS-mitochondrial-immune axis. Moreover, we have developed a precise therapeutic strategy on the basis of this mechanism.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2029 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which enters the human body via the respiratory route and can infect nasal and bronchial epithelial cells, goblet cells, hair cells, pneumocytes, etc. COVID-19 caused the worst pandemic in centuries. SARS-CoV-2, once in the airway tree, penetrates the host cells and causes a strong inflammatory reaction by a rapid response of the innate immune system, in particular by activation of macrophages and dendritic cells that recognize the virus component proteins as non-self. Cells of the immune system secrete type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines, initiating an antiviral state in neighboring cells and in the intercellular connective matrix, recruiting new immune mediators and new cells to the site of infection. This rapid response is crucial for limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we aimed at highlighting some microscopic aspects of the acute inflammatory reaction in the lung for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis of the histological pieces suggested that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction begins with the accumulation of immune cells in the interalveolar septa in response to viral insult, congestion of pulmonary vessels with increased blood volume in pulmonary vessels, followed by the presence of alveolar exudate, which reduces the area of hematosis and triggers respiratory symptoms. The inflammatory reaction was totally inhomogeneous, varying widely from patient to patient and even within the same patient, probably depending on the immune status, age or comorbidities. It presented two phases, a predominantly exudative phase (EP) and a predominantly proliferative phase (PP), intricately intertwined; sometimes, on the same histopathological piece, we identified both areas of incipient inflammatory reaction (EP) and a very intense reaction in the PP, suggesting that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction developed rapidly. The inflammatory infiltrate had a complex composition: neutrophilic leukocytes, macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The most abundant inflammatory cells were macrophages, both in the EP and PP. The use of anti-interleukin (IL) antibodies showed that ILs are mainly produced by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system, but also by conjunctival cells (fibroblasts).">

        <tr id="Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) initiates secondary inflammatory processes that exacerbate tissue damage, with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) playing a significant role in amplifying these cascades. This study aimed to explore the temporal dynamics and key regulatory genes of NET formation in SCI to identify therapeutic targets. Methods We integrated two transcriptomic datasets from the GEO database to identify differentially expressed NETs-related genes (NRGs) in SCI. WGCNA identified SCI-related modules, while GSVA assessed NET formation dynamics. Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database determined cell-specific expression patterns of key NRGs. Findings were validated through immunofluorescence, Western blot, and qPCR in a mouse SCI model. Regulatory networks were constructed, and potential therapeutic compounds were predicted using DSigDB and molecular docking. Results We identified seven key NRGs (Casp1, Ccl3, Fcgr2b, Itgam, Itgb2, Tlr2, Tlr4) in SCI. GSVA revealed peak NET score at day 1 post-injury, with attenuation at days 3 and 7. Single-cell transcriptome analysis demonstrated predominant expression of these key genes in neutrophils during the acute phase, most prominently at 1 day post-injury, which coincides with the most pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses confirmed significantly elevated NET formation at 1 day post-SCI. qPCR verified the expression of all key NRGs. Regulatory network analysis identified CHD1 as an important transcription factor governing NET formation, while miRNA-mRNA network construction revealed sophisticated post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms. Drug prediction analysis identified atorvastatin as a promising therapeutic candidate with strong binding affinity to multiple key NET-related proteins. Conclusion Our study provides insights into the temporal dynamics and molecular mechanisms of NET formation after SCI, identifying potential therapeutic targets to mitigate neutrophil-mediated secondary injury and improve functional outcomes.">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

        <tr id="Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected billions of individuals globally, with symptoms ranging from isolated blood clotting to severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intensive respiratory support ventilators. Those with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 5) were at high risk of severe disease faced a particularly heightened risk of severe illness. Inflammation and associated immune-thrombotic events in CKD stage 5 have attracted increasing attention, yet remain poorly understood. In this prospective cohort study, we examined and compared neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and low-density granulocytes (LDGs) in heathy controls (n = 15), CKD stage 5 patients without COVID-19 (n = 15), patients with COVID-19 (n = 15), and CKD stage 5 patients with COVID-19 (n = 90). Serum citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) and related gene expression (PAD4, ERK1, PKC), NET complexes, platelet factor 4 (PF4), von Willebrand factor (vWF), RANTES, and specific cytokines were quantified. Proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to assess the role of lipopolysaccharide-LDG complexes in NETs detected in COVID-19 plasma. NETs complexes were significantly higher in COVID-19 cases, and more so in patients with CKD stage 5D, and those who died. Disease severity was directly correlated with NETs complex levels (p = 0.016). CitH3 and gene expression levels were not correlated with advanced CKD stage, while levels of components that initiate NETs formation were higher in patients with COVID-19 and in CKD stage 5 patients. In conclusion, NET activation could partially explain the thrombotic manifestations in patients with COVID-19 and in CKD stage 5 patients.">

        <tr id="The non-polio enteroviruses enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) and enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71) are highly prevalent and considered pathogens of increasing health concern. While most enterovirus infections are mild and self-limiting, severe complications ranging from meningitis, encephalitis, to acute flaccid paralysis can occur, especially in children and immunocompromised patients. Despite the global burden of neurological complications caused by EV-D68 and EV-A71, the underlying neuropathogenesis remains poorly understood. In particular, the impact of the infection on neural function has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we compare the replication kinetics, cellular tropism, and electrophysiological effects of EV-D68 and EV-A71 infection in a physiologically relevant human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural co-culture model, consisting of excitatory neurons and astrocytes. Inoculation with contemporary circulating EV-D68 strains and an EV-A71 strain resulted in decreased neural activity in the co-cultures, with EV-D68 A2/2018 inducing the most rapid and robust negative effect on neural co-cultures, followed by EV-D68 B3/2019. EV-D68 strains preferentially infected neurons, whereas EV-A71 infection was detected in both cell types to the same extent. Despite the lack of viral release of infectious virus particles of EV-D68 B3/2019 in the supernatant, the infection could spread in the cultures and reduce neurotransmission. Higher viral load and broader tropism of EV-A71 did not result in enhanced impairment of neural function. Our results demonstrate that neurotropic non-polio enteroviruses lead to disruption of spontaneous neural activity in a virus-specific manner, which does not correlate with their replication efficiency.">

        <tr id="Despite targeting mainly the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 disrupts T cell homeostasis in ways that may explain both acute lethality and long-term immunological consequences. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the T-cell-mediated chain of immunity and formation of TCR via TREC assessment in COVID-19 and long COVID (LC). For this study, we collected 231 blood samples taken from patients with acute COVID-19 (n = 71), convalescents (n = 51), people diagnosed with LC (n = 63), and healthy volunteers (n = 46). With flow cytometry, we assessed levels of CD4+ and CD8+ minor T cell subpopulations (i.e., naïve, central and effector memory cells (CM and EM), Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, Tc17.1, and subpopulations of effector cells (pE1, pE2, effector cells)). Additionally, we measured TREC levels. We found distinct changes in immune cell distribution—whilst distribution of major subpopulations of T cells was similar between cohorts, we noted that COVID-19 was associated with a decrease in naïve Th and CTLs, an increase in Th2/Tc2 lymphocyte polarization, an increase in CM cells, and a decrease in effector memory cells 1,3, and TEMRA cells. LC was associated with naïve CTL increase, polarization towards Th2 population, and a decrease in Tc1, Tc2, Em2, 3, 4 cells. We also noted TREC correlating with naïve cells subpopulations. Our findings suggest ongoing immune dysregulation, possibly driven by persistent antigen exposure or tissue migration of effector cells. The positive correlation between TREC levels and naïve T cells in LC patients points to residual thymic activity. The observed Th2/Th17 bias supports the hypothesis that LC involves autoimmune mechanisms, potentially driven by molecular mimicry or loss of immune tolerance.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, a leading cause of global disability and mortality, encompass a wide range of brain disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and so on. These diseases are characterized by dynamic cellular heterogeneity and disrupted intercellular crosstalk, yet their molecular drivers remain incompletely resolved. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) dissects transcriptional diversity at cellular resolution, while spatial transcriptomics (ST) maps niche‐specific interactions within tissue architecture—complementary approaches that have revealed disease‐associated subpopulations, neural–glial communication, and microenvironmental remodeling. However, standalone omics layers inadequately capture the genetic, epigenetic, and functional cascades underlying CNS pathologies. Here, we highlight the transformative potential of integrating scRNA‐seq and ST with multiomic profiling to delineate spatially orchestrated molecular networks. Such multiomic convergence enables systematic deconstruction of molecular mechanisms and intercellular communication across disease progression. By correlating these signatures with clinical phenotypes, this strategy accelerates biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and therapeutic target identification. We further discuss challenges in data harmonization, subcellular spatial resolution, and computational scalability that must be addressed to realize personalized CNS medicine. This synthesis advocates for interdisciplinary frameworks to translate multiomic insights into mechanistically grounded diagnostics and therapies, ultimately bridging the gap between molecular discovery and precision clinical intervention.">

        <tr id="Background: Bone marrow serves as a source and reservoir of immune cells and plays a critical role in central nervous system diseases. Nociceptive neurons are widely distributed in the bone marrow, but their post-infarction changes and immunological functions remain largely unexplored. Methods: A mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and human skull bone marrow samples from stroke patients were analyzed. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling was manipulated via receptor knockout and targeted nanoparticle delivery. Immune responses were evaluated primarily through flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA sequencing. Results: Activation of nociceptive neurons after cerebral infarction promoted myeloid-biased hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and increased infiltration of myeloid cells into brain tissue, resulting in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. This regulatory mechanism was mediated by CGRP, which enhanced the proliferation and mobilization of downstream myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), ultimately improving stroke outcomes. To overcome the hypotensive side effects of CGRP, we employed aged neutrophil membrane-coated nanoparticles for its targeted delivery to bone marrow, achieving sustained release and enhanced efficacy. Conclusion: Nociceptive neurons critically modulate post-stroke bone marrow immune responses by releasing CGRP and activating MDSC. Targeted CGRP delivery to bone marrow represents a promising strategy to suppress neuroinflammation and improve neurological recovery after cerebral infarction.">

        <tr id="Abstract Mucosal immunity is an important correlate of protection against respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2. Comparing B cell responses in the upper respiratory tract following vaccination and infection may offer unique insights into mucosal immunity. Here, we characterized antigen-specific B cells in the tonsils, adenoids, and peripheral blood of children who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. SARS-CoV-2-specific switched memory B cells (B SM ) and germinal center B cells were found in the blood and pharyngeal lymphoid tissues after vaccination or infection. However, infection generated a higher proportion of IgA + B SM and CXCR3 + CD21 + B SM , which showed distinct spatial localization, greater clonal expansion and increased propensity for plasma cell differentiation compared to their CXCR3 - counterparts, accompanied by persistent activation of innate and T follicular helper cells in the tissues. Our data provide evidence for tissue-specific B cell memory after either SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection, but with distinct characteristics that can influence the quality, durability, and localization of immunity.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 7 million deaths, but its legacy extends beyond mortality. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces immune alterations that persist post-recovery, manifesting not only in long COVID (LC) but also in healthy individuals. Cytokines serve as critical orchestrators of these processes. The goal of this study is to investigate post-pandemic immune remodeling through cytokine assessment in both patients with LC and healthy donor, and to compare the post-pandemic population with pre-pandemic controls to find changes in the immune responses and cytokine profiles. A panel of 47 immune mediators (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) was measured with the MAGPIX multiplex analysis. LC was characterized by an increase in IL-7, IL-8, IL-17F, IL-18, EGF, FGF-2, PDGF-AA, sCD40L, and MCP-3 and a decrease in IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, IL-27, and FLT-3L. Comparing post-pandemic recovered individuals with pre-pandemic healthy cohort, we saw an upregulation of IL-13 and MCP-3 and a downregulation of MDC, M-CSF, IL-12, and IL-17F. While LC is characterized by persistent immune imbalance—particularly in cytokine networks—our data emphasize the critical need to study healthy donors in both pre- and post-pandemic eras when analyzing and interpreting these changes.">

Here, we investigated H1N1-induced liver damage and its potential mechanisms using a BALB/c mouse infection model. Pathological examination and serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were assessed. Messenger ribonucleic acid-sequence was used to analyze the transcriptomic changes in tissues. Multiple inflammatory cytokines in tissues and inflammatory cells in the blood were detected on the fifth day post-infection. Our results showed that H1N1 infection caused significant liver pathology and elevated serum AST/ALT levels. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in liver gene expression profiles following H1N1 infection, particularly in genes associated with inflammatory responses, including those involved in monocyte adhesion/activation and neutrophil/macrophage infiltration. Marked increases in inflammatory mediators were observed in lungs, serum, and liver, accompanied by systemic changes in circulating inflammatory cells, indicating H1N1 triggered a robust systemic inflammatory response. These findings suggest that H1N1-induced liver damage may be associated with the systemic inflammatory response induced by H1N1 and changes in liver gene regulation.">

        <tr id="Introduction COVID-19 is associated with an inflammatory pathophysiology and, when associated with chronic diseases, can trigger severe infection and increase death risk. Irisin, a hormone produced by skeletal muscle during physical activity, has demonstrated therapeutic effects against metabolic disorders and exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. There is great interest in investigating irisin’s influence on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells. The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of irisin in viral infection in monolayers (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures of human subcutaneous adipocytes infected with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PV). Materials and methods Preadipocytes were cultured to maturity in 2D or 3D conditions and divided into four groups: Group 1: adipocytes with no treatment; Group 2: adipocytes optimized for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression; Group 3: adipocytes optimized for ACE2 expression, and then exposed to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (ACE2+PV); and Group 4: adipocytes treated with irisin 20 nM for 24 h, optimized for ACE2 expression and exposed to PV (ACE2+I+PV). Fluorescence levels of SARS-CoV-2 PV and ACE2 were measured to investigate cell infection; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity to investigate cytotoxicity; and malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonylation to assess oxidative stress levels. Results and discussion Irisin significantly reduced viral particle (PV) capture in 2D and 3D conditions. In addition, irisin decreased LDH release, MDA, and protein carbonylation levels, both in 2D and 3D conditions. Conclusion The results indicate irisin as a promising therapeutic target against COVID-19 pathophysiology by reducing viral entry into adipose cells as well as reducing cytotoxicity and oxidative stress indicators.">

At least 10% of individuals with a previous infection may develop long COVID, which affects their ability to perform daily functions and work. Despite its severity and widespread impact, this multisystemic condition remains poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of the complement system, a key component of the innate immune response, may contribute to the pathogenesis of long COVID, particularly in connection with coagulation, inflammation, and vascular injury.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aims Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Substantial evidence implicates a central role for CD4+ T cells in MS pathogenesis, particularly IFN‐γ+ Th1 cells and IL‐17+ Th17 cells. NF‐κB plays an essential role in regulating the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, which typically mediate inflammatory responses as self‐triggers. QNZ is a highly selective inhibitor of NF‐κB transcriptional activation. In this study, we assessed the impact of QNZ on CD4+ T‐cell polarization in MS. Utilizing the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, we investigated these aspects of MS. Method EAE was induced in C57BL/6 female mice by active immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35–55 peptide. QNZ was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) once every 2 days after the first immunization. Disease severity was clinically assessed and histopathologically assessed in the CNS. Phenotyping of CD4+ T cells was performed by flow cytometry in the spleen and cervical lymph nodes. Results Prophylactic administration of QNZ to EAE mice suppressed the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells and demyelination within the spinal cord. Notably, QNZ also reduced the proportion of IFN‐γ+IL‐17+ Th17.1 cells, potentially playing a critical role in MS pathogenesis. Conclusions Quinazoline derivative QNZ could suppress neuroinflammation, alleviate the progression of EAE and be associated with reduced Th1 and Th17 immunity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Many SARS‐CoV‐2 patients experience chronic pulmonary symptoms and long‐term inflammation despite viral clearance. While these clinical manifestations have been linked to the dysregulation of the adaptive immune response, the underlying immunopathology remains poorly understood due to a lack of suitable animal models. To investigate long‐term pulmonary consequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, we used a genetic cross of 129 mice and C57BL/6 (B6)‐K18‐hACE2 transgene mice, a model previously shown to survive infection. 129xB6‐K18‐hACE2 mice or littermate controls were infected with a low dose (5 × 102 PFU) of ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2. Complete viral clearance and full recovery from weight loss occurred by day 8 post‐infection. However, prolonged inflammation in the lung and airways persisted up to day 28 post‐infection and was associated with the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly CD8+ effector T cells. This model may therefore prove valuable for further understanding of drivers of long‐term lung inflammation and for testing therapeutic strategies and clinically relevant interventions that can target long‐term pulmonary inflammation following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Oropouche virus (OROV) historically caused a self-limiting disease, yet recent strains are associated with congenital infection and neurodevelopmental disruption. These cases highlight a need to study OROV as a congenital pathogen and determine the impact of infection on neurodevelopment. Here, we show that OROV is vertically transmitted and induces a microcephaly-like phenotype in human forebrain organoids. We found OROV robustly infects human neural progenitor cells in organoids. In contrast to ZIKV, OROV had a heightened capacity for infection and organoid pathology. We show this increased pathogenesis is partially attributable to OROV antagonism of innate immune signaling. We further demonstrate that OROV is vertically transmitted and infects the fetal tissues in a murine model of congenital infection. Our results demonstrate that OROV can be vertically transmitted and has heightened capacity for neurodevelopmental disruption. These findings underscore need for monitoring OROV as a re-emerging virus capable of inducing microcephaly in infected fetuses.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has converged with the HIV epidemic. Although immunocompromised patients show an elevated risk of death due to COVID-19 compared to HIV infection, the impact remains contradictory. One reason could be the use of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Patients with HIV receiving ARV, such as tenofovir (TDF), have fewer symptoms of COVID-19. In mice, bleomycin (BLM) induces acute lung injury, resulting in an acute inflammatory response similar to the cytokine storm and lung damage observed in COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the preventive role of TDF administration prior to BLM administration. A total of 64 eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, France), both male and female, were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n = 8 per sex per group): (i) oral TDF administered in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by oropharyngeal aspiration (OA) of saline on day 7 (TDF); (ii) oral TDF in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (TDF-BLM); (iii) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of saline on day 7 (SAL); and (iv) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (BLM). Animals were euthanized 72 h after OA (day 10), and serum and lung tissues were collected for analysis. TDF-BLM lungs showed significantly reduced bronchioalveolar lavage fluid total cell counts, specifically reduced macrophages and neutrophils counts, but an increased presence of minority lymphocytes. TDF downregulated BLM-induced levels of Il1β, Il6, TNFα, and Tgfβ mRNA. Preventive treatment with TDF counteracted BLM-induced alveolar and bronchiolar cell damage. Male mice showed more severe symptoms after BLM administration for most parameters, and the preventive action of TDF was similar in both sexes. Preventive TDF administration partially counteracted BLM-induced acute lung injury. These findings support epidemiological observations suggesting a potential benefit of TDF as a prophylactic therapy against COVID-19, at least in HIV-infected patients.">

Subsequently, the graft is re-infected early in the post-procedural phase, leading to viral persistence for more than five months. By analyzing viral evolution and effector immune response within the transplanted organ, we observe three main findings. First, virus evolution differs in the transplanted organ compared to that in the upper respiratory tract and is affected by monoclonal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and molnupiravir. Second, we show the potential clinical relevance of T cell HLA restriction that may facilitate viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract compared to the ongoing viral replication in the HLA mismatch organ. Third, close monitoring and modulation of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy enables viral clearance in a lung transplantation setting despite incomplete SARS-CoV-2 clearance prior to transplantation.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause skeletal muscle, myocardial, and gastrointestinal lesions. However, it is currently unclear whether these lesions are caused directly by viral infection or indirectly after infection and whether there are differences between different animal models. Here, we first compared the pathological changes of skeletal muscle, myocardium, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle of different COVID-19 animal models (rhesus monkey, hamster, ferret, hACE2 transgenic mice, hACE2-K18 transgenic mice, mink, and cat), and analyzed the possible mechanism of pathological changes. Within 5-7 days of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, the three types of muscles in these models were all damaged and inflammatory response to varying degrees, and infiltrating inflammatory cells and factors mainly included CD4T, CD8T cells, macrophages, a small amount of B cells, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, and so on. Among them, the pathological changes of the three muscle tissues in the rhesus monkey model were the most significant and closely related to clinical manifestations. It was determined that SARS-CoV-2 can infect these three types of muscles through in situ hybridization and electron microscopy analysis. Therefore, the performance of muscle lesions in each model was not completely consistent and may be related to multiple factors after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including animal species, direct virus invasion, systemic inflammation after infection, and immune status of the body. This study provides a foundation for selecting models to study muscle lesion mechanisms and treatment strategies, highlighting the need for clinical attention to muscle tissue involvement in COVID-19 patients.">

Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation is another major pathophysiological event in ALS, but it remains unclear whether immune system dysregulation contributes to this process. Here, we report leukocyte and macrophage infiltration in ALS patient-derived skeletal muscle biopsies. Immune cell infiltration was replicated across the hTDP-43, TDP-43A315T (male only) and TDP-43M337V mouse models, occurring from pre-symptomatic stages and targeted to NMJ-enriched muscle regions. Proteomic analysis implicated the CCL2-CCR2 axis as a driving factor. CCL2+ cells were enriched around NMJs in hTDP-43 mice, and in ALS patient skeletal muscle. Local treatment with CCL2-neutralising antibodies or normal IgG antibodies in hTDP-43 mice reduced leukocyte infiltration and ameliorated NMJ denervation. These results demonstrate that the CCL2-CCR2 axis drives immune cell infiltration targeting NMJs in ALS, identifying a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention to prevent NMJ denervation.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a global health crisis complicated by immune dysregulation and T cell exhaustion. CD39, an ectonucleotidase generating immunosuppressive adenosine, is implicated in cancer and chronic infections, yet its spatiotemporal role in TB pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Multiple publicly available datasets were utilized to evaluate CD39 across TB disease stages, diverse infectious diseases and anti-TB treatment. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated via ROC curves and combined signature analysis. Immune cell infiltration were analyzed using CIBERSORTx. Cytokine profiles and age-stratified associations were examined. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by GSEA. Single-cell analysis of non-human primate granulomas assessed CD39’s temporal dynamics, utilizing Monocle 3 for CD39+ T-cell trajectory analysis. Results CD39 was upregulated in active TB patients versus TB infection (TBI) and healthy controls (HC), correlating with older age, disease severity, and distinct expression patterns compared to other respiratory and systemic infections. CD39 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy over IFN-γ in distinguishing TB from TBI/HC and other respiratory diseases. Combining CD39 with TBX21 or GZMB further improved diagnostic specificity. High CD39 expression correlated with suppressed Th1 and elevated Th2/Th17/regulatory cytokines, alongside pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Age-stratified analysis revealed complex age-dependent associations of CD39 expression with various immune cell types. Single-cell analysis revealed declining CD39 transcriptional activity during prolonged infection despite expanded cellular distribution, linked to early T cell maturation followed by broader immunomodulatory shifts. Decreased CD39 expression with anti-TB treatment correlated with improved immune cell balance and resolved T cell exhaustion. Conclusion CD39 is a critical regulator of immune exhaustion and neutrophil-driven inflammation in TB, with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Targeting CD39 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for TB.">

        <tr id="The pathology of Parkinson’s disease is defined by α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation into neuronal Lewy bodies, which may lead to chronic neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Misfolded α-syn activates Toll-like receptor signaling in microglia, leading to downstream activation of NF-κB and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines recruit pro-inflammatory myeloid cells from circulation, thereby amplifying neuroinflammation. Thus, reducing microglial activation and myeloid cell infiltration has the potential to reduce neuroinflammation and PD pathology. Here, we investigated a targeted immunomodulatory strategy using LA1, a novel, small-molecule agonist of CD11b, a β2 integrin receptor highly and selectively expressed on myeloid cells and microglia. CD11b has key roles in cell adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis. Previous work has demonstrated that CD11b agonism via LA1 transiently enhances integrin-mediated adhesion that limits immune cell transmigration and tissue infiltration. CD11b agonism also suppresses TLR-driven inflammatory signaling and myeloid cell activation. To evaluate its efficacy in vivo, we utilized pre-clinical Parkinson’s disease model by stereotaxically delivering AAV2-SYN to induce α-synuclein overexpression in the murine midbrain. Mice were treated with oral LA1 for four or eight weeks and analyzed. LA1 treatment significantly reduced microglial activation and decreased brain infiltration of peripheral immune cells, thereby attenuating α-synuclein-induced neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that CD11b agonism may offer a dual-action therapeutic approach in Parkinson’s disease by dampening pro-inflammatory responses by central and peripheral myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability across all age groups worldwide. After primary mechanical head injury, a cascade of molecular changes and immunological responses occur that are necessary for supporting tissue repair but also exacerbate the secondary loss of tissue caused by excessive neuroinflammation. To date, there are no targeted treatments that ameliorate the pathological neuroinflammation that is responsible for propagating secondary injury after TBI. Recent works have highlighted the adaptive immune system's response to TBI, with mounting evidence suggesting that T cells play a critical yet understudied role in propagating secondary injury while also potentially supporting reparative processes. Objectives We critically review the current literature to discuss the diverse functionality of T cells in TBI including the temporospatial characteristics of their response, mechanisms of their activation, and their contributions to the overall neuroinflammatory profile. Consideration is given for additional pathological factors that may further alter these properties. We additionally summarize previous reports of therapeutic T cell modulation in this setting and identify approaches warranting additional investigation. Finally, we discuss major gaps in the existing literature and recommend future research perspectives. Conclusion Evidence suggests several aspects of the T cell response to TBI may serve as beneficial therapeutic targets for limiting secondary injury. Additional translational investigations are warranted and may support the development of effective therapeutic strategies for treating patients post‐head trauma.">

However, current disease-modifying therapies demonstrate limited efficacy in addressing progressive disease subtypes, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we systematically review the neuroimmune interactions underlying the pathogenesis of MS, with a focus on three key aspects: the immune niche, immune cell types, and cell-based therapies. We first discuss the evolution of brain-immune concepts, from early notions of immune privilege to modern understandings of brain-border immune niches (meninges, choroid plexus, and perivascular spaces). These compartments serve as critical interfaces where peripheral immune cells interact with CNS-resident immune cells. We then analyze the roles of specific immune cell subsets (e.g., T/B cells, myeloid cells and microglia) in disease progression, highlighting their functional heterogeneity across different MS subtypes. Furthermore, we highlight emerging MS immunotherapies-including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T regimens, mesenchymal stem cell interventions, microbiome modulation, and nanodelivery systems, which strategically target mechanistic nodes spanning neuroimmune niche regulation, inflammatory cascade blockade, and CNS neurorestorative capacities.">

        <tr id="Vasculitis and vascular injury are induced in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, suggesting an association between multi-organ failure and sequelae. Vascular endothelial dysfunction induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disrupts vascular barrier function, activates coagulation pathways, and induces extravasation of inflammatory cells. In addition to employing standard anti-inflammatory and antiviral agents, using treatments that stabilize and protect blood vessels following SARS-CoV-2 infection is a potentially effective strategy to relieve COVID-19 severity. Here, we focused on the vasoprotective effects of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid mediator with diverse activities, and investigated whether it could be a novel therapeutic for COVID-19. Three-dimensional cultures of various human vascular endothelial cells that form luminal structures showed increased expression of LPA4 and entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, mimicking blood vessels in vivo. Validation using this culture system showed that LPA attenuated SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced vascular destruction and the activation of inflammatory signaling. In experiments with infected animals, LPA administration protected blood vessels and suppressed inflammation and vascular damage in lung tissue. The activation of LPA signaling in vascular endothelial cells may be an effective therapeutic approach for mitigating vascular injury in COVID-19.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a wide range of acute and chronic disease manifestations. While most infections are mild, a significant number of patients develop severe illness marked by respiratory failure, thromboinflammation, and multi-organ dysfunction. In addition, post-acute sequelae—commonly known as long-COVID—can persist for months. Recent studies have identified the emergence of diverse autoantibodies in COVID-19, including those targeting nuclear antigens, phospholipids, type I interferons, cytokines, endothelial components, and G-protein-coupled receptors. These autoantibodies are more frequently detected in patients with moderate to severe disease and have been implicated in immune dysregulation, vascular injury, and persistent symptoms. This review examines the underlying immunological mechanisms driving autoantibody production during SARS-CoV-2 infection—including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, and bystander activation—and discusses their functional roles in acute and post-acute disease.

A comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced autoantibodies may improve risk stratification, inform clinical management, and guide the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies.">

        <tr id="Significance Despite the established link between COVID-19 and vascular endothelial dysfunction, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our study provides the direct evidence of angiotensin-convertingenzyme 2 (ACE2)-independent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uptake in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which is significantly enhanced in aging and triggers a proinflammatory response. We reveal a molecular pathway linking endothelial senescence to increased viral susceptibility and inflammatory pathology, explaining why aging is a major risk factor for severe COVID-19. These findings not only resolve a long-standing controversy regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection of ECs but also identify senescent ECs as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating severe COVID-19 complications.">

        <tr id="Background. Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, but efforts to develop efficacious neuroprotective therapy face ongoing challenges. Efferocytosis, the phagocytic clearance of dying cells, by microglia is crucial for limiting neuroinflammation and promoting stroke resolution. Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is an inflammatory mediator which impairs macrophage bacterial phagocytosis in sepsis and radiation injury, but its role in microglial efferocytosis in ischemic stroke has not yet been studied. Results. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model of ischemic stroke, we demonstrate that eCIRP is released into the cerebrospinal fluid and microglial expression of crucial efferocytic receptor MerTK decreases in tMCAO mice. CIRP deficiency significantly improved neurological deficit, MerTK expression and microglial efferocytosis in tMCAO mice. Utilizing tMCAO, hippocampal injections, and primary microglia, we show that eCIRP induces pro-inflammatory micro-RNA 155 (miR-155) via TLR4, which suppresses its target pro-efferocytic transcription factor MAF bZIP (MafB), downregulating MerTK and microglial efferocytosis. Pharmacological blockade of eCIRP–TLR4 interaction using small peptide C23 attenuates miR-155 induction, restores MerTK expression, rescues microglial efferocytosis, and improves outcomes in tMCAO mice. Conclusion. We show that eCIRP causes microglial efferocytic dysfunction in ischemic stroke via TLR4/miR-155/MafB axis. These findings uncover a previously unknown pathway through which eCIRP signaling impairs neuroprotective function in microglia and suggest that targeting eCIRP may promote functional recovery after stroke.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections. This leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells some of which remain within the lung and contribute to enhanced pathogen control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells also display long-term changes following infection. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection finding that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes linked to communication with T cells. MHCI and MHCII proteins continue to be expressed at higher levels in both differentiated epithelial cells and progenitor populations and several differentially expressed genes are downstream of the transcription factor, SpiB, a known orchestrator of antigen presentation. Lung epithelial cells from influenza-infected mice display functional changes, more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells display characteristics of immune memory which could affect outcomes that are protective in the context of infection or pathogenic in chronic inflammatory disorders.">

However, the immunological mechanisms underlying these clinical phenotypes remain unclear. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study including 117 MS patients and 84 healthy controls (HC). Patients were stratified as NLGL (low sNfL and sGFAP), NH (high sNfL at different levels of sGFAP), and NLGH (low sNfL and high sGFAP). Percentages of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mononuclear cells, and intracellular production of cytokines by T and B cells after “in vitro” stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results We identified a common inflammatory profile present in the blood of all MS groups comprising significant increases of effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, of memory and antigen-presenting B cells, of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing interferon-gamma, interleukin-17 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and of B cells producing TNF-α. Additionally, the highly inflammatory NH group showed lower frequencies of different regulatory subsets (transitional B cells, PDL1+ monocytes and Treg cells) compared to HC and increased percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and of effector CD56dim NK cells. They also showed lower percentages of Treg in blood and CSF compared to the low inflammatory NLGL group, which also displayed higher frequencies of regulatory CD56dim, NKG2A+ cells. Conclusion All MS patients share increased inflammatory B and T cells, but differ in regulatory or NK subsets, which identify highly inflammatory or benign disease courses.">

        <tr id="Disruption of the gut microenvironment is a hallmark of HIV infection, where regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in maintaining gut homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which gut Tregs contribute to immune reconstitution failure in HIV-infected individuals remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze gut Treg populations across three cohorts: eight immunological responders (IRs), three immunological non-responders (INRs), and four HIV-negative controls (NCs). Our findings revealed that INRs exhibit an increased proportion of gut Tregs but with significant functional impairments, including reduced suppressive capacity and heightened apoptotic activity. Notably, these Tregs underwent metabolic reprogramming in INRs, marked by an upregulation of glycolysis-related genes and a downregulation of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway. Additionally, both the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and SCFA concentrations were reduced in INRs. In vitro SCFA supplementation restored Treg function by enhancing suppressive capacity, reducing early apoptosis, and rebalancing cellular energy metabolism from glycolysis to OXPHOS. These findings provide a comprehensive characterization of gut Treg dysfunction in INRs and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting gut Tregs through microbiota and metabolite supplementation to improve immune reconstitution in HIV-infected individuals.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Immune induction under B‐cell depletion is complex and far from being fully understood. Methods We investigated clinical and immunological responses after dual homologous mRNA vaccination with BNT162b2 and after booster vaccination or infection in 14 B‐cell depleted patients with inflammatory central nervous system disease in comparison to 28 healthy controls. Spike‐specific IgG were determined using ELISA and neutralizing activity by surrogate assay. Reactive T cells were flow‐cytometrically analyzed after spike‐specific and polyclonal stimulation. Reactogenicity was self‐reported using a questionnaire. Results Vaccination was well tolerated, with slightly more systemic events reported by patients. Spike‐specific antibodies were induced in all controls, but only 43% of patients with significantly lower IgG levels and reduced neutralizing capacity (p < 0.0001). In contrast, spike‐reactive T cells were induced in both groups with similar CD4 and higher CD8 T‐cell levels in patients. Functional characterization of spike‐reactive T cells revealed equally high CTLA‐4 expression in both groups, but higher proportions of polyfunctional, triple‐cytokine expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells in patients especially after the third immunization. Three patients experienced mild breakthrough infections after second vaccination. Conclusions Despite limited ability of B‐cell depleted patients to mount a humoral immune response after multiple doses of SARS‐CoV‐2 mRNA vaccination, the vaccine‐induced T‐cell response is robust, which may have implications for protection against severe disease.">

        <tr id="Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant became the dominant driver during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high transmissibility and immune escape potential. Although clinical outcomes are generally mild to moderate, the inflammatory mechanisms triggered by Omicron subvariants remain poorly defined. The goal of this study was to consider both viral evolution and the host immune response by assessing plasma cytokine levels in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Methods: A total of 115 individuals were recruited, including 40 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR. Demographic, clinical, and comorbidity data were collected. Plasma levels of IL-6, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17A were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array. Subvariant data were obtained from GISAID records and grouped into early (BA.1-lineage) and late (BA.4/BA.5-lineage) Omicron clusters. Statistical analysis included non-parametric and parametric tests, correlation matrices, and multivariate comparisons. Results: Pharyngitis, nasal discharge, cough, and headache were the most common symptoms among infected individuals. Despite no significant variation in symptom distribution across subvariants, infected patients showed higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-2 compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected controls (p < 0.05). IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in early Omicron infections. No associations were observed between cytokine levels and comorbidities. A significant correlation was found between reporting fewer symptoms and having received three vaccine doses. Conclusions: Infection with Omicron subvariants elicits a strong yet balanced cytokine response. Despite genetic divergence between lineages, immune and clinical patterns remain conserved, with vaccination appearing to mitigate the symptom burden.">

Due to its immunogenic properties, SARS-CoV-2 N protein also interacts with host factors associated with various pre-existing inflammatory conditions and may possibly contribute to the long-term symptoms suffered by some COVID-19 patients after recovery—known as long COVID.

        <tr id="Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) is a severe disease that occurs weeks to months after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, often occurring in children (MISC). Symptoms include high fever, rash, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Children with MISC can develop cardiovascular injury including ventricular failure, coronary artery aneurysms, or shock. Current treatment strategies for these postacute sequelae of COVID-19 primarily target the hyperinflammatory response. However, a potential role for viral spike protein translocated via zonulin-mediated trafficking from gastrointestinal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation has been suggested. Here, we report results from a phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial testing the zonulin antagonist larazotide in 12 children with MISC with a median age of 5.7 years. Children were enrolled during hospitalization for acute MISC and were treated with adjuvant larazotide therapy four times daily for 3 weeks. Patients were monitored for 24 weeks for safety follow-up. No larazotide-related adverse events were reported. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen in blood samples correlated with inflammatory markers, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (P = 0.004) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P < 0.0001), and with gastrointestinal symptoms as assessed by the PedsQL GI symptom score (P = 0.003). Children treated with larazotide displayed faster resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms, faster clearance of spike antigen, and a faster return to usual activities. Our findings suggest that larazotide treatment may be safe in children and may improve resolution of symptoms when used as an adjuvant therapy for MISC.">

        <tr id="The focal “hot spot” neuropathologies in COVID-19 infection are revealing footprints of a hidden underlying collapse of a novel ultrafast ultradian Piezo2 signaling system within the nervous system. Paradoxically, the same initiating pathophysiology may underpin the systemic findings in COVID-19 infection, namely the multiorgan SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced vascular pathologies and brain–body-wide systemic pro-inflammatory signaling, depending on the concentration and exposure to infecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This common initiating microdamage is suggested to be the primary damage or the acquired channelopathy of the Piezo2 ion channel, leading to a principal gateway to pathophysiology. This Piezo2 channelopathy-induced neural switch could not only explain the initiation of disrupted cell–cell interactions, metabolic failure, microglial dysfunction, mitochondrial injury, glutamatergic synapse loss, inflammation and neurological states with the central involvement of the hippocampus and the medulla, but also the initiating pathophysiology without SARS-CoV-2 viral intracellular entry into neurons as well. Therefore, the impairment of the proposed Piezo2-induced quantum mechanical free-energy-stimulated ultrafast proton-coupled tunneling seems to be the principal and critical underlying COVID-19 infection-induced primary damage along the brain axes, depending on the loci of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and intracellular entry. Moreover, this initiating Piezo2 channelopathy may also explain resultant autonomic dysregulation involving the medulla, hippocampus and heart rate regulation, not to mention sleep disturbance with altered rapid eye movement sleep and cognitive deficit in the short term, and even as a consequence of long COVID. The current opinion piece aims to promote future angles of science and research in order to further elucidate the not entirely known initiating pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Gene expression profile was further confirmed using real-time PCR. Results: Acute infection showed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Long-term MHV-1 infection led to the sustained upregulation of genes involved in muscle regeneration, cytoskeletal remodeling, and fibrotic responses. Notably, both expression and variability of SLC22 and SLC22A8, key proximal tubule transporters, were reduced, suggesting a loss of segment-specific identity. Further, SLC12A1, a critical regulator of sodium reabsorption and blood pressure, was downregulated and is associated with the onset of polyuria and hydronephrosis. SLC transporters exhibited expression patterns consistent with tubular dysfunction and inflammation. These findings suggest aberrant activation of myogenic pathways and structural proteins in renal tissues, consistent with a pro-fibrotic phenotype. In contrast, SPK treatment reversed the expression of most genes, thereby restoring the gene profiles to those observed in control mice. Conclusions: MHV-1-induced long COVID is associated with persistent transcriptional reprogramming in the kidney, indicative of chronic inflammation, cytoskeletal dysregulation, and fibrogenesis. SPK demonstrates robust therapeutic potential by normalizing these molecular signatures and preventing long-term renal damage. These findings underscore the relevance of the MHV-1 model and support further investigation of SPK as a candidate therapy for COVID-19-associated renal sequelae.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection was responsible for the pandemic COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) and caused a range of symptoms, including gastrointestinal disorders and abdominal pain, making COVID-19 a multi-organ dysfunction. It is known that the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is expressed also in the gut, where SARS-CoV-2 could induce vascular damage and immune system dysregulation, similarly to what has been widely described in the lung1. This case report concerns a middle-aged man admitted to the Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy) and tested negative to the nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks after recovering from the infection. Due to thrombotic and hemorragic gut conditions, accompanied by severe ulceration, the patient underwent resection of a segment of ileum. Immunohistochemical analyses showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared to the non-ulcerated one2. Moreover, expression and co-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibronectin (FN) were analyzed. VEGF expression was increased in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared with control and non-ulcerated ileum. FN staining was progressively increasing in non-ulcerated and ulcerated ileum. By electron microscopy the microvilli alteration of brush border and of intercellular junctions were detected in the ulcerated area but not in other areas of patient’s ileum or in the control sample. The salient aspect of this study is that although the patient was declared negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the respiratory level, SPIKE and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins were still present in the ileum, concentrated in the ulcerated area and parallelled by an increased expression of vascular markers. The ultrastructural analysis gave insights on the morpho-functional effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection on the gut epithelium, indicating that the damage is not limited to vascular structures.">

        <tr id="Background: There is growing evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to metabolic dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which may impair liver function and promote glucose intolerance. This study investigated the role of SARS-CoV-2, specifically its Main Protease (Mpro), in accelerating insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in HepG2 cells in vitro. Methods: HepG2 cells were treated with varying concentrations of Mpro (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 nmol/mL) for 24 h to assess cytotoxicity and glucose uptake. Based on initial findings, subsequent assays focused on higher concentrations (40, 80, and 160 nmol/mL). The effects of Mpro on cell viability, protein kinase B (AKT) expression, matrix metallopeptidase-1 (MMP1), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and lipid peroxidation were investigated. Results: Our findings reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro treatment led to a concentration-dependent reduction in glucose uptake in HepG2 cells. Additionally, the Mpro treatment was associated with reduced insulin-stimulated AKT activation, particularly at higher concentrations. Inflammatory markers such as IL-6 were elevated in the extracellular medium, while DPP4 expression was decreased. However, extracellular soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) levels did not show a significant change. Despite these changes, cell viability remained relatively unaffected, suggesting that the HepG2 cells were able to maintain overall metabolic functions under Mpro exposure. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the concentration-dependent impairment of hepatic glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, and inflammatory pathways in HepG2 cells acutely exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. These findings warrant further investigation to explore the long-term metabolic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its proteases in the liver and to develop potential therapeutic approaches for post-viral metabolic complications.">

        <tr id="The interleukin-2 receptor γ (IL-2Rγ, or γc) is a crucial component of several cytokine receptor complexes. Deficiencies in γc lead to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), characterized by recurrent infections due to the absence or dysfunction of T and NK cells, and nonfunctional B cells. Missense variants in the γc extracellular region are linked to atypical X-SCID with normal counts of T, B, and NK cells and less severe symptoms, yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. This study describes a case of atypical X-SCID with a missense variant (c.420 A > T, p.R140S) in the γc extracellular domain, associated with recurrent bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. We found that the R140S variant leads to reduced surface expression and variably affects cytokine receptor signaling. Specifically, STAT5 phosphorylation and proliferation in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells are impaired in response to IL-7, a cytokine essential for T cell survival, proliferation and function. Notably, γcR140S predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, in contrast to WT γc, which is found in acidic compartments. Despite this mislocalization, γcR140S does not trigger unfolded protein responses, and its protein stability and degradation pathways remain unaffected. Nevertheless, cells expressing high levels of γcR140S exhibited a competitive disadvantage in culture compared to those expressing WT γc, resulting in the enrichment of cells expressing lower levels of γcR140S. These findings extend our understanding of how mutations in the extracellular domain of γc can lead to reduced protein expression and influence the pathophysiology of atypical X-SCID.

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the severe progression of an infection with Plasmodium falciparum, causing detrimental damage to brain tissue and is the most frequent cause of Plasmodium falciparum mortality. The critical role of brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the pathophysiology of CM having been revealed, our investigation focuses on the role of NR2F6, an established immune checkpoint, as a candidate driver of CM pathology. We employed an experimental mouse model of CM based on Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection to compare the relative susceptibility of Nr2f6-knock-out and wild-type C57BL6/N mice. As a remarkable result, Nr2f6 deficiency confers a significant survival benefit. In terms of mechanism, we detected less severe endotheliopathy and, hence, less damage to the blood–brain barrier (BBB), accompanied by decreased sequestered parasites and less cytotoxic T-lymphocytes within the brain, manifesting in a better disease outcome. We present evidence that NR2F6 deficiency renders mice more resistant to experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), confirming a causal and non-redundant role for NR2F6 in the progression of ECM disease. Consequently, pharmacological inhibitors of the NR2F6 pathway could be of use to bolster BBB integrity and protect against CM.">

        <tr id="Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), marked by persistent symptoms lasting weeks to months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, affects multiple organ systems including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and renal systems. These prolonged effects stem from chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and direct viral injury. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)—small non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation—play a pivotal role in this process by modulating immune responses, inflammation, and cellular stress. Altered miRNA expression patterns during and after infection contribute to the pathogenesis of Long COVID. While conventional miRNA detection techniques have been valuable, they face limitations in sensitivity, throughput, and detecting RNA modifications. This review highlights Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONS) as a promising alternative, offering real-time, long-read, amplification-free RNA sequencing that preserves native modifications. ONS enables direct sequencing of full-length miRNAs and their precursors, providing novel insights into miRNA processing and regulatory roles. Despite current challenges with short-read accuracy, ongoing technical advances are improving ONS performance. Its integration in miRNA profiling holds significant potential for uncovering novel regulatory interactions and advancing clinical biomarker discovery in Long COVID and other conditions.">

        <tr id="Cytokine storm (CS) is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Hypoxic signaling has been proposed to influence proinflammatory pathways and to be involved in the development of CS. Here, for the first time, the role of hypoxia in coronavirus-mediated inflammation has been investigated, using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Analysis of the transcriptome of A549 lung epithelial cells using RNA sequencing revealed 191 mRNAs which were synergistically upregulated and 43 mRNAs which were synergistically downregulated by the combination of human Betacoronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) infection and hypoxia. Synergistically upregulated mRNAs were strongly associated with inflammatory pathway activation. Analysis of the expression of 105 cytokines and immune-related proteins using antibody arrays identified five proteins (IGFBP-3, VEGF, CCL20, CD30, and myeloperoxidase) which were markedly upregulated in HCoV-OC43 infection in hypoxia compared to HCoV-OC43 infection in normal oxygen conditions. Our findings show that COVID-19 patients with lung hypoxia may face increased risk of inflammatory complications. Two of the proteins we have identified as synergistically upregulated, the cytokines VEGF and CCL20, represent potential future therapeutic targets. These could be targeted directly or, based on the novel findings described here by inhibiting hypoxia signaling pathways, to reduce excessive inflammatory cytokine responses in patients with severe infections.">

The authors used an autopsy platform allowing morphological and biochemical/molecular biological investigations in postmortem mirror blocks prepared from the brain and peripheral organs of 13 COVID and 23 non- COVID-infected patients. Microglia are resident macrophages of the brain, representing a ﬁ rst defense wall in the case of any type of bacterial or viral infection. 2 They possess G protein-coupled purinergic P2Y12 receptors (Rs) that sense ADP, arising from the enzymatic degradation of ATP that ﬂ ows out from glial/ neuronal cells after damage, caused by infections or metabolic disturbances. P2Y12Rs are localized at the membrane of the cytoplasmic processes of microglia; increased levels of locally generated ADP attract the active elongation of these processes to approach the sites of injury and later the migration of ameboid microglia to these sites. 3 Immuno ﬂ uorescence was used for quanti ﬁ cation of the levels of P2Y12Rs in the gyrus rectus of the frontal cortex and the medulla oblongata; a lower expression of this receptor was reported in COVID-af ﬂ icted microglia. The resulting shortfall in the recognition of ADP interfered with the defensive function of microglial cells.

        <tr id="Monitoring the presence and distribution of distinct immune cell populations is key in deciphering immunopathologic disease mechanisms. Considering the crucial role of myeloid cells in provoking hyperinflammatory responses associated with coronavirus disease 2019, a camelid-derived single-domain antibody specifically recognizing human signal-regulatory protein-α (SIRPα) as a biomarker for myeloid cells has been generated and radiolabeled with 64Cu, that is, [64Cu]copper-SIRPα-nanobody ([64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb), for in vivo PET imaging. In this study, this PET tracer was used and validated to monitor the temporal dynamics of inflammatory processes during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nonhuman primates. For further validation, the signal of [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb was compared with the signal of TSPO-targeting [18F]fluorine-N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide ([18F]F-DPA714). Methods: Six cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently monitored for 7 wk. We performed a baseline [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT before infection, followed by repetitive PET/CT on days 3, 10, 24, and 52 after infection covering the head, thorax, and abdominal region. Of the 6 macaques, 3 underwent additional TSPO-targeting [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT investigations at baseline and at days 2, 9, 23, and 51 after infection. Tracheal and nasal swabs were taken to monitor the course of infection, and changes in blood count and inflammatory mediators in the periphery blood were monitored. Results: Detection of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA from tracheal and nasal swab samples confirmed viral infection of all animals. CT scans identified initial pulmonary lesions 2 days after infection. [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT revealed increased tracer uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes of all animals, but not in the lung lesions, 3 days after infection. [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT showed increased uptake in both anatomically affected and unaffected lung tissues. The increased [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake in the spleen and bone marrow of all animals was more pronounced 3 and 7 wk after infection. We detected individual differences in [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake within the bone marrow and spleen, whereas [18F]F-DPA714 exhibited rather homogeneous uptake patterns. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb is a versatile tool for quantitative monitoring of whole-body distribution, temporal distribution, and accumulation dynamics of myeloid cell subpopulations even in moderately inflamed tissues and affected lymphatic organs during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Bacterial pneumonia poses a substantial global health burden, yet the immunological mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis and resolution are incompletely understood.


METHODS
We generated a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood immune cells from 100 individuals: 39 with severe bacterial pneumonia, 31 with mild disease, and 30 healthy controls. Integrating scRNA-seq with clinical and molecular data revealed profound remodeling of the peripheral immune landscape across disease severities.


MAIN RESULTS
Severe pneumonia was characterized by lymphopenia and monocytosis, accompanied by distinct shifts in T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell subset composition. Classical monocytes emerged as central orchestrators of the cytokine storm observed in severe cases, displaying elevated expression of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., S100A8/9/12) and enhanced TLR4-MYD88 signaling. Exhaustion of innate-like CD8+ T cells, marked by upregulation of canonical inhibitory receptors, was a hallmark of severe disease. In contrast, mild pneumonia exhibited robust CD8+ T effector and helper memory cell activation, along with effective humoral immunity, evidenced by plasma cell expansion and coordinated Tfh-B cell interactions. B cells in mild cases showed enhanced antigen recognition, BCR signaling, and co-stimulatory gene expression, whereas those in severe cases displayed signs of dysfunction. Myeloid cell alterations in severe pneumonia included increased monocytic MDSCs and non-classical monocytes, contributing to immunosuppression and complement overactivation, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
This high-resolution atlas of peripheral immune responses in bacterial pneumonia identifies key cellular and molecular drivers of disease severity, providing potential therapeutic targets for immunomodulation and improved outcomes.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections globally, particularly affecting infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. While recent advances in prophylaxis, such as long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal immunization, offer promise for prevention, therapeutic options for active infection remain limited. Severe RSV disease is often driven not solely by viral replication but by dysregulated host immune responses, including excessive cytokine production, T helper type 2 (Th2) and T helper type 17 (Th17) cell polarization, and impaired interferon signaling. RSV has evolved sophisticated immune evasion strategies, such as inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) via nonstructural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1/NS2), and interference with pattern recognition receptor signaling, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. These mechanisms result in attenuated innate immune responses and defective adaptive immunity, contributing to viral persistence, immunopathology, and recurrent infections. Moreover, age-dependent vulnerabilities, such as immune immaturity in infants and immunosenescence in older adults, exacerbate disease severity. Excessive immune activation leads to bronchiolitis, airway remodeling, and long-term sequelae including wheezing and asthma. Emerging immunomodulatory therapies aim to restore immune balance, targeting cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β]), the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, or inflammasome activity. Host-directed therapies and direct-acting antivirals are also under investigation. A better understanding of RSV–host immune interactions is critical for optimizing therapeutic strategies and designing effective vaccines. This review synthesizes current knowledge on RSV immunopathogenesis and highlights immunomodulation as a promising frontier for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="The development of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is characterized by extensive lung inflammation, which, in turn, leads to respiratory distress and a decline in blood oxygen levels. Hospital admission, along with intensive care or ventilator usage, becomes necessary because this condition leads to serious respiratory problems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic methods, and current therapeutic options for pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The pathophysiological process of severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by direct lung damage from viral replication, an excessive immune system response, inflammation, impaired gas exchange, and multi-organ failure. The coexistence of various medical conditions leads to substantial lung impairment, resulting in hypoxia and respiratory failure, which can ultimately lead to fatal outcomes. The diagnosis of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is made through a combination of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings. A multifaceted approach integrating antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, oxygen supplementation, ventilatory management, and immunomodulation is imperative to control inflammation and enhance clinical outcomes. Early intervention, meticulous monitoring, and personalized care are paramount for enhancing survival and mitigating complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.">

        <tr id="COVID affects around 400 million individuals today with a strong economic impact on the global economy. The list of long COVID symptoms is extremely broad because it is derived from neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, and renal dysfunctions and damages. We review here these pathophysiological manifestations and the predictors of this multi-organ pathology like the persistence of the virus, altered endothelial function, unrepaired tissue damage, immune dysregulation, and gut dysbiosis. We also discuss the similarities between long COVID and vaccine side effects together with possible common immuno-inflammatory pathways. Since the spike protein is present in SARS-CoV-2 (and its variants) but also produced by the COVID vaccines, its toxicity may also apply to all mRNA or adenoviral DNA vaccines as they are based on the production of a very similar spike protein to the virus. After COVID infection or vaccination, the spike protein can last for months in the body and may interact with ACE2 receptors and mannan-binding lectin (MBL)/mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (MASP-2), which are present almost everywhere in the organism. As a result, the spike protein may be able to trigger inflammation in a lot of organs and systems similar to COVID infection. We suggest that three immuno-inflammatory pathways are particularly key and responsible for long COVID and COVID vaccine side effects, as it has been shown for COVID, which may explain in large part their strong similarities: the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), the kininogen–kinin–kallikrein system (KKS), and the lectin complement pathway. We propose that therapeutic studies should focus on these pathways to propose better cures for both long COVID as well as for COVID vaccine side effects.">

In this study, spatial transcriptional assays (NanoString CosMx) are utilized to analyze both explant and autopsy samples from non-COVID and COVID-19 lungs, identifying the activation of proinflammatory macrophages in COVID-19 explants. It is further developed immuno-lung organoids comprising hPSC-derived alveolar and airway organoids co-cultured with macrophages to investigate the impact and underlying mechanisms of macrophage-mediated lung damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings demonstrate that proinflammatory macrophages induce lung cell senescence through the THBS1-(ITGA3+ITGB1) signaling axis, a mechanism further validated using spatial transcriptomics. This study not only establishes physiologically relevant immuno-lung organoid models for modeling macrophage-mediated tissue damage, but also identifies a previous unrecognized role of the THBS1-(ITGA3+ITGB1) pathway in driving lung cell senescence during infectious disease.">

        <tr id="Bacterial meningitis is a severe central nervous system infection with incompletely understood pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in blood-brain barrier disruption induced by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). In vitro studies revealed that ExPEC infection upregulated TLR4 expression in human brain microvascular endothelial cells and induced pyroptosis and tight junction protein degradation. TLR4 inhibition by TAK-242 significantly reduced pyroptosis and inflammatory responses but exacerbated tight junction disruption and bacterial invasion. In macrophages, TLR4 inhibition similarly attenuated pyroptosis and inflammatory responses. Interestingly, despite enhanced blood-brain barrier disruption and increased bacterial burden, TLR4-deficient mice showed significantly improved survival. Transcriptome analysis revealed that TLR4 deficiency triggered comprehensive reprogramming of host responses, characterized by both suppressed inflammatory damage and enhanced tissue homeostatic processes. This study demonstrates for the first time that endothelial pyroptosis is a novel mechanism for ExPEC-induced blood-brain barrier disruption and reveals the crucial role of TLR4 in balancing protective and destructive host responses, providing new insights for therapeutic strategies against bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is a growing public health challenge. Neuroinflammation has been proposed as a prominent pathological feature of AD and has traditionally been attributed to the innate immune system. However, emerging evidence highlights the involvement of adaptive immunity, particularly T and B lymphocytes, in the neuroinflammatory processes of AD. It remains unclear how adaptive immune responses, originally intended to protect the body, contribute to chronic inflammation and neuronal dysfunction in AD. Here, we review the roles of adaptive immunity, cellular composition, and niches and their contribution to AD development and progression. Notably, we synthesize the crosstalk between adaptive immunity and the innate immune system of the central nervous system (CNS), which is mainly mediated by glial cells and myeloid cells, and their interrelationships with amyloid-β (Aβ)/Tau pathology. We hypothesized that the alterations observed in innate immunity in AD mirror age-related immune alterations, whereas the dysregulation of adaptive immunity contributes more accurately to disease-specific immune responses. Targeting adaptive immunity in the context of neuroinflammation may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies designed to modulate immune responses, thereby facilitating the diagnosis, intervention, and treatment of AD.">

These disorders involve progressive neuronal loss and cognitive decline, with incompletely elucidated underlying mechanisms. Chronic neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to disease progression. The brain’s resident immune cells, microglia, are central to this inflammatory response. When overactivated, microglia and other immune cells, such as peripheral macrophages, can exacerbate inflammation and accelerate disease development. Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily that demonstrates high expression on microglia in the central nervous system. TREM2 serves a vital role in regulating phagocytosis, synaptic pruning, and energy metabolism. This review examines the functions of TREM2 in neurodegenerative diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target, aiming to inform future treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Tens of thousands of severe COVID-19 cases are hospitalized weekly in the U.S., often driven by an imbalance between antiviral responses and inflammatory signaling, leading to uncontrolled cytokine secretion. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is a known immune antagonist, but its role in macrophage-driven cytokine storms is unclear. We demonstrate that N functions in a pathway-specific manner, specifically amplifying nuclear factor κB-related transcripts upon Toll-like receptor 7/8 stimulation. Moreover, we show that this is a conserved feature of pathogenic coronaviruses, with the delta variant N being the most pro-inflammatory. Our interaction networks suggest the delta variant N drives inflammation through interactions with several stress granule-related proteins. Profiling of secreted cytokines revealed that supernatants from the delta variant N-expressing macrophages disrupt brain and heart endothelial barriers, implicating N in COVID-19-associated cognitive and cardiac complications. Our findings highlight N-mediated immune imbalance as a driver of severe COVID-19 and identify N as a promising therapeutic target to mitigate hyperinflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Persistent symptoms and complications reported by many patients for more than four weeks after contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome. These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability. Methods In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level of p < 0.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software. Results Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has triggered a global health crisis, with over 700 million confirmed cases and at least 7 million deaths reported by early 2024. Children are less vulnerable to severe SARS‐CoV‐2 infection than adults and typically experience milder respiratory symptoms. However, a rare but significant complication, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS‐C), can develop weeks after infection, characterized by a spectrum of inflammatory symptoms. This study employed whole‐exome sequencing and over‐representation analysis to identify genetic variants of potential clinical significance related to MIS‐C or severe COVID‐19 in a group of children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), all of whom were unvaccinated for COVID‐19. We observed the enrichment of potentially pathogenic genetic variants in genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, particularly glycogen breakdown, in severe COVID‐19 pediatric patients, and in genes related to cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in MIS‐C patients. These findings offer insights into the genetic underpinnings of MIS‐C and severe COVID‐19, suggesting potential genes and biological pathways for further research.">

        <tr id="Background: This study aimed to analyze metabolic changes in blood samples from patients with confirmed COVID-19 to explore the correlation between metabolomics and cytokines in survivors and non-survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the complex biochemical and immunometabolic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for elucidating the pathophysiology and virulence of COVID-19. Methods: This study included 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 40 healthy controls. Serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS), and cytokine levels were measured using ELISA. Results: Our study defined three clear metabolic phenotypes among survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19 compared with healthy controls, which might be related to mortality, severity, and disease burden. A strong relationship was observed between certain inflammatory markers, including IL-1β, IL-2, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-17, and GM-CSF, as well as several metabolites, particularly in COVID-19 non-survivors, such as LysoPCs, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and serotonin. Different metabolite-cytokine correlation patterns were observed according to patient outcomes, indicating unique correlations between metabolic and immune responses in survivors and non-survivors. Metabolic phenotypes were associated with clinical outcomes, comorbidities, and sex-related differences. Kynurenine and related metabolites of tryptophan metabolism were closely correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and mortality. Compared with survivors and healthy controls, non-survivors displayed higher IL-6, together with distinct metabolic changes. These included increased kynurenine through the IDO1 pathway, elevated glucose and lactate reflecting hyperglycolysis and energy stress, and higher xanthosine from purine turnover. Stronger cytokine–metabolite correlations in this group point to tightly linked immunometabolic activation. Conclusions: Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct metabolic phenotypes that could be associated with the severity and inflammation levels of COVID-19. Correlation analysis between metabolites and cytokines demonstrated strong intercorrelations between specific metabolites and cytokines, indicating a strong interrelationship between inflammatory markers and metabolic alterations. Specific metabolic pathways associated with cytokines and their clinical relevance may serve as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease and the quality of life of patients co-infected with COVID-19 and TB is significantly impacted due to the nature of these diseases. It is still unknown how our immune system will respond to both these pathogens in sequel. As it has been discovered that Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) result in caseating granulomas in TB and pathology in COVID-19, we conducted this work to determine the amounts of NET molecules in the bloodstream and to comprehend their function during TB and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We recruited 43 healthy volunteers, 40 newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody and 18 newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Results Although Citrullinated Histone H3 and myeloperoxidase, did not show any difference in their levels, the NET marker elastase had significantly reduced circulatory levels in the tuberculosis group with SARS-CoV IgG positivity compared to tuberculosis group without SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity. Discussion The substantial decrease in elastase levels observed in the diabetic cohort of TB patients with SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity is intriguing and needs large cohort studies in the future to understand the influence of diabetes in TB patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="High-altitude cognitive impairment (HACI) results from acute or chronic exposure to hypoxic conditions. Brain lipid homeostasis is crucial for cognitive function, and lipid droplet (LD) accumulation in glia cells is linked to cognitive decline in aging and stroke. However, whether high-altitude exposure affects brain lipid homeostasis is unclear. Microglia, key regulators of brain homeostasis and inflammation, play a significant role in pathological cognitive impairment and are implicated in LD formation. This study investigates whether lipid dysregulation contributes to HACI and explores microglia-driven mechanisms and potential interventions. Mice were exposed to a simulated 7000 m altitude for 48 h, followed by a week of recovery. Cognitive function and LD accumulation in brain cells were assessed. Microglia were depleted using PLX5622, and mice were exposed to hypoxia or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to validate microglia’s role in driving astrocytic LD accumulation and cognitive decline. Minocycline was used to inhibit inflammation. In vitro, co-culture systems of microglia and astrocytes were employed to confirm microglia-derived pro-inflammatory factors’ role in astrocytic LD accumulation. Hypobaric hypoxia exposure induced persistent cognitive impairment and LD accumulation in hippocampal astrocytes and microglia. Microglia depletion alleviated cognitive deficits and reduced astrocytic LD accumulation. Hypoxia or LPS did not directly cause LD accumulation in astrocytes but activated microglia to release IL-1β, inducing astrocytic LD accumulation. Microglia depletion also mitigated LPS-induced cognitive impairment and astrocytic LD accumulation. Minocycline reduced hypoxia-induced LD accumulation in co-cultured astrocytes and improved cognitive function. Hypoxia triggers pro-inflammatory microglial activation, leading to LD accumulation and the release of IL-1β, which drives astrocytic LD accumulation and neuroinflammation, exacerbating HACI. Minocycline effectively restores brain lipid homeostasis and mitigates cognitive impairment. This study provides novel insights into HACI mechanisms and suggests potential therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Intercellular communication in the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for maintaining neural function and coordinating responses to injury or disease. With recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, a growing body of research has revealed that this communication is highly dynamic, shifting across states of health, aging, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. In this review, we synthesize the current findings on intercellular communication networks involving neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and other glial populations in the CNS across four major states: healthy homeostasis, aging, demyelinating diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We focus on how changes in intercellular communication contribute to the maintenance or disruption of CNS integrity and function. Mechanistic insights into these signaling networks have revealed new molecular targets and pathways that may be exploited for therapeutic intervention. By comparing the intercellular signaling mechanisms across different disease contexts, we underscore the importance of CNS crosstalk not only as a hallmark of disease progression, but also as a potential gateway for precision therapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background In cardiac arrest (CA) patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), neuroinflammation following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) contributes to brain ischemia/reperfusion injury and neurological dysfunction. Recent evidence suggested that neuraminidase could exacerbate inflammatory responses by disrupting CD24‐Siglec‐G/10 immune checkpoint axis. As a neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir phosphate (OP) holds potential for immunomodulation beyond its antiviral use. We aimed to investigate the impact and mechanism of OP on neuroinflammation regulation after ROSC. Methods Male pigs were randomized into the sham control group, CPR, and CPR + OP group. CA was induced in pigs through 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation. Brains were harvested for assessing serum inflammatory markers and neuronal damage at 24 h after ROSC. BV2 microglial underwent oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Effects of OP on inflammatory responses, NF‐κB activation, cell viability, and the CD24‐Siglec‐G/10 interaction were evaluated using immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, molecular, and biochemical assays. Results In vivo, OP attenuated pig cerebral microglial activation and neuronal integrity with attenuated neuroinflammation, alongside time‐dependent neuraminidase activity increases. In vitro, OP suppressed OGD/R‐induced microglial NF‐κB activation, reduced pro‐inflammatory cytokine levels, and preserved CD24‐Siglec‐G interaction, correlating with diminished neuraminidase release. Conclusions OP as a repurposed immunomodulator that suppresses microglial‐driven neuroinflammation after CA by preserving sialylation‐dependent CD24‐Siglec‐G/10 interaction.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has affected at least 989 dairy herds across 17 states in the United States (U.S.) and resulted in 70 confirmed human infections, underscoring the urgent need to understand the pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions of emerging H5N1 viruses. In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially severe systemic inflammatory condition triggered by various immunomodulatory therapies, making understanding its pathogenesis critical for improving patient outcomes. Results/Methods By combining immunotoxicology and systems biology approaches, we offer a novel and integrative conceptual model of CRS as an adverse outcome (AO), induced by five different immunomodulatory biotherapies: 1) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, 2) checkpoint inhibitors, 3) T cell engaging bispecific modalities, 4) monoclonal antibodies targeting and activating T cell receptors, and 5) FcγR activating monoclonal antibodies. This model uniquely integrates multiple CRS-inducing therapies into a unified framework, offering a comprehensive mechanistic representation of CRS pathophysiology. For that, we built an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) CRS network for these therapies and then developed a systems biology map of molecular mechanisms relevant to the AOP network. The map of mechanisms is made available via a dedicated online platform for exploration and data visualisation. It includes 24 cell types, 425 entities and 430 interactions. Discussion Beyond a static representation, the CRS Map serves as a dynamic tool for clinical and research applications, allowing researchers and clinicians to explore CRS progression in detail, identify biomarkers, and discover potential therapeutic targets. The map demonstrates stages of CRS progression and shows molecules that can be measured in relevant immunotoxicological assays, as well as potential drug targets for therapeutic intervention of CRS.">

        <tr id="Influenza causes 3–5 million severe cases globally each year, with severe viral pneumonia often requiring hospitalization for over four weeks. While the inflammatory response to influenza infection helps control viral replication, excessive inflammation is a key driver of disease severity and mortality. Excessive pulmonary lymphocytes, particularly IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes, contribute significantly to pulmonary inflammation at the late-stage of H1N1 viral infection. Cyclosporin A, a potent T-cell inhibitor, mitigates influenza A virus-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. However, the therapeutic role of lymphocyte suppression in cyclosporin A-mediated attenuation of H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the viral titer was 0 in all the homogenized lung tissues of mice on Day-21 post a sublethal H1N1 viral infection. H1N1 viral infection caused worsened general condition and pulmonary inflammation with the infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils on Day-21 post-infection. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of H1N1 virus-infected mice showed a 16-fold higher lymphocyte count compared to neutrophils. H1N1 viral infection significantly elevated both IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations and IFN-γ levels in mouse lungs. H1N1 viral infection additionally expanded IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations in both spleen and peripheral blood. Cyclosporin A treatment significantly mitigated H1N1 viral infection-induced worsened general condition, pulmonary lymphocytic inflammation, increases of pulmonary IFN-γ concentrations and IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes in the lung, spleen and blood of mice on Day-21 post-infection. Together, lymphocytes may contribute significantly to H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation. Cyclosporin A may alleviate H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation through decreasing IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes.

        <tr id="Goal The present study intended to evaluate whether the profile of soluble immune mediators observed in cord blood samples resembles the pattern identified for mother serum samples. Methods For this purpose, parallel analysis of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors was carried out in mother–newborn paired samples from acute and convalescent COVID-19 subgroups (Early, Intermediate, and Late) as well as healthy controls (HC). Results Data demonstrated that increased levels of CCL11, IFN-γ, IL1-Ra, and G-CSF were observed in cord blood samples from most COVID-19 subgroups, with fold change magnitude from 1.6× to 8.2× as compared with HC. Comparative analysis of mother–newborn pairs demonstrated that several immune mediators (CCL11, CCL4, IFN-γ, PDFG, and G-CSF) exhibited high increment magnitude in cord blood as compared with mother serum, reaching values up to 15.7×, mainly at convalescent COVID-19 infection. The signatures of soluble immune mediators revealed distinct waveforms for cord blood and mother serum, with a waning of immune mediators in the latter, contrasting with the increasing set of molecules in the former from acute toward convalescent COVID-19. Integrative network analysis of immune mediators in mother–newborn pairs showed an increase of neighborhood connectivity both in microenvironments and in their interplay from acute toward late convalescent COVID-19. Our results support the hypothesis of the interplay between mother serum and cord blood microenvironment that may impact the fetus development. Conclusion Together, this evidence regarding the maternal–fetal crosstalk can ultimately subsidize the improvement of clinical practice and public health policies for management of prenatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Sepsis, a condition characterized by immune dysregulation, is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality and requires rapid treatment. Assessing immune dysregulation has been challenging. The IntelliSep Index (ISI), a novel biomarker which leverages microfluidic deformability cytometry to assess immune activation, has been evaluated as a test for Emergency Department use but it is unclear how the signal evolves as patient condition evolves. In a 47-patient cohort with hospital stays ≤ 14 days, ISI provided a good indicator of disease progression by blinded physician review. ISI trends correlated with clinical improvement over time. During the first 12 h following presentation, ISI was unaffected by antibiotic treatment initiated in the emergency department (ED). After this period however, ISI values declined, reflecting the patient’s response to treatment, with Band 3 patients showing a 20% decline within the first two days of admission. ISI trends preceded Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score changes by two days. ISI also provided more stable and timely disease state assessments compared to traditional biomarkers (PCT, CRP, IL-6, and neutrophil elastase). Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and assess ISI’s clinical utility as a prognosticator of sepsis progression and treatment response.

        <tr id="Pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a self-limiting disease. Its progression and prognosis are highly heterogeneous among people of different ages, genders, and living with different life styles. Such heterogeneity also exists in treatment outcomes of different patients. Various physiological and pathological factors, such as renewal of pulmonary cell, number of entry receptor and viral replication, have been identified linking to the development of the disease. However, it is still unclear how these factors collectively establish a causal relationship in the course of disease progression. In this study, we built a mechanistic model to explain the dynamics of infection and progression of COVID-19. We modeled how the interaction of pulmonary cells determine the dynamics of disease progression by characterizing the temporal dynamics of viral load, infected and health alveolar cells, and dysfunctional alveolar cells. The viral and cellular dynamics captured different stages of clinical manifestations in individual patient during disease progression: the incubation period, mild symptom period, and severe period. We further simulated clinical interference at different stages of disease progression. The results showed that some medical interventions show no improvement either in reducing the recovery rate or shortening the recovery time. Our theoretical framework may provide a mechanistic explanation at the systems level for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 as well as other similar respiratory tract diseases.">

One widely discussed aspect of these vaccines is their uniquely broad spectrum and increased incidence of adverse events (AEs), collectively referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). Although the reported PVS rate is low, the high number of administered doses among healthy individuals has resulted in a substantial number of reported vaccine-related injuries. A prominent manifestation of PVS is multisystem inflammation, hypothesized to result from the systemic transfection of organ cells with genetic instructions for a toxin, the spike protein, delivered with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). In this narrative review, we focus on endothelial cells in the microcirculatory networks of various organs as primary sites of transfection with mRNA-LNP and consequent PVS. We outline the anatomical variations in the microcirculation contributing to the individual variability of symptoms and examine the molecular and cellular responses to vaccine nanoparticle exposure at the endothelial cell level with a focus on the pathways of a sustained cascade of toxic and autoimmune processes. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying mRNA-LNP-induced AEs and PVS at the organ and cellular levels is critical for improving the safety of future vaccines and other therapeutic applications of this groundbreaking technology.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes cardiovascular complications, which contributes to the high mortality rate of the disease. Emerging evidence indicates that aberrant vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) function is a key driver of vascular disease in COVID-19. While antivirals alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19, it is not known whether these drugs directly affect SMCs. Accordingly, the present study investigated the ability of three approved COVID-19 antiviral drugs to influence SMC function. Treatment of SMCs with remdesivir (RDV), but not molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir, inhibited cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and migration without affecting cell viability. RDV also stimulated an increase in heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression that was not observed with molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir. The induction of HO-1 by RDV was abolished by mutating the antioxidant responsive element of the promoter, overexpressing dominant-negative NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), or treating cells with an antioxidant. Finally, silencing HO-1 partly rescued the proliferative and migratory response of RDV-treated SMCs, and this was reversed by carbon monoxide and bilirubin. In conclusion, the induction of HO-1 via the oxidant-sensitive Nrf2 signaling pathway contributes to the antiproliferative and antimigratory actions of RDV by generating carbon monoxide and bilirubin. These pleiotropic actions of RDV may prevent occlusive vascular disease in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astrocytes play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis and function in the central nervous system, including their involvement in reparative processes. Here, we examined how a common mutation in the homeostatic iron regulatory gene, H67D HFE, impacts the antioxidant mechanism of astrocytes and migration under normal and reparative conditions. Previous data from our group suggested that this mutation may modify disease progression through an antioxidant mechanism involving nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and ferritin. In this study, we used primary murine astrocytes with either the H67D or wild‐type HFE genotype to determine whether astrocytes contribute to the antioxidant protective mechanism previously observed. We analyzed their antioxidant profile and migration both at baseline and after a scratch wound injury. We found that H67D HFE astrocytes expressed the HFE protein and exhibited an enhanced antioxidant profile, marked by increased glutathione and GPX4 at baseline, and a reduced migration length into three‐dimensional granular hydrogel scaffolds. However, following scratch wound injury, these astrocytes exhibited a shift in migratory behavior, leading to faster wound infiltration. Moreover, their antioxidant response became even more pronounced after injury, with increased expression of Nrf2, GPX4, and H‐ferritin (FTH1). These results suggest that the mechanism underlying HFE mutation neuroprotection in disease processes involves an antioxidant profile in astrocytes, which is increased upon insult to activate the astrocytic reparative mechanism.">

        <tr id="Current pharmacological treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) predominantly employs dopaminergic agents aimed at enhancing cerebral dopamine levels. While these therapeutic strategies provide symptomatic relief, their palliative nature is frequently associated with dose-dependent complications, including gastrointestinal disturbances, emetic symptoms, and motor complications such as dyskinesia. Moreover, the honeymoon period of drugs has greatly limited their clinical application. The multifactorial etiology of PD continues to challenge researchers, yet substantial evidence implicates α-synuclein as a critical pathogenic mediator. Emerging findings suggest that dysregulated neuroimmune interactions constitute a fundamental mechanism in PD progression, where chronic immune activation appears particularly detrimental to neuronal survival. Notably, neuroinflammatory cascades coupled with compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity create a self-perpetuating cycle of neural degeneration, wherein α-synuclein-specific T cells exacerbate disease pathology while regulatory T cell populations demonstrate potential immunomodulatory capacities. This review systematically examines the mechanistic interplay involving neuroinflammatory cascades, BBB compromise, central nervous system (CNS) immunoregulation, and T lymphocyte subpopulations (including regulatory T cells) in the pathogenesis of PD. By synthesizing current evidence, we aim to establish a conceptual framework supporting the investigation of cellular immunity-based therapies for PD.">

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce the severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to prolonged phenotypic and functional changes. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic‐activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN), while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT‐I cell proliferation after antigen presentation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days after RSV infection, especially impacting genes associated with MHC. Lasting upregulation of MHC‐I and MHC‐II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that RSV can induce prolonged upregulation of antigen presentation by LECs, with the potential to facilitate local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens and to enhance immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a life-threatening syndrome involving dysfunction of multiple immune cell types.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to comprehensively depict the dynamic trajectory of immune responses throughout the disease course of HBV-related ACLF (HBV-ACLF).


DESIGN
Single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell proteomics were performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 45 samples from 17 patients who were hospitalised (progressive/stable/recovering course of HBV-ACLF, 6/5/6) and 15 control subjects (liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and healthy controls, 5/5/5). Functional and mechanistic experiments were validated in vivo and in vitro.


RESULTS
Single-cell multiomics analysis revealed specific changes in the peripheral immune response in ACLF. VCAN+CD14+-monocytes with activated interferon-stimulated genes and enhanced inflammatory functions, stimulated by HBV relapse and expanded in ACLF-1, fuelling early inflammatory storm. The subsequent apoptotic hepatocytes predominantly induce hyperinflammatory C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2)+-neutrophils and CD163+-monocytes, enriching in patients with progressive ACLF and serving as significant markers of disease deterioration. Cytotoxic T-cells were functionally impaired and significantly decreased in progressive patients. CXCR2+-neutrophils exhibited immunosuppressive activity and induced the exhaustion of cytotoxic T-cells. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 significantly reduced neutrophils infiltration, restored cytotoxic T-cells and showed therapeutic effect in ACLF mice. Six immune cellular modules (CMs) were identified for patient stratification, with CM2 and CM6 showing strong predictive value for disease outcomes, and CM3 indicating a potential early therapeutic window.


CONCLUSION
Our longitudinal multiomics study revealed the dynamic evolution of the immune response in HBV-ACLF and characterised diverse immune patterns for the future precise management and therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="The three pathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) are inflammation, demyelination, and progressive neurodegeneration. None of the approved disease-modifying therapies for MS counters all three pathologies, and, more specifically, none is approved for neuroprotection. Axonal loss is the most significant contributor to chronic and irreversible disability in MS. A tantalizing molecular target has emerged to uniquely counter all three MS pathologies: tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2). Agonism or activation of TNFR2 has been shown in MS models to induce immunosuppression, oligodendrocyte precursor differentiation, and neuroprotection. Further, in basic science studies stemming from the past 15 years, TNFR2 agonism is known to be a strong inducer of T-regulatory cells (Tregs). Treg cells, and especially those expressing TNFR2, are known to confer the strongest suppression per cell type. TNFR2 is even more attractive as a therapeutic target because of its restricted expression by only a handful of CNS and immune cell subsets, thereby minimizing the likelihood of systemic and other adverse effects. Recent antibody design work suggests many of the hurdles of Treg agonism may have been overcome. This review covers the current treatment landscape for MS, the basic science of TNFR2, the rationale for and evidence behind TNFR2 agonism to treat multiple sclerosis, the design of potent TNFR2 agonist antibodies, and the treatment applications for other neurological, autoimmune, or inflammatory diseases.">

Beyond respiratory complications, the disease involves systemic manifestations driven by immune dysregulation, inflammation, and coagulopathy. Among the many mechanisms implicated in severe disease, a growing body of evidence suggests a central role for the imbalance between proteases and antiproteases. This review examines how dysregulated protease activity contributes to viral entry, cytokine activation, vascular injury, and thrombosis. We focus on the integration of proteolytic systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, coagulation cascade, and neutrophil extracellular traps with established pathways like endothelial dysfunction and immune hyperactivation. Furthermore, we highlight therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring proteolytic balance and discuss the potential relevance of this paradigm in the management of long COVID.">

We discuss how these molecules orchestrate the migration of peripheral leukocytes into the brain parenchyma and how neurotropic flaviviruses induce this process. Moreover, we discuss evidence of leukocytes both controlling viral propagation and contributing to neuropathology, which poses a challenge for therapy development.

We previously reported long‐lasting generalized CD8 T cell hyperfunction in chronic HCV infection with advanced fibrosis, yet its separation from viral and fibrosis‐driven effects, as well as clinical outcomes of advanced fibrosis, remains unclear. In a murine model of carbon tetrachloride‐induced progressive liver fibrosis, advanced fibrosis was observed by 12 weeks, with pathologies similar to those of human chronic HCV infection. Blood‐circulating CD8 T cells showed IFN‐γ and granzyme B (GrB) hyperfunction in response to anti‐CD3/28 stimulation, as well as impaired responses to ectopic tumour challenge and anti‐PD‐1/CTLA‐4 immunotherapy. Hyperfunction and impaired tumour responses were retained despite liver insult cessation. In a 45% HFD model, which induced steatosis and minimal fibrosis, IFN‐γ and GrB hyperfunction was also observed in blood‐circulating CD8 T cells. This study highlights a prolonged systemic CD8 T cell dysfunction acquired during progressive liver disease, associated with impaired antitumour and immunotherapy responses. These mirror the bulk CD8 T cell dysfunction observed in advanced liver diseases in humans, suggesting that these models could be valuable for future mechanistic studies aimed at identifying targets to help improve clinical outcomes in chronic liver disease.">

        <tr id="Targeting cell death pathways, including pyroptosis and necroptosis, has been shown to mitigate influenza virus infection severity. Here, we examined whether pyroptosis specifically driven by the pore-forming protein gasdermin E (GSDME) is involved in regulating influenza virus infection outcomes. We found that Gsdme−/− mice showed similar weight loss and survival in severe A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus infections compared to WT counterparts. Likewise, lung dysfunction, histopathological damage, viral titers, and inflammatory cytokine levels were similar in the two groups. Global transcriptomic analysis also revealed similar inflammatory and antiviral gene expression programs in WT versus Gsdme−/− mouse lungs at baseline and in response to infection. To confirm the generality of these findings, we infected mice with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and again observed similar weight loss, mortality, and lung dysfunction in WT and Gsdme−/− mice. Our results overall demonstrate that GSDME contributes negligibly to the host response against H1N1 influenza virus, refining our understanding of cell death pathways in influenza pathogenesis.">

SOCS proteins inhibit cytokine signaling through various mechanisms, such as blocking STAT binding to JAKs and targeting proteins for ubiquitination and degradation. While these proteins maintain immune balance by suppressing excessive inflammatory responses, many viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2, exploit SOCS proteins to evade host immunity. In consequence, understanding their modulatory functions in viral disease has become increasingly relevant.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation and neurovascular dysfunction are two major pathologies in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet their interplay remains poorly understood. Astrocytes are central players in both brain immunity and neurovascular coupling. In this study, we induced neuroinflammation through systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in 12-month-old APP/PS1dE9 mice and simultaneously monitored the astrocyte Ca2+ signaling and the brain hemodynamics with two-photon microscopy. We showed that the spontaneous release of Ca2+ in astrocytes was elevated in AD mice and decreased by 14 days of LPS administration. The effects of LPS-induced inflammation on astrocytic Ca2+ signaling varied substantially between brief 3 sensory stimulation and sustained 30 second sensory stimulation with modest effects on vascular responses. These findings highlight the nuanced impact of neuroinflammation on astrocytic Ca2+ dynamics and brain hemodynamics in AD, shedding light on mechanisms that link these pathologies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe fungal disease caused by Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) that may spread hematogenously to extrapulmonary organs. IPA is typically associated with a broad spectrum of immunocompromised conditions and constitutes a high mortality rate. While the association of influenza as a risk for secondary bacterial infections is well appreciated, emerging evidence indicates that influenza-hospitalized patients demonstrate increased susceptibility to severe aspergillosis infection. In this study, we developed a murine Influenza A Virus (IAV)-Af co-infection model and investigated the role of IAV host response in promoting invasive Af infection. Our data show that IAV temporarily suppresses neutrophil recruitment in the early phase of Af co-infection (24 hours), followed by a subsequent increase in neutrophil levels (48 hours). RNA sequencing analysis of neutrophils from IAV-Af co-infected lungs (48 hours) reveals enrichment of pathways regulating inflammatory responses and phagocytosis. Despite higher inflammatory response and phagocytosis, the host response from IAV-Af co-infected lungs had suppressive effects on neutrophil conidial killing, correlating with lung fungal load and invasion. However, the increased fungal invasion observed at 24 hours post co-infection, despite similar fungal loads in both groups (Af vs. IAV-Af), suggests that IAV-induced pathologic lung inflammation and vascular damage likely promote Af invasiveness during the initial phase of co-infection, and subsequently, the defects in neutrophil fungicidal response and exacerbated lung damage lead to sustained and fatal IPA pathogenesis in the later phase of co-infection.">

This review summarizes the current research on LLMs, focusing on disease-specific regulators and functions, protective roles, interactions with neighboring cells, and advances in diagnostic and analytical tools. We also discuss the blurred distinction between LLMs and macrophages, inconsistent terminology, and major knowledge gaps across different disease contexts. Deciphering the composition, formation, and dynamics of lipid droplets in microglia is critical for uncovering how microglial states shift under diverse pathological stimuli. A clearer view of these mechanisms may reveal novel roles of LLMs and open new avenues for therapeutic intervention.">

BACKGROUND

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with an overactive immune response, contributing to disease severity. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays a central role in mediating inflammatory responses during viral infections, including COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES

This computational reanalysis explores the critical involvement of NF-κB signaling, particularly through toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and noncanonical pathways, in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, immune activation, and cytokine storm. We also discuss the crosstalk between NF-κB and other signaling pathways in the context of COVID-19, and summarize current and potential therapeutic strategies targeting NF-κB.

METHODS

An extensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, TLR signaling, NF-κB pathway activation, noncanonical NF-κB signaling, and anti-inflammatory drug interventions were analyzed and synthesized.

RESULTS

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, often facilitated by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease activity. This viral entry triggers downstream immune signaling cascades, especially through TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8. TLR engagement activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. NF-κB signaling exhibits extensive crosstalk with other pathways, including Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome (NLRP3) activation, contributing to cytokine storm and lung injury. Several pharmacological agents, including corticosteroids, Inhibitor of κB Kinase ( IKK) inhibitors, and repurposed drugs like dexamethasone and resveratrol, show potential in mitigating NF-κB-mediated inflammation.

CONCLUSION

NF-κB signaling serves as a pivotal mediator of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and immune dysregulation. Targeting this pathway—particularly its noncanonical branches and TLR-mediated activation—offers promising therapeutic avenues. Understanding NF-κB crosstalk with other immune pathways may yield synergistic drug targets to improve COVID-19 outcomes.">

The underlying cause of EV-D68–induced AFM is contentious; whether spinal cord motor neurons are damaged by direct viral infection, infiltration of immune cells, or a combination of both is not clear. In this issue of the JCI, Woods Acevedo and coworkers used a neonatal WT mouse model of EV-D68 infection to attribute paralytic disease to immune cell infiltration into the spinal cord. The results of their work in cytokine-knockout or immune cell–depleted animals effectively argue that immunopathogenesis plays an integral role in EV-D68–induced AFM.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a dynamic, context-sensitive process that plays essential roles in brain development, maintenance, and response to injury. It reflects a finely balanced neuroimmune state—facilitating repair and adaptation under homeostatic conditions, while also contributing to dysfunction when dysregulated or chronically activated. In this mini-review, we examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammatory responses, focusing on the roles of microglia and astrocytes, their bidirectional communication with neurons, and their interaction with peripheral immune signals. We describe how various stimuli—including aging, protein aggregates, and cellular stress—modulate glial function and shift immune activity toward protective or deleterious outcomes. Special attention is given to endogenous regulatory pathways, including cytokine signaling, receptor-mediated crosstalk, and immunometabolic cues that determine the resolution or persistence of inflammation. We further discuss shared and disease-specific features of neuroinflammation across neurological disorders, offering a systems-level perspective on how immune activity contributes to neural resilience or degeneration. This integrated view aims to inform future studies on neuroimmune dynamics in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation, meaning an inflammatory process primarily occurring within the central nervous system (CNS), is thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (SC), although existing evidence is sometimes contradictory. This review critically summarizes the existing data on neuroinflammation and possible neuroinflammatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of SC. Despite heterogeneity and inconsistency, the existing evidence indicates dysregulation of inflammatory genes and infiltration of the CNS parenchyma by immune cells, disturbances in the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and blood-brain barrier, and activation of microglia and astroglia. Widely documented increases in levels of peripheral inflammatory biomarkers also reflect activation of inflammatory processes in the CNS. Nevertheless, patients differ in the degree of activation of neuroinflammatory processes, indicating the existence of immunophenotypes of SC with and without neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation may be associated with dysregulation of synaptic pruning, impaired neuroplasticity, glymphatic-clearance dysfunction, and white-matter pathology, all of which may ultimately lead to functional brain dysconnectivity and disease manifestation. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and gut-brain axis and disturbances in the kynurenine pathway are the main molecular mechanisms linking peripheral and central inflammation. However, neuroinflammation may not only be associated with negative consequences but also indicate activation of adaptive and reparative processes. Thus, neuroinflammation may be entwined in the pathogenetic mechanisms of SC; therefore, anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies may improve patient care.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Ischemic stroke frequently leads to white matter injury (WMI), significantly impairing neurological function and recovery. Microglia, the central nervous system's resident immune cells, play a dual role in poststroke pathology and repair. Their diverse activation states and interactions with other glial cells influence demyelination, remyelination, and overall WMI outcomes. To systematically review and synthesize the current evidence regarding the temporal and functional dynamics of microglia in ischemic stroke, with a focus on their roles in white matter damage and recovery. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases (through December 2024) with keywords including “ischemic stroke,” “white matter injury,” “microglia,” “myelin,” and “oligodendrocytes.” Studies involving mechanistic insights into microglial polarization, myelin repair, and associated molecular pathways were prioritized. Both preclinical and clinical studies were reviewed. Results Microglia exhibit distinct activation profiles in acute and chronic phases poststroke. Pro‐inflammatory microglia exacerbate WMI via cytokine secretion and oligodendrocyte toxicity, while immune‐regulatory microglia promote remyelination through trophic support and debris clearance. Key regulatory pathways include TREM2, CX3CR1, and purinergic signaling. Microglial phagocytosis, cytokine production, and interactions with astrocytes critically modulate remyelination. Therapeutic modulation of microglial phenotype (e.g., fingolimod, HDAC inhibitors) shows promise in enhancing white matter repair. Conclusion Microglia exert time‐ and region‐specific effects on WMI after ischemic stroke. A nuanced understanding of their dynamic phenotypes and interactions with other glial elements is essential for developing targeted therapies. Future research should integrate single‐cell technologies, human validation, and sex‐specific analyses to refine microglia‐based interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract INTRODUCTION Growing evidence links gut microbiota (GM) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, a Gram‐negative bacteria component, are found in AD brains, but how LPS breaches the blood–brain barrier (BBB) remains unclear. Hypotheses suggest that bacteria‐derived extracellular vesicles (bEVs) may transport LPS across the BBB. METHODS bEVs were extracted from human and mouse feces and blood, and LPS levels were measured. In vivo imaging and immunofluorescence confirmed the transport of blood LPS‐carrying bEVs across the BBB. The role of these bEVs in microglia was investigated both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS Elevated LPS‐containing bEVs were detected in the plasma of AD patients compared to healthy individuals. These bEVs activated microglial Piezo1, consequently precipitating an excessive synaptic pruning process mediated by the C1q‐C3 complement pathway. DISCUSSION These findings illuminate the complex interplay between the gut microbiota, bEVs, neuroinflammation, and synaptic plasticity – a key early event in AD – offering insights for potential therapeutic interventions. Highlights GM‐derived bEVs can traverse the BBB. LPS was necessary for bEVs’ penetration into the brain, and bEVs might be closely related to AD progression. bEVs mediated microglial activation and synaptic pruning via C1q‐C3 complement pathway.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aging is a complex biological process that significantly impacts the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes, critical support cells in the brain, undergo senescence with age, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases. While previous studies have utilized murine models to investigate astrocyte senescence, human astrocytes offer a more physiologically relevant system to study age‐related neurodegenerative changes. This study presents a novel protocol for inducing senescence in both human primary and murine astrocytes using a combination of cellular stressors, such as lactacystin, H2O2, rotenone, and doxorubicin. Our results demonstrate that doxorubicin treatment effectively induces a robust senescent phenotype in both human and murine astrocytes, characterized by increased expression of senescence markers such as p21 and β‐galactosidase, along with activation of the DNA damage response (γ‐H2AX and 53BP1). Doxorubicin treatment increased nuclear size and induced cell cycle arrest in astrocytes, as revealed by reduced BrdU incorporation and decreased cell density, without inducing cytotoxic effects. This phenotype is accompanied by a pronounced pro‐inflammatory profile, with elevated expression of cytokines including MMP3, IL‐6, and IL‐1β, indicative of a strong senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These findings provide a novel in vitro model for murine and human astrocyte senescence induced by doxorubicin, highlighting its relevance for studying mechanisms underlying age‐related neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. By establishing a robust model of human astrocyte senescence, this study provides a valuable tool for exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving age‐related neurodegenerative processes, serving as an alternative approach to traditional murine models.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition that begins when the body’s immune system mistakenly destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This review examines the potential role of common viral infections in triggering or accelerating this autoimmune response. Key findings include that enteroviruses, especially Coxsackie B viruses, show the strongest association with new-onset type 1 diabetes. Other viruses—including mumps, rubella, rotavirus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2—have also been linked, though less consistently. Interestingly, some infections, such as cytomegalovirus or chickenpox, may even delay disease onset. Viruses may influence disease development by directly damaging pancreatic beta cells or by triggering immune confusion through molecular mimicry, where viral proteins resemble human ones. While no single virus is definitively proven to cause the disease, infections appear to accelerate or precipitate diabetes in genetically at-risk individuals. Understanding these interactions could support vaccine development, antiviral therapies, and early screening programs. Such approaches may help reduce the incidence or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes and its burden on individuals and healthcare systems.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Clinical studies have reported the association between depression and inflammation. Rodent studies have demonstrated that chronic stress activates microglia, leading to neuronal dysfunctions and depression-related behaviors via proinflammatory molecules. However, since previous studies have relied on a limited number of microglial activation markers, the entire view of stress-induced microglial response remains elusive. Thus, essential questions, such as how differently microglia respond to acute and chronic stress, how differently microglia respond to stress among individuals, and what determines these properties of microglial responses, are also unanswered. Aims & Objectives Using a rodent model of social defeat stress, combined with multiomics analyses and genetic manipulations, we investigated the specific characteristics of stress that drive microglial responses, their molecular mechanisms, and their impact on behavior. Method We subjected male C57BL/6N mice to acute or chronic social defeat stress. We categorized the mice after chronic social defeat stress into susceptible and resilient mice according to the level of social avoidance, a typical depression-related behavior. Then, we isolated microglia from multiple brain areas of these mice, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), primary sensory and motor cortices, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and hypothalamus, and subjected these cells to single-cell RNA-seq. In addition, we more deeply analyzed the transcriptome of microglia from the mPFC and NAc, two representative brain areas with distinct responses to social defeat stress, with bulk RNA seq. We then predicted transcription factors responsible for stress-induced changes in the microglial transcriptome and examined their functional significance using genetic and surgical manipulations. Results Single-cell RNA-seq revealed that acute stress altered microglial transcriptome in all the examined brain regions. The microglial transcriptome was further changed with chronic stress in susceptible mice but returned to the original state in resilient mice. Microglial transcriptome also varied among brain regions and even more after stress. Thus, microglial transcriptome manifested chronic stress selectivity, stress susceptibility selectivity, and brain region selectivity. Clustering analysis revealed that gene expressions selective to chronic stress and those selective to stress susceptibility were mostly segregated and that brain region selectivity emerged within the former gene expressions. Nonetheless, these selectivities coincided in the same microglial clusters. Bulk RNA-seq analysis of mPFC and NAc microglia reproduced the segregation of chronic stress and stress susceptibility selectivities. Epigenomic analyses with H3K27ac ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq predicted distinct transcription factors for the respective gene expressions. Surgical and genetic manipulations suggested that gene expressions selective to chronic stress and stress susceptibility are mediated by different molecular pathways and involved in distinct behavioral domains. Discussion & Conclusions These findings demonstrate that microglia integrate chronic stress, stress susceptibility, and brain region selectivity in their gene expression through distinct molecular pathways, causing multiple neural dysfunctions and aggravating stress-related mental illness.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The immune system's response to viral infections can be both beneficial and dtrimental. The general immune response in a non‐suppressed organism begins with the recognition of the infectious agent and its perception as non‐self to the organism and works toward the termination of the viral infection. Conversely, the immune system may contribute to the pathogenicity of a viral infection via different responses. Cytokines, cell‐mediated effector mechanisms and antibody–antigen complexes may cause immune‐mediated viral disease. The resulting tissue damage was typically classified as four types of hypersensitivity reactions by Gell‐Coombs. Notably, Type III (immune complex) and Type IV (cell‐mediated) hypersensitivity responses are central in the pathophysiology of many viral diseases. Consequently, the host's defence against infection is more than a mere safeguard—in some cases, an overly vigorous immune response can cause pathology more severe than that induced by the virus itself. A thorough examination of the immune response to viruses also advances our understanding of autoimmune disease mechanisms, as viral infections can trigger autoimmunity through molecular mimicry and bystander activation. Understanding these pathogenic mechanisms is critical for managing the multisystemic consequences of viral diseases. This review focuses on the pathogenetic mechanisms of immune‐mediated viral infections in animals.">

        <tr id="Cell death pathways play contrasting roles in physiological processes such as responses to viral infections and vaccinations, potentially exerting either detrimental or beneficial effects. On one hand, uncontrolled cell death accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage. On the other hand, when properly regulated, these processes help establish an immunocompetent environment by activating innate immunity, which in turn stimulate antiviral immune responses. These mechanisms have emerged as promising targets for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics, immunotherapies, and vaccines. Recent advances have elucidated key aspects of cell death and DAMP pathways, highlighting their association with upstream viral sensors, their capacity to regulate immune responses, and their potential as therapeutic targets in the context of respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of cell death and DAMP pathways, focusing on their roles in antiviral immunity and pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, and vaccine immunogenicity.">

        <tr id="Mpox poses a heightened risk of severe disease and mortality among individuals with HIV, yet the molecular mechanisms and immunopathology underlying multi-organ damage caused by the mpox virus (MPXV), particularly in the context of HIV co-infection, remain poorly understood. Here, we observe increased MPXV replication, more extensive skin lesions, and impaired humoral and cellular immune responses in SIV-MPXV co-infected rhesus macaques compared to those infected with MPXV alone. Multi-organ proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses reveals upregulation of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory pathways in skin lesions and across multiple organs, especially in immune-related tissues. Abnormal activation of DNA replication and cell cycle signaling pathways, which may contribute to enhanced viral replication, is evident in both MPXV and SIV-MPXV co-infected groups. CDK4/6 may present a potential therapeutic target to suppress MPXV replication.

        <tr id="Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is the leading cause of neurodevelopmental disorders in children, including nongenetic sensorineural hearing loss. Previous studies have shown that HCMV immediate early 1 (IE1) protein, also known as IE72, contributes to brain maldevelopment. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear due to the strict species specificity of cytomegaloviruses (CMVs), limiting animal model study. In the current study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to construct a transgenic mouse model (Rosa26-LSL-IE1+/−, Camk2ɑ-Cre) specifically and stably expressing IE1 protein in brain. These transgenic mice exhibited impaired spatial working memory, hippocampal neurodegeneration, and proinflammatory activation of brain microglia and astrocytes. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that IE1 protein upregulated genes linked to metabolism and downregulated genes implicated in nervous system development. Furthermore, IE1 alters the lactate production pathway in astrocytes, thereby reducing the energy supply available to neurons. These findings suggest that long-term IE1 protein expression disrupts neurodevelopment by inducing neuroinflammation and uncoupling neurons from metabolic support by astrocytes. These results provide a clear molecular mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders in infants with congenital HCMV infection.

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the critical need for broad-spectrum antivirals with high resistance barriers. Here, we demonstrate that SB431542, a selective TGF-β receptor I (ALK5) inhibitor, exhibits potent antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through unprecedented multitargeted mechanisms. Through comprehensive in vitro, isothermal titration calorimetry, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupts its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This interaction restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36-48 hours post-infection [hpi]), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-β-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release-processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 751.8 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favorable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-β/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-β-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection, collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development.


IMPORTANCE
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for antiviral drugs with high barriers to resistance. This study reveals that SB431542, a drug previously developed to inhibit TGF-β signaling, exhibits remarkable effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 through an unprecedented triple-mechanism approach. Unlike conventional antivirals that target a single viral component, SB431542 simultaneously disrupts viral entry, assembly, and release by binding to the viral ORF3a protein and modulating host cellular processes. Most importantly, SARS-CoV-2 failed to develop resistance against SB431542 even after 50 generations of exposure-a significant advantage over current therapeutics that quickly lose effectiveness due to viral mutations. Our findings also uncover that coronaviruses exploit both lysosomal dysfunction and programmed cell death to spread efficiently, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. This research establishes SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor and demonstrates the value of targeting host-virus interactions to overcome antiviral resistance.">

        <tr id="Smoldering inflammation and neurodegeneration, primarily driven by intraparenchymal immune cell activation and glial dysfunction, remains a major therapeutic challenge in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and contributes largely to disability progression. Current disease-modifying therapies effectively decrease relapse rate and, to a lesser extent, disease progression by targeting peripheral immune cells. However, they largely fail to address Central-Nervous-System-(CNS)-intrinsic pathological processes – especially glial dysfunction – thus leaving a critical gap relevant to disease progression and therapeutic intervention. In this context, neurotrophic factors (NTF) are secreted proteins central for development and maintenance of the CNS. They promote anti-inflammatory, protective phenotypes in astrocytes and microglia, support remyelination by enhancing oligodendrocyte precursor recruitment, maturation and survival, and exert direct neuroprotective effects. Exploring their role in MS offers a novel perspective on neuroimmune crosstalk and prevention of progressive neurodegeneration. In this article, we summarize relevant findings on NTFs in MS, and give an outlook on opportunities and challenges of using these mediators as next-generation disease-modifying therapies.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TRIM) is a form of long-lasting functional reprogramming of innate immune cells and their progenitors that enhances responsiveness to subsequent stimuli. Although first characterized in myeloid cells, TRIM was recently extended to nonmyeloid cell types, including endothelial and glial cells, which also exhibit stimulus-driven, memory-like behavior. While initially recognized as a protective mechanism, particularly in the context of vaccines and acute infections, TRIM can also become maladaptive, promoting chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and disease. This Review focuses on virus-induced TRIM while also addressing microbial, metabolic, and endogenous inducers. We examine key ligands and receptors that initiate TRIM and dissect the associated signaling and epigenetic pathways. Importantly, we argue that maladaptive TRIM arises not from a specific ligand, receptor, or molecular event, but from contextual factors such as stimulus persistence, dose, tissue microenvironment, and preexisting inflammation. The nature of the secondary challenge also shapes whether a trained response is adaptive or maladaptive. We further discuss TRIM induction in the bone marrow, involvement of both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells, and the role of lipid rafts in sustaining TRIM. We review maladaptive TRIM’s potential contribution to systemic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, sepsis, cancer, and autoimmunity, along with its influence on viral vaccine responses. Finally, we outline potential strategies to redirect maladaptive TRIM and propose key outstanding questions for future research.">

        <tr id="Microglia are the innate immune cells of the brain. Recent single-cell and nucleus sequencing, along with other omics technologies, are leading the way for discoveries related to microglial function and diversity. The Nogo-signaling system is a prime target for investigation with these tools as it has previously been neglected in microglia. The Nogo-signaling system comprises approximately 20 proteins, including ligands, receptors, co-receptors, and endogenous inhibitors, which are known for their neuronal plasticity-restricting properties via RhoA and ROCK1/ROCK2 activation. It has recently been implicated in microglial function. In this study, expression patterns of Nogofamily genes in the mouse and human brain are explored. In mice, the focus is on brain cell type enrichment, patterns of expression in microglia from embryonic stages to adulthood, sex differences, and changes in expression in both acute and chronic inflammatory contexts, using publicly available RNA-seq and RiboTag translational profiling datasets. The differential expression of Nogo-family genes across age, sex, and disease/injury in mice has been identified. To analyze human microglia, a new tool, the CZ CellxGene Discover, was utilized to aggregate 21 single-cell sequencing datasets of human brain cells from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control patients. In humans, Lingo1 is highly enriched in human AD microglia, a previously undescribed finding. The Alzheimer's Cell Atlas (TACA) was used to further verify whether this enrichment correlates with disease state, severity of human AD diagnosis, or sex of patients. The current work provides a comprehensive analysis of Nogo-family genes in microglia and identifies Lingo1 as a potential therapeutic target for AD.">

        <tr id="Introduction Sevoflurane is widely used in pediatric anesthesia and has raised concerns for years regarding its neurotoxic effects on the developing brain. Studies have shown that sevoflurane can lead to neuronal cell death and neuroinflammation, which further contribute to sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity manifested as delirium or cognitive deficits. However, the molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. A factor of interest is Sin3A-associated protein 130 (SAP130), which can be released by dead or damaged cells and trigger sterile inflammation, exacerbating tissue damage by activating the macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) receptor. However, whether the SAP130/Mincle axis is involved in sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity remains unknown. Methods Using a young murine sevoflurane exposure model and a primary neuron–microglia co-culture system, we examined changes in neuronal cell death, microglial activation, cytokine production, and the expression levels of SAP130- and Mincle-signaling-associated proteins after sevoflurane exposure. We then applied SAP130-neutralizing antibody and the Syk inhibitor piceatannol to assess the impact of inhibiting the Mincle pathway on microglial activation and sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity. Results The results demonstrated that sevoflurane exposure increased the number of dead neurons with SAP130 upregulation and induced microglial activation with cytokine production in the hippocampus. These changes occurred only in the neuron–microglia co‐culture system but not in neuron or microglia monoculture. Neutralizing SAP130 or pharmacologically inhibiting syk diminished microglial activation and neuronal cell death by suppressing the SAP130/Mincle signaling pathway. Discussion These findings suggest that the SAP130/Mincle axis plays a crucial role in neuronal death and microglial activation in sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity. Targeting this axis emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate the neurotoxic effects of sevoflurane.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Microglia are the immune cells of the central nervous system and are thought to be key players in both physiological and disease conditions. Several microglial features are poorly conserved between mice and human, such as the function of the neurodegeneration-associated immune receptor Trem2. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia offer a powerful opportunity to generate and study human microglia. However, human iPSC-derived microglia often exhibit activated phenotypes in vitro, and assessing their impact on other brain cell types remains challenging due to limitations in current co-culture systems. Here, we developed fully defined brain microtissues, composed of human iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, co-cultured in 2D or 3D formats. Our microtissues are stable and self-sufficient over time, requiring no exogenous cytokines or growth factors. All three cell types exhibit morphologies characteristic of their in vivo environment and show functional properties. Co-cultured microglia develop more homeostatic phenotypes compared to microglia exposed to exogenous cytokines. Hence, these tri-cultures provide a unique approach to investigate cell-cell interactions between brain cell types. We found that astrocytes and not neurons are sufficient for microglial survival and maturation, and that astrocyte-derived M-CSF is essential for microglial survival. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses nominated a network of reciprocal communication between cell types. Brain microtissues faithfully recapitulated pathogenic α-synuclein seeding and aggregation, suggesting their usefulness as human cell models to study not only normal but also pathological cell biological processes.">

        <tr id="Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a complex pathological process that arises when blood flow is restored to the brain after ischemia, often resulting in significant neuronal damage and triggering secondary inflammatory responses. This review explores the immune mechanisms underlying CIRI, focusing on the activation and polarization of resident central nervous system (CNS) cells—particularly microglia and astrocytes—and the infiltration of peripheral immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and T lymphocytes. We discuss the central role of microglia in the neuroinflammatory cascade, their polarization between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes, and how this process influences neuronal damage and tissue repair. This review highlights the roles of the complement system, inflammasome activation, and blood–brain barrier disruption as key drivers of inflammation and neuronal injury. Additionally, we elaborate on the dynamic interactions between resident and infiltrating immune cells, which amplify inflammation and impede post-ischemic recovery. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting immune modulation, including cytokine regulation, microglial reprogramming, and targeted drug delivery systems, which offer promising avenues for improving outcomes in ischemic stroke.">

        <tr id="Pyroptosis is a mode of inflammatory cell death, characterized by cell membrane rupture and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Pyroptosis is a critical part of the innate immune response and acts as a defense mechanism against different types of pathogens, including viruses. Several respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, and SARS-CoV-2, have been shown to trigger pyroptosis through distinct mechanisms. While pyroptosis is beneficial to the host by controlling virus replication and eliminating infected cells, the exaggerated induction of pyroptosis can be harmful and cause significant tissue damage, such as that to the lung tissue during infection with respiratory viruses. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and the role pyroptosis plays during respiratory virus infections could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to reduce the morbidity caused by these infections. In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge obtained on the pathophysiological role of pyroptosis during different respiratory viral infections as well as some experimental approaches to regulating its detrimental effects to the host.">

        <tr id="Mounting evidence supports a critical role for central nervous system (CNS) glial cells in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), as well as neurovascular ischemic stroke. Previously, we found that loss of the PD-associated gene leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (Lrrk2) in macrophages, peripheral innate immune cells, induced mitochondrial stress and elevated basal expression of type I interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) due to chronic mitochondrial DNA engagement with the cGAS/STING DNA sensing pathway. Here we report that loss of LRRK2 results in a paradoxical response in microglial cells, a CNS-specific macrophage population. In primary murine microglia and microglial cell lines, loss of Lrrk2 reduces tonic IFN signaling leading to a reduction in ISG expression. Consistent with reduced type I IFN, mitochondria from Lrrk2 KO microglia are protected from stress and have elevated metabolism. These protective phenotypes involve upregulation of NRF2, an important transcription factor in the response to oxidative stress and are restricted by LRRK2 kinase activity. Collectively, these findings illustrate a dichotomous role for LRRK2 within different immune cell populations and give insight into the fundamental differences between immune regulation in the CNS and the periphery.">

        <tr id="The immunological synapse (IS) serves as the fundamental architectural framework for direct interactions and secretory crosstalk between immune cells, as well as between immune cells and other cells. Its dysregulation is thought to be a key underlying cause of immune evasion or inflammation observed in various diseases, including tumors and infections. Numerous recent studies have addressed key signaling mechanisms and reported novel targets related to IS, further broadening our understanding of its function and regulatory factors. However, a comprehensive review that highlights recent progress and consolidates past knowledge is still lacking. In this study, we delineated the pre- and postsynaptic structures constituting the IS between T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages. We also detail the specific signaling mechanisms and pathways that modulate the formation and disassembly of the IS, including cytoskeletal remodeling, membrane reshaping, integrin signaling, and force transduction. Following these experimental findings, we systematically review the central roles of IS in maintaining homeostasis and health and outline various diseases arising from IS disorders. Finally, we thoroughly explore targets and treatments related to IS on the basis of preclinical evidence and clinical trials, with the aim of providing further investigatory and therapeutic insights for researchers and clinicians.">

        <tr id="Hepatic viruses, such as hepatitis B and C (HBV and HCV), evade immune defenses and drive liver cirrhosis and cancer. They remain a major global health burden, requiring deeper research into immune responses; specifically, adaptive immunity. This study aims to analyze T cellular subsets in chronic HBV and HCV infection and investigate their potential role in the immunopathogenesis of these conditions. Methods: For our study, we collected 123 blood samples taken from patients infected with HCV (n = 36) and HBV (n = 34) and healthy volunteers (n = 53). With the use of flow cytometry, we assessed levels of CD4+ and CD8+ minor T cell subpopulations (naïve, central, and effector memory cells (CM and EM), terminally differentiated EM (TEMRA), Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, Tc17.1). Results: Despite similar total CD4+ T cell frequencies across chronic HCV, HBV, and healthy groups, patients with hepatitis showed elevated TEMRA, EM, and CM subsets alongside depleted naïve Th cells and specific CM subpopulations compared to controls. Patients with chronic HCV and HBV showed elevated CD8+ T cell frequencies versus controls, with disease-specific shifts: reduced EM CTLs but increased TEMRA CTLs, Tc1/Tc17.1 depletion (notably Tc17.1 in HCV), and higher Tc2 levels. Conclusions: Viral clearance in HBV and HCV requires a delicate balance between immunity and viral activity. Despite similar T cell frequencies (CD3+/CD4+/CD8+), minor subsets revealed distinct patterns differentiating HCV, HBV, and healthy controls.">

        <tr id="Abstract The obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii is estimated to infect a third of the world’s population. Toxoplasmosis is considered a significant worldwide disease that can lead to morbidity or death in immunocompromised individuals. Host defense against T. gondii has been demonstrated to be dependent on a rapid myeloid cell and lymphocyte response working in concert to quickly eliminate the invading pathogen. Classically, T-bet–dependent group 1 innate lymphocytes (ILC1s), natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+ T cell–derived interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are considered indispensable for host resistance against T. gondii. However, recent discoveries have illustrated that T-bet is not required for NK cell– or CD4+ T cell–derived IFN-γ. Yet, lack of T-bet still results in rapid mortality, pointing to a T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–mediated host defense pathway. This review summarizes the myeloid cell–mediated immune response against T. gondii and provides insights into the lesser known components of the T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–dependent host defense pathway for pathogen clearance.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma‐associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are oncogenic human gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) associated with a broad spectrum of malignancies and chronic diseases. However, direct studies of these viruses in humans are limited by ethical constraints, technical challenges, and their strict species specificity. To overcome these barriers, researchers have developed surrogate models, with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) emerging as a tractable and widely utilized system. MHV68 shares key genetic and biological features with EBV and KSHV, providing critical insights into GHV pathogenesis, including viral latency, reactivation, immune evasion, and virus‐host interactions. This review summarizes current cellular and animal models for GHV research, highlighting the advantages and limitations of MHV68 as a model for studying human GHVs. We explore mechanisms of viral gene function, immune modulation, and host responses, and discuss how these models have advanced our understanding of GHV‐associated diseases. Improved model systems will be essential for guiding future experimental approaches and developing targeted therapies for GHV‐driven malignancies and other related disorders.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped positive sense RNA virus and the causative agent of COVID-19. The viral envelope includes the spike (S) glycoprotein which mediates the entry of the virus to the host cell. The S protein comprises the receptor binding domain (RBD) that is responsible for binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor on the surface of target cells. ACE 2 is highly expressed on the endothelium lining blood vessels which may explain the cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) may share important mechanisms that regulate their pathogenesis and that endothelial dysfunction (ED), which has been already shown to be tightly linked to CVD, plays an instrumental role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by mainly affecting the hyperinflammatory and coaguloatory states that are seen during disease progression. Meanwhile, there is also increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19-linked ED is due to a dysregulation in lipid metabolism pathways. Of note, it has been reported that low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels correlate with the severity of COVID-19 through a potential impairment in the antioxidant capacity of HDL which may lead to lipid oxidation and the generation of oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL). Interestingly, we have previously shown that myeloperoxidase oxidized LDL (Mox-LDL) possesses an anti-fibrinolytic activity in endothelial cells; this may negatively affect the course of COVID-19 by increasing the chance of complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation events and ischemic strokes. In this article, I hypothesize that targeting inflammatory dyslipidemia could be highly beneficial in treating COVID-19 patients and improving their clinical outcome.">

        <tr id="Current treatments for ischemic stroke focus on removing neurovascular-occluding clots but overlook the resulting neuroinflammation. Clinical trials targeting brain-infiltrating peripheral immune cells have failed to improved outcomes, leaving mechanisms of neuroinflammation poorly understood. Whilst many studies have examined the inflammatory cells and cytokine profile of the post-stroke brain at days and weeks following injury onset, we propose that interventions at these timepoints are too late to limit brain damage. In this study, we examined brain immune cell composition, cytokine levels, and neurological dysfunction at hyperacute (3 h) and acute (24 h) stages following a preclinical mouse model of ischemic stroke. Interestingly, we detected elevated inflammatory cytokines in brain tissue as early as 3 h, notably before infiltrating neutrophil and monocyte arrival at 24 h. Depletion of peripheral immune cells by antibodies or genetic alteration did not dampen neuroinflammation, nor improve sensorimotor function. Intravital imaging of Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice showed that microglia, the brain-resident immune cell, display rapidly altered morphology, and swiftly upregulated cytokine production hyperacutely post-stroke. Altogether, our study provides evidence that microglia are key drivers of early neuroinflammation and modulating their function at clinically-relevant timepoints will improve stroke recovery.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND/AIMS
Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) presents with persistent symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, and cognitive impairment, even after apparent clinical recovery. Although widely reported, the biological basis of these symptoms remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the underlying cellular, immunological, oxidative, and biochemical disturbances during the recovery phase of COVID-19 and evaluate their association with clinical symptomatology.


METHODS
A cross-sectional observational study was conducted involving 120 participants who were previously SARS-CoV-2 positive, recruited ≥30 days post-recovery. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed for ER stress markers (HSP70, CHOP, GRP78), Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10), oxidative biomarkers (MDA, SOD, GSH), and biochemical parameters (ALT, AST, CRP, ferritin). T cell subsets were evaluated via flow cytometry. Statistical comparisons and correlation analyses were performed using SPSS v22.0.


RESULTS
Significant elevations were observed in all stress and inflammatory markers (p < 0.05). IL-6, CRP, and MDA showed strong positive correlations with fatigue and dyspnea scores. Treg percentages were reduced, and males exhibited higher biomarker levels than females. Persistent immune and oxidative activation was evident in the recovery phase.


CONCLUSION
Post-acute COVID-19 is associated with quantifiable cellular and molecular disturbances. This integrated analysis of ER stress, immune dysregulation, and oxidative imbalance provides a novel and comprehensive view of long COVID pathophysiology.">

        <tr id="Pidotimod, a synthetic dipeptide, has been utilized for over three decades as an immunomodulatory agent to prevent recurrent respiratory infections, particularly in immunocompromised populations such as children and the elderly. Originally developed for its ability to enhance innate and adaptive immune responses, pidotimod is now being revisited in light of new clinical insights and emerging therapeutic needs. Recent studies have expanded its potential beyond traditional indications, with evidence supporting its role in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis, and even viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Pidotimod exerts its effects by stimulating dendritic cells, enhancing toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, and promoting cytokine production, including IL-2 and IFN-γ, thereby supporting both cellular and humoral immunity. This broad-spectrum immune modulation makes pidotimod a promising adjunct in managing immune-mediated diseases and infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. In this review, we examine pidotimod’s pharmacodynamics, summarize clinical evidence from recent studies, and explore its evolving role in modern therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases. Given its safety profile and oral administration, pidotimod holds significant promise not only for preventing infections but also as part of a broader immunomodulatory approach in complex disease management.">

        <tr id="Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) has long been recognized as a cause of fatal encephalitis in animals and was only recently identified as a zoonotic pathogen causing a similar disease in humans. This study provides the first comprehensive comparative analysis of BoDV-1-induced neuropathology in human and animal end hosts, including horses, sheep, and alpacas. Using immunohistochemical analyses, we investigated the topographical distribution of BoDV-1 and inflammatory responses in the central nervous system across 19 cases. Key findings reveal distinct differences and overlaps between humans and animals. While humans exhibited heterogeneous patterns especially of the lymphocyte infiltration, animals displayed more species-specific inflammation and viral spread patterns. In horses, the hippocampus and basal ganglia were consistently affected, whereas sheep showed predominant involvement of the frontal cortex and stria olfactoria. Alpacas demonstrated a less uniform distribution but highlighted the brainstem and basal ganglia as critical sites. Intriguingly, across all species, a negative association was observed between lymphocyte infiltration and the number of BoDV-1-infected cells. These findings enhance our understanding of BoDV-1 pathogenesis and is a first step of cross-species comparison in unraveling disease mechanisms in BoDV-1 infection. Further research is warranted to elucidate the implications of these findings for therapeutic strategies and to explore the entry and dissemination routes of BoDV-1 in different hosts.">

        <tr id="Progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) represents a distinct clinical and biological entity characterized by compartmentalized neuroinflammation, chronic glial activation, and resistance to conventional immunotherapies. Unlike relapsing MS, PMS is sustained by resident CNS immune networks, where activated microglia and astrocytes orchestrate persistent cytokine signaling—particularly involving TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6—through self-amplifying feedback loops. In this narrative review, we explore how these cytokines interact with oxidative stress, iron accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired autophagy to drive neurodegeneration. Human-based evidence is integrated with insights from experimental models to clarify translational mechanisms. We also highlight fluid biomarkers (e.g., GFAP, NfL) and imaging modalities (e.g., TSPO-PET, QSM) that reflect glial activity and disease progression in vivo. Age, sex hormones, and immunosenescence are discussed as modulators of cytokine expression. Finally, we review emerging therapeutic strategies that target glial metabolism and cytokine networks rather than peripheral immune cells, offering a systems-based framework for future PMS interventions and personalized disease monitoring.">

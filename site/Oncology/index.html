        <tr id="The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory immune response. Monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been observed in monocytes of patients with COVID-19, but the mechanism and consequences of inflammasome activation require further investigation. In this study, we inoculated a macrophage-like THP-1 cell line, primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, and primary monocytes with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages does not rely on viral replication, receptor-mediated entry, or actin-dependent entry. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hNEC cultures without triggering the production of inflammasome cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. Importantly, these cytokines did not inhibit viral replication in hNEC cultures. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of primary monocytes led to inflammasome activation and induced a macrophage phenotype in these cells. Monocytic cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not from peripheral blood, of patients with COVID-19, showed evidence of inflammasome activation, expressed the proinflammatory marker CD11b, and displayed oxidative burst. These findings highlight the central role of activated macrophages, as a result of direct viral sensing, in COVID-19 and support the inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 as potential therapeutic strategies to reduce immunopathology without increasing viral replication.


IMPORTANCE
Inflammasome activation is associated with severe COVID-19. The impact of inflammasome activation on viral replication and mechanistic details of this activation are not clarified. This study advances our understanding of the role of inflammasome activation in macrophages by identifying TLR2, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 as dependent factors in this activation. Further, it highlights that SARS-CoV-2 inflammasome activation is not a feature of nasal epithelial cells but rather activation of bystander macrophages in the airway. Finally, we demonstrate that two pro inflammatory cytokines produced by inflammasome activation, IL-18 and IL-1β, do not restrict viral replication and are potential targets to ameliorate pathological inflammation in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Introduction. For four years, SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been circulating among humans. By the end of the second year, an absence of immunologically naive individuals was observed, attributable to extensive immunization efforts and natural viral exposure. This study focuses on delineating the molecular and biological patterns that facilitate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2, thereby informing predictions on the epidemiological trajectory of COVID-19 toward refining pandemic countermeasures. 
The aim of this study was to describe the molecular biological patterns identified that contribute to the persistence of the virus in the human population. 
Materials and methods. For over three years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, molecular genetic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 has been conducted, which included the collection of nasopharyngeal swabs from infected individuals, assessment of viral load, and subsequent whole-genome sequencing. 
Results. We discerned dominant genetic lineages correlated with rising disease incidence. We scrutinized amino acid substitutions across SARS-CoV-2 proteins and quantified viral loads in swab samples from patients with emerging COVID-19 variants. Our findings suggest a model of viral persistence characterized by 1) periodic serotype shifts causing substantial diminutions in serum virus-neutralizing activity ( 10-fold), 2) serotype-specific accrual of point mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to modestly circumvent neutralizing antibodies and enhance receptor affinity, and 3) a gradually increasing amount of virus being shed in mucosal surfaces within a single serotype. 
Conclusion. This model aptly accounts for the dynamics of COVID-19 incidence in Moscow. For a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics, acquiring population-level data on immune tension and antibody neutralization relative to genetic lineage compositions is essential.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include myocardial injury, heart failure, and myocarditis and are associated with long-term disability and mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and antigens are found in the myocardium of COVID-19 patients, and human cardiomyocytes are susceptible to infection in cell or organoid cultures. While these observations raise the possibility that cardiomyocyte infection may contribute to the cardiac sequelae of COVID-19, a causal relationship between cardiomyocyte infection and myocardial dysfunction and pathology has not been established. Here, we generated a mouse model of cardiomyocyte-restricted infection by selectively expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in cardiomyocytes. Inoculation of Myh6-Cre Rosa26loxP-STOP-loxP-hACE2 mice with an ancestral, non-mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in viral replication within the heart, accumulation of macrophages, and moderate left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Cardiac pathology in this model was transient and resolved with viral clearance. Blockade of monocyte trafficking reduced macrophage accumulation, suppressed the development of LV systolic dysfunction, and promoted viral clearance in the heart. These findings establish a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 cardiomyocyte infection that recapitulates features of cardiac dysfunctions of COVID-19 and suggests that both viral replication and resultant innate immune responses contribute to cardiac pathology.IMPORTANCEHeart involvement after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurs in multiple ways and is associated with worse outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. It remains unclear if cardiac disease is driven by primary infection of the heart or immune response to the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is capable of entering contractile cells of the heart in a culture dish. However, it remains unclear how such infection affects the function of the heart in the body. Here, we designed a mouse in which only heart muscle cells can be infected with a SARS-CoV-2 strain to study cardiac infection in isolation from other organ systems. In our model, infected mice show viral infection, worse function, and accumulation of immune cells in the heart. A subset of immune cells facilitates such worsening heart function. As this model shows features similar to those observed in patients, it may be useful for understanding the heart disease that occurs as a part of COVID-19.">

 The immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are still under investigation. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild in the pediatric population, some children develop severe clinical manifestations or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after infection. MIS-C, typically emerging 2-6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, is characterized by a hyperinflammatory response affecting multiple organs. This review aims to explore the complex landscape of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, focusing on innate, T cell-, and B cell-mediated immunity, and discusses the role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a superantigen in MIS-C pathophysiology. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving the management and outcomes for affected children.">

We explored antibody, B-cell, and T-cell responses to the third-dose vaccine and relationship to incident SARS-CoV-2 infection.Adults in a prospective cohort provided blood samples at day 0, day 14, and 10 months after the third-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Participants self-reported incident SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma anti–SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and spike-subunit-1 and spike-subunit-2 antibodies were measured. A sub-study assessed SARS-CoV-2–specific plasma and memory B-cell and memory T-cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by enzyme-linked immunospot. Comparative analysis between participants who developed incident infection and uninfected participants utilised non-parametric t-tests, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard ratios.Of the 132 participants, 47 (36%) reported incident SARS-CoV-2 infection at a median 16.5 (16.25–21) weeks after the third-dose vaccination. RBD titres and B-cell responses, but not T-cell responses, increased after the third-dose vaccine. Whereas no significant difference in day 14 antibody titres or T-cell responses was observed between participants with and without incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, RBD memory B-cell frequencies were significantly higher in those who did not develop infection [10.0% (4.5%–16.0%) versus 4.9% (1.6%–9.3%), p = 0.01]. RBD titres and memory B-cell frequencies remained significantly higher at 10 months than day 0 levels (p < 0.01).Robust antibody and B-cell responses persisted at 10 months following the third-dose vaccination. Higher memory B-cell frequencies, rather than antibody titres or T-cell responses, predicted protection from subsequent infection, identifying memory B cells as a correlate of protection.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the impact of viral infections on individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Initial observations suggested lower COVID-19 rates among CF populations; however, subsequent clinical data have presented a more complex scenario. This study aimed to investigate how bronchial epithelial cells from CF and non-CF individuals, including various CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations, respond to in vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV. Comparisons with the Influenza A virus (IAV) were included based on evidence that CF patients experience heightened morbidity from IAV infection. Our findings showed that CF epithelial cells exhibited reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2, regardless of the type of CFTR mutation or SARS-CoV-2 variant, as well as the original 2003 SARS-Cove. In contrast, these cells displayed more efficient IAV replication compared to non-CF cells. Interestingly, the reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in CF was not linked to the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor nor to CFTR dysfunction, as pharmacological treatments to restore CFTR function did not normalize the viral response. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and CFTR function influenced the levels of certain cytokines and chemokines, although these effects were not correlated. Overall, this study reveals a unique viral response in CF epithelial cells, characterized by reduced replication for some viruses like SARS-CoV-2, while showing increased susceptibility to others such as IAV. This research offers a new perspective on CF and viral interactions, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these differences.

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented global challenges with a diverse clinical spectrum, including severe respiratory complications and systemic effects. This review explores the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, aging, and obesity in COVID-19. Mitochondria are vital for cellular energy provision and resilience against age-related macromolecule damage accumulation. They manage energy allocation in cells, activating adaptive responses and stress signals such as redox imbalance and innate immunity activation. As organisms age, mitochondrial function diminishes. Aging and obesity, linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, compromise the antiviral response, affecting the release of interferons, and worsening COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, the development of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID has been associated with altered energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation derived from mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the interplay between mitochondria, aging, obesity, and viral infections provides insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. Targeting mitochondrial health may offer potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate severe outcomes and address long-term consequences in infected individuals.">

        <tr id="Background Limited data are available describing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections on the plasma proteome. Methods PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients, enrolled in a natural history study, underwent analysis of the plasma proteome. A prospective cohort of 66 unvaccinated and 24 vaccinated persons with different degrees of infection severity were evaluated acutely (within 40 days of symptom onset), and at three and ten months. Comparisons based on vaccination status alone and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were performed. A second cohort of vaccinated Omicron patients were evaluated acutely and at ten months. Results Acutely, unvaccinated patients manifested overexpression of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory responses, while vaccinated patients exhibited adaptive immune responses without significant inflammation. At three and ten months, only unvaccinated patients had diminished but sustained inflammatory (C3b, CCL15, IL17RE) and immune responses (DEFA5,TREM1). Both groups had underexpression of pathways essential for cellular function, signaling, and angiogenesis (AKT1, MAPK14, HSPB1) across phases. Unsupervised clustering, based on protein expression, identified four groups of patients with variable vaccination rates demonstrating that additional clinical factors influence the plasma proteome. The proteome of vaccinated Omicron patients did not differ from vaccinated pre-Omicron patients. Conclusions Vaccination attenuates the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection across phases. However, at ten months after symptom onset, changes in the plasma proteome persist in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, which may be relevant to post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections associated with post-acute infection syndromes.">

This infection model recapitulates breathing-like stretch and culture of epithelial cells at the air–liquid interface and resulted in clinically relevant cytopathic effects including cell rounding of alveolar type 2 cells and disruption of the tight junction protein occludin. Viral replication was confirmed by immunocytochemical nucleocapsid staining in the epithelium and increased shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus within 2 days post-infection, associated with changes in innate host immune responses. Together, these data demonstrate that, under the experimental conditions used in this work, this human alveolus MPS chip can successfully model SARS-CoV-2 infection of human alveolar lung cells.">

        <tr id="One possible determinant of COVID-19 severity is immune imprinting (IP) by Common Cold Coronavirus (CCCV). As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns. Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.">

        <tr id="Immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet the demands associated with immune responses. The effects of aging on these pathways and on the metabolic phenotype of the immune cells participating in antibody responses to vaccines are still largely unknown. Here we used a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 that utilizes the cellular heat shock chaperone glycoprotein 96 (gp96), engineered to co-express SARS-CoV-2 Spike (spike) protein (gp96-Ig-S). Results show that this vaccine induces comparable B cell primary responses in young and old mice at later time points, but a significantly lesser secondary response in old as compared to young mice, with the antibodies generated in the secondary response being also of lower avidity. This occurs because aging changes the B cell metabolic phenotype and induces hyper-metabolic B cells that are associated with higher intrinsic inflammation and decreased protective antibody responses. However, the gp96-Ig-S vaccine was found to be effective in significantly reducing the metabolic/inflammatory status of B cells from old mice, suggesting the possibility that targeting metabolic pathways may improve immune function in old mice that do not respond adequately to the vaccine.">

        <tr id="Few therapeutic options are available to treat COVID-19. The KEAP1/NRF2 pathway, the major redox-responsive pathway, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 as it regulates redox homeostasis and inflammation that are altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we characterized the effects of NRF2-agonist Sulfodyne®, a stabilized natural Sulforaphane, in cellular and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In pulmonary or colonic epithelial cell lines, Sulfodyne® elicited a more efficient inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication than NRF2-agonists DMF and CDDO. This antiviral activity was not dependent on NRF2 but was associated with the regulation of several metabolic pathways, including the inhibition of ER stress and mTOR signaling, which are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sulfodyne® also decreased SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the delayed induction of IFNB1 and type I IFN-stimulated genes in infected epithelial cell lines and by reducing the activation of human by-stander monocytes recruited after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, Sulfodyne® treatment reduced both early lung viral load and disease severity by fine-tuning IFN-beta levels. Altogether, these results provide evidence for multiple mechanisms that underlie the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of Sulfodyne® and pinpoint Sulfodyne® as a potent therapeutic agent against pathogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

To elucidate the alveolar immune or inflammatory landscapes of Omicron critical-ill patients, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with critical pneumonia caused by Omicron infection, and analyzed the correlation between the clinical severity scores and different immune cell subpopulations. In the BALF of Omicron critical patients, the alveolar violent myeloid inflammatory environment was determined. ISG15+ neutrophils and CXCL10+ macrophages, both expressed the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), were negatively correlated with clinical pulmonary infection score, while septic CST7+ neutrophils and inflammatory VCAN+ macrophages were positively correlated with sequential organ failure assessment. The percentages of ISG15+ neutrophils were associated with more protective alveolar epithelial cells, and may reshape CD4+ T cells to the exhaustive phenotype, thus preventing immune injuries. The CXCL10+ macrophages may promote plasmablast/plasma cell survival and activation as well as the production of specific antibodies. As compared to the previous BALF scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 wild-type/Alpha critical patients, the subsets of neutrophils and macrophages with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features presented obvious distinctions, suggesting an immune disparity in Omicron variants. Overall, this study provides a BALF single-cell atlas of Omicron critical patients, and suggests that alveolar interferon-responsive neutrophils and macrophages may extricate SARS-CoV-2 Omicron critical patients from the nasty fate of sepsis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) preferentially infects the respiratory tract; however, several studies have implicated a multi-organ involvement. Hepatic dysfunctions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been increasingly recognized and described to correlate with disease severity. To elucidate molecular factors that could contribute towards hepatic infection, we concentrated on microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that modulate various cellular processes and which are reported to be differentially regulated during liver injury. We aimed to study the infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) with SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the potential of miRNAs for modulating viral infection.


METHODS
We analysed liver autopsies from a coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-positive cohort for the presence of viral RNA using Nanopore sequencing. PHH were used for the infection with SARS-CoV-2. The candidate miRNAs targeting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were identified using in silico approaches. To discover the potential regulatory mechanism, transfection experiments, qRT-PCRs, western blots and luciferase reporter assays were performed.


RESULTS
We could detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19-positive liver autopsies. We show that PHH express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and can be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulting in robust replication. Transfection of selected miRNA mimics reduced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression and SARS-CoV-2 burden in PHH. In silico and biochemical analyses supported a potential direct binding of miR-141-3p to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.


CONCLUSION
We confirm that PHH are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate selected miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and/or the viral genome reduce viral loads. These data provide novel insights into hepatic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and associated dysfunctions in COVID-19.">

These responses, while essential for pathogen elimination, can also cause significant damage to host tissues. This work details the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, from its structure to the processes of viral entry and replication, as well as the mechanisms related to infection and activation of the immune system, which can culminate in a cytokine storm. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies, vaccines, and alternative therapies that were urgently released during the pandemic.

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has confirmed that the ability to rapidly mutate may be extremely beneficial for a virus. Not long after the first wave, new variants emerged with altered infectivity, disease severity, and mortality. These new strains most notably had numerous mutations of the spike (S) protein, a surface protein responsible for binding to and entering the host cell. The Delta and Omicron strains demonstrated increased immune evasion and improved binding affinity to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This study examines the ability of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 IgG to bind Delta and Omicron antigens, as well as their functional binding capabilities to two different S-ACE2 complexes. Twenty SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from patients who had recovered from infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in the first wave of COVID-19 and 10 pre-pandemic control samples were studied. SARS-CoV-2 exposed patients showed significantly higher levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD (p < 0.001), N protein (p < 0.001), and Omicron spike variant (p = 0.01), but not to Delta spike variant (p = 0.966) when compared with controls. Furthermore, patient samples showed significantly greater inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 binding (p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Conversely, there was no correlation between the binding inhibition of S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 receptor. This study shows there is considerable cross-reactivity of IgG generated by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Delta and Omicron variants.">

        <tr id="Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) is a common human neurotropic virus with the majority of adults harboring latent-recurrent infections. In rare cases, HSV-1 infection can access the central nervous system through the neuronal route and develop into life-threatening encephalitis. Here, we used a mouse model for HSV-1 infection to describe the transcriptomic profile of the infected brain stem at the single-cell level and with temporal resolution. Among resident brain cells, microglia increased in proportion during the course of infection, while astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cell levels decrease. At the levels of peripheral immune cells, we found notably monocytes to strongly influx the infected brain. Large dynamic changes were found in the abundance of subpopulations of the different cell types following virus infection. For instance, we identify one subpopulation of microglia exhibiting very high type I interferon and chemokine expression early during infection. This population was also enriched for viral transcripts, suggesting localization at foci of infection, and orchestrating recruitment of other immune cells. In contrast, for the infiltrating monocytes, we identified a larger panel of unique subpopulations with antiviral and inflammatory phenotypes, and found not all of these being highly positive for viral transcripts, thus indicating monocyte activities beyond the infected brain areas. Finally, investigation of endothelial cell cross-talk with other cell types revealed that cytokines derived from microglia and monocyte, but also T cells, contribute to disturbance of the blood brain barrier. Our work thus reveals for the first time the complex nature of the cellular response in the virus-infected brain, which seeks to eliminate infection but can also prime for pathological changes.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infects via the respiratory tract, but COVID-19 includes an array of non-respiratory symptoms, among them gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as vomiting and diarrhea. Here we investigated the GI pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in rhesus macaques and humans. Macaques experienced mild infection with USA-WA1/2020 and shed viral RNA in the respiratory tract and stool, including subgenomic RNA indicative of replication in the GI tract. Intestinal immune cell populations were disturbed, with significantly fewer proliferating (Ki67+) jejunal B cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques than uninfected ones. Modest translocation of bacteria/bacterial antigen was observed across the colonic epithelium, with a corresponding significant increase in plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) that may be induced by LPS. Human plasma demonstrated significant decreases in interleukin (IL)-6 and sCD14 upon recovery from COVID-19, suggesting resolution of inflammation and response to translocated bacteria. sCD14 significantly positively correlated with zonulin, an indicator of gut barrier integrity, and IL-6. These results demonstrate that GI perturbations such as microbial translocation can occur in even mild SARS-CoV-2 infections and may contribute to the COVID-19 inflammatory state.IMPORTANCEThis study investigates gastrointestinal (GI) barrier disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infections and how it may contribute to disease. We observed bacteria or bacterial products crossing from the colon interior (the lumen) to the lamina propria during SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. Bacteria/bacterial products are tolerated in the lumen but may induce immune responses if they translocate to the lamina propria. We also observed a significant increase in soluble CD14, which is associated with an immune response to bacterial products. In addition, we observed that humans recovering from COVID-19 experienced a significant decrease in soluble CD14, as well as the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 and sCD14 correlated significantly across macaque and human samples. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in GI barrier disruption that permits microbial translocation and a corresponding immune response. These findings could aid in developing interventions to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection often exhibit significant changes in T cells, particularly a reduction in CD4+T and CD8+T cells in peripheral blood, which has become a key feature of severe respiratory infection. These immune changes in T lymphocytes are closely associated with disease progression, but the specific mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further investigation. This paper reviewed the changes in the number and function of T cells in respiratory viral infections, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2, and summarized related therapeutic explorations. We believe that improving and enhancing the number and function of T lymphocytes in infected hosts is a promising strategy for the treatment of respiratory viral infections, although more systematic and in-depth scientific research is still needed.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever, is an emerging respiratory disease caused by soil dwelling fungi of the Coccidioides genus that is expected to spread from the southwest into the central U.S. by 2050. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the other 40% of patients experience a range of symptoms, from self-limiting pneumonia to life-threatening disseminated disease. The immunological events that underlie the progression to severe disease remain under defined. Here, we probed the early immune response to Coccidioides using a high dose of an attenuated strain of C. posadasii in a mouse model of infection coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing. At 24 hours post-infection, robust immune infiltration is detected in the lung, marked by high levels of inflammatory PD-L1+ neutrophils and fungal-contact dependent pro-fibrotic Spp1+ macrophages. These findings elucidate the early dynamics of the host response to Coccidioides and provide a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the lung. Importance By examining early immune dynamics in the lungs, we uncover critical insights into how myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, are recruited and differentiated during Coccidioides infection. The discovery of specific immune cell subsets, such as PD-L1+ neutrophils and Spp1+ macrophages, which are associated with inflammation and fibrosis, highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interactions that occur during Coccidioides infection, offering valuable directions for developing more effective treatments and preventive strategies against this increasingly prevalent disease.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against β-coronaviruses (β-CoVs), a family of viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2. Viral sensing via pattern recognition receptors triggers inflammation and cell death, which are essential components of the innate immune response that facilitate viral clearance. However, excessive activation of the innate immune system and inflammatory cell death can result in uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in cytokine storm and pathology. PANoptosis, innate immune, inflammatory cell death initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes, has been implicated in the pathology of viral infections. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PANoptosis in response to β-CoV infection is critical for identifying new therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease severity. In the current study, we analyzed findings from a cell death-based CRISPR screen with archetypal β-CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as the trigger to characterize host molecules required for inflammatory cell death. As a result, we identified SMARCA4, a chromatin regulator, as a putative host factor required for PANoptosis in response to MHV. Furthermore, we observed that gRNA-mediated deletion of Smarca4 inhibited MHV-induced PANoptotic cell death in macrophages. These findings have potential translational and clinical implications for the advancement of treatment strategies for β-CoVs and other infections.">

        <tr id="The unprecedented research effort associated with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) included several extensive proteomic studies that identified host proteins that interact with individual viral gene products. However, in most cases, the consequences of those virus–host interactions for virus replication were not experimentally pursued, which is a necessary step in determining whether the interactions represent pro- or anti-viral events. One putative interaction commonly identified in multiple studies was between the host adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) subunit B1 (AP3B1) and the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E). AP3B1 is one subunit of AP-3 required for the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles (LROs), and its function impacts important disease processes including inflammation and vascular health. Thus, interactions between AP3B1 and SARS-CoV-2 might influence the clinical outcomes of infection. To determine if AP3B1 has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, we first confirmed the interaction in virus-infected cells using immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). AP3B1 is required by multiple viruses to aid in the replication cycle and therefore may be a therapeutic target. However, we found that the overexpression of AP3B1 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas the siRNA-mediated depletion of AP3B1 increased the release of infectious virus, suggesting an antiviral role for AP3B1. Together, our findings suggest that AP3B1 is an intrinsic barrier to SARS-CoV-2 replication through interactions with the viral E protein. Our work justifies further investigations of LRO trafficking in SARS-CoV-2 target cells and their role in viral pathogenesis.">

Variations in HLA genotypes across individuals lead to differences in susceptibility to viral infection and severity of illness. This study uses observations from the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to explore how specific HLA class I molecules affect clinical responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By analyzing paired high-resolution HLA types and viral genomic sequences from 60 patients, we assess the relationship between predicted HLA class I peptide binding repertoires and infection severity as measured by the sequential organ failure assessment score. This approach leverages functional convergence across HLA-C alleles to identify relationships that may otherwise be inaccessible due to allelic diversity and limitations in sample size. Surprisingly, our findings show that severely symptomatic infection in this cohort is associated with disproportionately abundant binding of SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural protein epitopes by patient HLA-C molecules. In addition, the extent of overlap between a given patient’s predicted HLA-C and HLA-A peptide binding repertoires correlates with worse prognoses in this cohort. The findings highlight immunologic mechanisms linking HLA-C molecules with the human response to viral pathogens that warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a crucial role in regulation of immune response. It is believed that excessive activity of Treg cells in the early stages of infectious diseases reduces the pro-inflammatory activity of cells in the innate and adaptive immune response, thereby contributing to the development of chronic inflammation or excessive inflammation. Additionally, it is known that aging leads to changes in the quantity of Treg cells and disrupts their activity. It is established that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to fatal and severe cases of the disease, primarily among the elderly population. However, the underlying cause of the development of severe forms in elderly individuals remains incompletely understood. Thus, we hypothesized that the dysregulation of the Treg cell activity in elderly individuals may contribute to the development of severe forms and lethality from SARS-CoV-2, leading to the emergence of hyper inflammation in this population. 
To investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the immunosuppressive properties of Treg cells, venous blood samples were obtained from young healthy volunteers and elderly individuals. Dendritic cells were obtained by PBMC adhesion on plastic. Adherent monocytes were cultured in cytokine medium with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-SCF), with addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after 48 hours and incubated for an additional 24 hours with S1 or N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The obtained dendritic cells presenting SARS-CoV-2 antigens were then co-cultured with autologous CD4+-T lymphocytes ex vivo. The expression level of immunosuppressive membrane-associated and soluble molecules expressed by Treg cells was assessed using flow cytometry. 
Our results indicate that the immunosuppressive activity of Treg cells exhibits contrasting patterns in the two donor groups studied in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The proportion of Treg cells, as well as the expression levels of the immunosuppressive molecules, including tumor growth factor beta (TGF-b), CD39, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related (GITR) protein, and the levels of the intracellular immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-35, in Treg cells obtained from peripheral blood of elderly donors, significantly increased in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo, when compared to the group of young donors. Conversely, in the group of young donors were observed a decrease in the expression of these markers and an increase in the concentration of extracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ ex vivo, which activate the effector immune cells and contribute to virus elimination. 
In summary, the presented results suggest that Treg cells derived from elderly individuals exhibit elevated immunosuppressive activity in response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo. Obtained results may indicate that in elderly individuals on the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection Treg cells may also possess enhanced immunosuppressive activity, which may contribute to the overall suppression of anti-viral immune responses, thereby potentially leading to the delayed SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance and development of severe forms of the disease.">

VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain. Author Summary Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes brain inflammation in both animals and humans when transmitted by mosquito bite or infectious aerosols. The mechanisms underlying disease caused by VEEV, including the role of the immune response in brain pathology, are not well understood. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the immune response to VEEV in the brain over time using two advanced sequencing techniques. Following infection, immune cells infiltrate the brain in a sequential fashion and display different activation profiles. Different types of immune cells also display strikingly different spatial patterns throughout the brain. This study provides the most comprehensive description of the immune response to VEEV in the brain performed to date and advances our understanding of immune-driven neuropathology and identification of therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="There is a complex interplay between viral infection and host innate immune response regarding disease severity and outcomes. Neutrophil hyperactivation, including excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is linked to exacerbated disease in acute COVID-19, notably in hospitalized patients. Delineating protective versus detrimental neutrophil responses is essential to developing targeted COVID-19 therapies and relies on high-quality translational animal models. In this study, we utilize a previously established feline model for COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil dysfunction in which experimentally infected cats develop clinical disease that mimics acute COVID-19. Specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2; Delta variant) (n = 24) or vehicle (n = 6). Plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues were collected at various time points over 12 days post-inoculation. Systematic and temporal evaluation of the kinetics of neutrophil activation was conducted by measuring markers of activation including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cats at 4 and 12 days post-inoculation (dpi) and compared to vehicle-inoculated controls. Cytokine profiling supported elevated innate inflammatory responses with specific upregulation of neutrophil activation and NET formation-related markers, namely IL-8, IL-18, CXCL1, and SDF-1, in infected cats. An increase in MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free dsDNA in infected cats compared to vehicle-inoculated was noted and supported by histopathologic severity in respiratory tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses further supported correlation of NET markers with tissue damage, especially 4 dpi. Differential gene expression analyses indicated an upregulation of genes associated with innate immune and neutrophil activation pathways. Transcripts involved in activation and NETosis pathways were upregulated by 4 dpi and downregulated by 12 dpi, suggesting peak activation of neutrophils and NET-associated markers in the early acute stages of infection. Correlation analyses conducted between NET-specific markers and clinical scores as well as histopathologic scores support association between neutrophil activation and disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model. Overall, this study emphasizes the effect of neutrophil activation and NET release in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a feline model, prompting further investigation into therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating excessive innate inflammatory responses in COVID-19.">

Protein and pathway analyses showed significant alterations in neurotransmission and potentially, neuronal excitotoxicity. Elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and neurofilament light (NfL) confirmed glutamate excitotoxicity to be a key mechanism contributing to neuronal toxicity in HPeV-3 infection and can lead to apoptosis induced by caspase signaling. These insights are pivotal in delineating the metabolic landscape following severe HPeV-3 CNS infection and may identify potential host targets for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="As obligate parasites, viruses need to hijack resources from infected cells to complete their lifecycle. The interaction between the virus and host determines the viral infection process, including viral propagation and the disease’s outcome. Understanding the interaction between the virus and host factors is a basis for unraveling the intricate biological processes in the infected cells and thereby developing more efficient and targeted antivirals. Among the various fundamental virus–host interactions, autophagy plays vital and also complicated roles by directly engaging in the viral lifecycle and functioning as an anti- and/or pro-viral factor. Autophagy thus becomes a promising target against virus infection. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an accumulation of studies aiming to investigate the roles of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection by using different models and from distinct angles, providing valuable information for systematically and comprehensively dissecting the interplay between autophagy and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we summarize the advancements in the studies of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and autophagy, as well as detailed molecular mechanisms. We also update the current knowledge on the pharmacological strategies used to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication through remodeling autophagy. These extensive studies on SARS-CoV-2 and autophagy can advance our understanding of virus–autophagy interaction and provide insights into developing efficient antiviral therapeutics by regulating autophagy.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to life-threatening clinical manifestations. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at higher risk for severe courses of COVID-19. So far, however, there are hardly any strategies for predicting the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CVD patients at hospital admission. Thus, we investigated whether this prediction is achievable by prospectively analysing the blood immunophenotype of 94 nonvaccinated participants, including uninfected and acutely SARS-CoV-2-infected CVD patients and healthy donors, using a 36-colour spectral flow cytometry panel. Unsupervised data analysis revealed little differences between healthy donors and CVD patients, whereas the distribution of the cell populations changed dramatically in SARS-CoV-2-infected CVD patients. The latter had more mature NK cells, activated monocyte subsets, central memory CD4+ T cells, and plasmablasts but fewer dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, innate lymphoid cells, and CD8+ T-cell subsets. Moreover, we identified an immune signature characterised by CD161+ T cells, intermediate effector CD8+ T cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells that is predictive for CVD patients with a severe course of COVID-19. Thus, intensified immunophenotype analyses can help identify patients at risk of severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, improving clinical outcomes through specific treatment.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) remain a significant global cause of mortality and disability. Viruses constitute a substantial proportion of LRTI cases, with their pandemic potential posing a latent threat. After the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the resurgence of other respiratory viruses, including Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus responsible for LRTI has been observed especially in susceptible populations.


AREAS COVERED
This review details the inflammatory mechanisms associated with three primary respiratory viruses: SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The focus will be on elucidating the activation of inflammatory pathways, understanding cellular contributions to inflammation, exploring the role of interferon and induced cell death in the response to these pathogens and detailing viral evasion mechanisms. Furthermore, the distinctive characteristics of each virus will be explained.


EXPERT OPINION
The study of viral pneumonia, notably concerning SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and RSV, offers critical insights into infectious and inflammatory mechanisms with wide-ranging implications. Addressing current limitations, such as diagnostic accuracy and understanding host-virus interactions, requires collaborative efforts and investment in technology. Future research holds promise for uncovering novel therapeutic targets, exploring host microbiome roles, and addressing long-term sequelae. Integrating advances in molecular biology and technology will shape the evolving landscape of viral pneumonia research, potentially enhancing global public health outcomes.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable respiratory virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Since its emergence in the early 2000s, SARS has posed significant public health challenges and continues to be a concern. This review provides an overview of current treatment strategies for SARS-CoV and explores the potential utility of herbal molecules in combating this viral infection. The primary treatment approach for SARS-CoV has historically centered on supportive care, which includes oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and antipyretic medications to manage symptoms. However, with the ongoing advancement of medical research and our evolving understanding of the virus, several antiviral drugs have been developed and repurposed to target SARS-CoV. Recent developments in the field of herbal medicine have drawn attention to the potential efficacy of natural compounds in the management of viral infections, including SARS. Herbal molecules, characterized by their diverse bioactive constituents, exhibit antiviral properties that could be harnessed to mitigate SARS symptoms and inhibit viral replication. Ocimum sanctum, Tinospora cordifolia, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Panax ginseng, and Aloe vera have been identified for their immunomodulatory effects. This review highlights promising herbal molecules such as quercetin, and curcumin, which have demonstrated antiviral effects in–vitro and in some preclinical studies. While current treatment strategies for SARS primarily rely on supportive care and antiviral medications, the exploration of herbal molecules presents an exciting avenue for potential adjunctive therapies. Further research is required to validate their efficacy, safety profiles, and mechanisms of action. A holistic approach that combines conventional medicine with herbal remedies may offer new insights into the treatment of SARS and other viral respiratory illnesses.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) persist in many patients for weeks and months after recovery from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent evidence suggests that pathological changes in skeletal muscle may contribute significantly to ongoing pain and fatigue, particularly post-exertional malaise. This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PASC-related fatigue by examining skeletal muscle function and circulating factors in affected individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of patients with fatigue-associated PASC who had experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization. Skeletal muscle biopsies revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and content in PASC participants compared to healthy controls. This lower respiratory capacity was accompanied by markedly elevated circulating levels of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (sIL2R), a T cell-specific receptor. In vitro experiments demonstrated that sIL2R directly impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces mitochondrial complex III subunit protein levels in cultured muscle cells. These findings suggest a mechanism linking systemic immune dysregulation to muscle-specific mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC. This work provides new insights into the pathophysiology of PASC identifying sIL2R as a promising therapeutic target for addressing mitochondrial deficits in PASC-related fatigue and opening avenues for developing targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to pathological disorders in various organs due to the ubiquitous of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. However, tissue damage may not only be the result of viral infection. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to induce the production of autoantibodies to ACE2, and their presence is associated with disease severity. The spleen is one of the targets for COVID-19. The presence of ACE2 in the red pulp sinus endothelium cells of the spleen and in tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages positioned in the splenic marginal zone makes these cells a potential target of autoimmune reactions to ACE2 triggered by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein cross-react with a wide range of human tissue proteins and can cause tissue damage. The most common splenic pathologies in deceased COVID-19 patients are lymphocyte depletion and subsequent hemaphagocytosis. Since the spleen plays a fundamental role in the immune response regulation, splenic damage could be one of the causes of immune perturbations associated with severe COVID-19. To test the hypothesis of the autoimmune nature of COVID-19, we developed a non-infectious experimental model of autoimmune multiorgan damage caused by immunization with SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The purpose of this work was to study the spleen in rats with induced multiorgan damage caused by immunization with SARS-CoV-2 S protein, as well as the influence of pre-existing autoimmune disease on the severity of splenic damage caused by an immune response against S protein. Intact Wistar rats and Wistar rats with completed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis were immunized with S protein in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA). Control rats received an injection of IFA. No changes were detected in the secondary follicles number in the spleen of rats immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. However, in the spleen of rats with previously induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis, immunization with SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused a significant decrease in the number of secondary follicles relative to the control group. Hemosiderin deposits and macrophage hyperplasia of the marginal zones of the white pulp were detected in both groups immunized with S protein. Thus, immunization with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 causes changes in the spleen of rats similar to those detected in patients who died from COVID-19. Damage to the spleen is more varied and pronounced in rats with previous experimental encephalomyelitis.">

        <tr id="Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR1 has been implicated in maintaining self-tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and mediating antiviral immunity. Foreign viral double-stranded RNA triggers rapid interferon response and activates ADAR1 in the host immune system. Emerging data points to a role of ADAR1 A-to-I editing in the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19 disease. We identify A-to-I editing events within human whole transcriptome data from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, non-infected individuals, and individuals with other viral illnesses from nasopharyngeal swabs. High levels of RNA editing in host cells are associated with low SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p = 9.27 E-06), suggesting an inhibitory effect of ADAR1 on viral infection. Additionally, we find differentially expressed genes associated with RNA-modifications and interferon response. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected nasopharyngeal swabs reveals that cytotoxic CD8 T cells upregulate ADAR1 in COVID-19 positive samples (p = 0.0269). We further reveal ADAR1 expression increases with CD4 and CD8 T cell activation, and knockdown of ADAR1 leads to apoptosis and aberrant IL-2 secretion. Together, our data suggests A-to-I RNA editing is required to maintain healthy homeostasis of activated T cells to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. Many expect future coronavirus introductions into the human population. Hence, it is essential to understand the basic biology of these viruses. In natural infection, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein is co-expressed with all other viral proteins, which modify cellular compartments to maximize virion assembly. By comparison, most of S is degraded when the protein is expressed in isolation, as in current molecular vaccines. To probe the maturation pathway of S, we redirected its maturation by fusing S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. CD81 is a defining constituent of extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes. EVs are generated in large numbers by all cells, extruded into blood and lymph, and transfer cargo between cells and systemically (estimated 1012 EVs per mL plasma). EVs, like platelets, can be transfused between unrelated donors. When fusing the proline-stabilized form of strain Delta S into the flexible, large extracellular loop of CD81 rather than being degraded in the lysosome, S was extruded into EVs. CD81-S fusion containing EVs were produced in large numbers and could be isolated to high purity. Purified CD81::S EVs bound ACE2, and S displayed on individual EV was observed by cryogenic electron microscopy (EM). The CD81::S-fusion EVs were non-toxic and elicited an anti-S trimer and anti-RBD antibody response in mice. This report shows a design path to maximize viral glycoprotein assembly and release without relying on the co-expression of potentially pathogenic nonstructural viral proteins. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic caused the biggest public health crises in recent history. To understand the maturation pathway of S, we fused S to the tetraspanin protein CD81. The resulting molecule is secreted in extracellular vesicles and induces antibodies in mice. This may be a general design path for viral glycoprotein vaccines.">

        <tr id="Problem COVID-19 during pregnancy is linked to increased maternal morbidity and a higher incidence of preterm births, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Cellular senescence, characterized by the irreversible cessation of cell division, is a critical process in placental function and its dysregulation has been implicated in pregnancy complications like preterm birth. Senescence can be induced by various stressors, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and viral infections. Method of Study In this study, we determined whether COVID-19 had an impact on placental senescence. We examined placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=10 term, 4 preterm) compared to uninfected controls (n=10 term, 3 preterm). The placentas were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication (Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins), markers of DNA damage (γH2AX) and oxidative stress (ROS), and senescence (telomere length; cell cycle regulators, SASP). Results While no overall differences in cellular senescence markers were observed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups, we found increased secreted SASP markers and confocal microscopy revealed localized areas of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the placentas from COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces localized placental damage, warranting further investigation into its impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis, particularly affecting the elderly, who are more susceptible to severe outcomes. However, definitive parameters or mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in elderly people remain confused. Thus, this study seeks to elucidate the mechanism behind the increased vulnerability of elderly individuals to severe COVID-19. We employed an aged mouse model with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain to mimic the severe symptoms observed in elderly patients with COVID-19. Comprehensive analyses of the whole lung were performed using transcriptome and proteome sequencing, comparing data from aged and young mice. For transcriptome analysis, bulk RNA sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry following protein extraction, digestion, and peptide labeling. We analyzed the transcriptome and proteome profiles of young and aged mice and discovered that aged mice exhibited elevated baseline levels of inflammation and tissue damage repair. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, aged mice showed increased antiviral and inflammatory responses; however, these responses were weaker than those in young mice, with significant complement and coagulation cascade responses. In summary, our study demonstrates that the increased vulnerability of the elderly to severe COVID-19 can be attributed to an attenuated antiviral response and the overactivation of complement and coagulation cascades.">

        <tr id="Despite the conclusion of the COVID-19 pandemic, the coronavirus-killing ability of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) remains impressive, and investigations into its underlying mechanisms are still ongoing. The fusion peptide (FP) is a crucial site of membrane fusion and toxicity exerted by the S-protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the interaction mechanisms of FP and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The simulation results show that the given ROS (O atoms and OH radicals as examples) can destroy hydrophobic residues, negatively charged acidic residues, and peptide bonds through structurally altering essential sites. Furthermore, the reaction typically initiates from the H-abstraction reaction, followed by various types of oxidative modifications such as dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, carbonylation, cyclogenesis, ring cleavage, and decarboxylation, which are consistent with the experimental findings made on peptides. Therefore, it can be predicted that the membrane fusion ability of FP and the toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 will be reduced, with CAP functioning as a bactericidal disinfectant. The dose effects were also investigated, providing experimental guidance for the optimization of CAP. In this study, the interaction processes of FP and CAP are explored by revealing the chemical pathways and final reaction products from the computational data, thus providing a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms for inactivating SARS-CoV-2 by CAP.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a significant public health threat, particularly in children and older adults, with high mortality rates. Some of these pathogens are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza viruses (IV), human parvovirus B19 (B19V), and human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1). These viruses cause various respiratory symptoms, including cough, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Notably, these viruses can also impact the central nervous system (CNS), leading to acute manifestations such as seizures, encephalopathies, encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and long-term complications. The precise mechanisms by which these viruses affect the CNS are not fully understood. Glial cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes within the CNS, play pivotal roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and regulating immune responses. Exploring how these cells interact with viral pathogens, such as hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IVs, B19V, and HBoV1, offers crucial insights into the significant impact of respiratory viruses on the CNS. This review article examines hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IV, B19V, and HBoV1 interactions with microglia and astrocytes, shedding light on potential neurological consequences.">

Advancement of proteomic and metabolomic studies now allows deeper investigation of alterations to cellular metabolism, autophagic processes and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, while computational biology and machine learning have advanced methodologies of predicting virus–host gene and protein interactions. Particular focus is given to the interaction between viral genes and proteins with mitochondrial function and that of the innate immune system. Finally, the authors hypothesise that viral persistence may be a function of mitochondrial involvement in the sequestration of viral genetic material. While further work is necessary to understand the mechanisms definitively, a number of studies now point to the resolution of questions regarding the pathogenesis of PASC.">

To distinguish viral versus proinflammatory macrophage-mediated β cell pyroptosis, we developed human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived vascularized macrophage-islet (VMI) organoids. VMI organoids exhibited enhanced marker expression and function in both β cells and endothelial cells compared to separately cultured cells. Notably, proinflammatory macrophages within VMI organoids induced β cell pyroptosis. Mechanistic investigations highlighted TNFSF12-TNFRSF12A involvement in proinflammatory macrophage-mediated β cell pyroptosis. This study established hPSC- derived VMI organoids as a valuable tool for studying immune cell-mediated host damage and uncovered mechanism of β cell damage during viral exposure.">

However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and enduring impact, resulting in substantial loss of life. The scientific community has responded unprecedentedly by investigating various aspects of the crisis, particularly focusing on the acute phase of COVID-19. The roles of the viral load, cytokines, and chemokines during the acute phase and in the context of patients who experienced enduring symptoms upon infection, so called Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 or PASC, have been studied extensively. Here, in this review, we offer a virologist’s perspective on PASC, highlighting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, cytokines, and chemokines in different organs of patients across the full clinical spectrum of acute-phase disease. We underline that the probability of severe or critical disease progression correlates with increased viral load levels detected in the upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT), and plasma. Acute-phase viremia is a clear, although not unambiguous, predictor of PASC development. Moreover, both the quantity and diversity of functions of cytokines and chemokines increase with acute-phase disease severity. Specific cytokines remain or become elevated in the PASC phase, although the driving factor of ongoing inflammation found in patients with PASC remains to be investigated. The key findings highlighted in this review contribute to a further understanding of PASC and their differences and overlap with acute disease.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. 350,000 cases are reported annually in the U.S., although that number is expected to increase as climate change expands fungal geographic range. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the symptomatic 40% are often misdiagnosed due to similarities with bronchitis or pneumonia. A small subset of infection progress to severe illness, necessitating a better understanding of immune responses during lethal infection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we characterized lung responses during Coccidioides infection. We identified monocyte-derived Spp1-expressing macrophages as potential mediators of tissue remodeling and fibrosis, marked by high expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory transcripts. These macrophages showed elevated TGF-β and IL-6 signaling, pathways involved in fibrosis pathogenesis. Additionally, we observed significant neutrophil infiltration and defective lymphocyte responses, indicating severe adaptive immunity dysregulation in lethal, acute infection. These findings enhance our understanding of Coccidioides infection and suggest new therapeutic targets. Importance: Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Valley Fever, is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of Coccidioides fungi, which is prevalent in the Southwestern U.S., Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. With climate change potentially expanding the geographic range of this fungus, understanding the immune responses during severe infections is crucial. Our study used advanced techniques to analyze lung responses during Coccidioides infection, identifying specific immune cells that may contribute to tissue damage and fibrosis. These findings provide new insights into the disease mechanisms and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention, which could improve outcomes for patients suffering from severe Valley Fever.">

        <tr id="Waning immunity and the emergence of immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants jeopardize vaccine efficacy leading to breakthrough infections. We have previously shown that innate immune cells play a critical role in controlling SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the innate immune response during breakthrough infections, we modeled breakthrough infections by challenging low-dose vaccinated mice with a vaccine-mismatched SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. We found that low-dose vaccinated infected mice had a 2-log reduction in lung viral burden, but increased immune cell infiltration in the lung parenchyma, characterized by monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and eosinophils. Single cell RNA-seq revealed viral RNA was highly associated with eosinophils that corresponded to a unique IFN-γ biased signature. Antibody-mediated depletion of eosinophils in vaccinated mice resulted in increased virus replication and dissemination in the lungs, demonstrating that eosinophils in the lungs are protective during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. These results highlight the critical role for the innate immune response in vaccine mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant exhibits high transmissibility with a strong immune escape ability and causes frequent large-scale global infections by producing predominant subvariants. Here, using human upper/lower airway and intestinal cells, we examined the previously dominant BA.1–BA.5 and BA.2.75 subvariants, together with the recently emerged XBB/BQ lineages, in comparison to the former Delta variant. We observed a tendency for each virus to demonstrate higher growth capability than the previously dominant subvariants. Unlike human bronchial and intestinal cells, nasal epithelial cells accommodated the efficient entry of certain Omicron subvariants, similar to the Delta variant. In contrast to the Delta’s reliance on cell-surface transmembrane protease serine 2, all tested Omicron variants depended on endosomal cathepsin L. Moreover, S1/S2 cleavage of early Omicron spikes was less efficient, whereas recent viruses exhibit improved cleavage efficacy. Our results show that the Omicron variant progressively adapts to human cells through continuous endosome-mediated host cell entry. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, has evolved into a number of variants/subvariants, which have generated multiple global waves of infection. In order to monitor/predict virological features of emerging variants and determine appropriate strategies for anti-viral development, understanding conserved or altered features of evolving SARS-CoV-2 is important. In this study, we addressed previously or recently predominant Omicron subvariants and demonstrated the gradual adaptation to human cells. The host cell entry route, which was altered from the former Delta variant, was conserved among all tested Omicron subvariants. Collectively, this study revealed both changing and maintained features of SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron variant evolution.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 remains a significant threat to public health globally. Infection in some susceptible individuals causes life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI/ARDS) and/or death. Human surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a C-type lectin expressed in the lung and other mucosal tissues, and it plays a critical role in host defense against various pathogens. The human SP-A genes (SFTPA1 and SFTPA2) are highly polymorphic and comprise several common genetic variants, i.e., SP-A1 (variants 6A2, 6A4) and SP-A2 (variants 1A0, 1A3). Here, we elucidated the differential antiviral and immunoregulatory roles of SP-A variants in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Six genetically-modified mouse lines, expressing both hACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and individual SP-A variants: (hACE2/6A2 (6A2), hACE2/6A4 (6A4), hACE2/1A0 (1A0), and hACE2/1A3(1A3), one SP-A knockout (hACE2/SP-A KO (KO) and one hACE2/mouse SP-A (K18) mice, were challenged intranasally with 103 PFU SARS-CoV-2 or saline (Sham). Infected KO and 1A0 mice had more weight loss and mortality compared to other mouse lines. Relative to other infected mouse lines, a more severe ALI was observed in KO, 1A0, and 6A2 mice. Reduced viral titers were generally observed in the lungs of infected SP-A mice relative to KO mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an upregulation in genes that play central roles in immune responses such as MyD88, Stat3, IL-18, and Jak2 in the lungs of KO and 1A0 mice. However, Mapk1 was significantly downregulated in 6A2 versus 1A0 mice. Analysis of biological pathways identified those involved in lung host defense and innate immunity, including pathogen-induced cytokine, NOD1/2, and Trem1 signaling pathways. Consistent with the transcriptomic data, levels of cytokines and chemokines such as G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-1β were comparatively higher in the lungs and sera of KO and 1A0 mice with the highest mortality rate. These findings demonstrate that human SP-A variants differentially modulate SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and disease severity by differentially inhibiting viral infectivity and regulating immune-related gene expressions.">

        <tr id="Novel coronavirus disease 2019, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, initiate humoral and cellular immune responses against diverse virus antigens. The assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific is mainly carried out in routine practice by determining specific immunoglobulins. However, high variability in S-protein structure in new genovariants of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the lack of correlation between specific antibodies and CD8+ T-lymphocytes underlie false negative responses, and mass assessment of cellular immunity is complicated due to the complexity of applying ELISPOT and cytofluorometry techniques. To solve this issue, a diagnostic method was developed for assessing SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immune response, which is based on a skin test followed by evaluating a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction involving antigen-specific memory T-lymphocytes. A diagnostic preparation CoronaDerm-PS is based on Cord_PS, which is a hybrid recombinant protein consisting of parts of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, M, N, E. The specific activity of this chimeric antigen was analyzed in cultured T-lymphocyte activation test by assessing interferon-γ production using cytofluorometry. To investigate the chimeric antigen specific activity, a preclinical safety study with CoronaDerm-PS preparation in experimental animals was conducted. A dose-dependent developing skin reaction was observed in 90–100% of guinea pigs vaccinated by EpiVacCorona, CoviVac, Gam-COVID-Vac, which confirms a potential for assessing post-vaccination cellular immunity using CoronaDerm-PS preparation. Upon this, the presence of functionally active T-cell-antigenic epitopes in the recombinant polypeptide allows to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific response illustrated by detected response after Gam-COVID-Vac (S-protein) and EpiVacCorona (N-protein) vaccination. Thus, a skin test based on CoronaDerm-PS preparation may be a promising diagnostic tool for rapid mass screening requiring no specialized laboratory equipment for assessing populational SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Such a test is distinguished by advantages such as ease of analysis, high specificity and sensitivity. The final decision-making on using this test in a real-world practice may achieved after conducting further clinical safety and effectiveness trials.">

        <tr id="Introduction Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a global respiratory disease, which annually leads to 3-5 million cases of severe illness, resulting in 290,000-650,000 deaths. Additionally, during the past century, four global IAV pandemics have claimed millions of human lives. The epithelial lining of the trachea plays a vital role during IAV infection, both as point of viral entry and replication as well as in the antiviral immune response. Tracheal tissue is generally inaccessible from human patients, which makes animal models crucial for the study of the tracheal host immune response. Method In this study, pigs were inoculated with swine- or human-adapted H1N1 IAV to gain insight into how host adaptation of IAV shapes the innate immune response during infection. In-depth multi-omics analysis (global proteomics and RNA sequencing) of the host response in upper and lower tracheal tissue was conducted, and results were validated by microfluidic qPCR. Additionally, a subset of samples was selected for histopathological examination. Results A classical innate antiviral immune response was induced in both upper and lower trachea after infection with either swine- or human-adapted IAV with upregulation of genes and higher abundance of proteins associated with viral infection and recognition, accompanied by a significant induction of interferon stimulated genes with corresponding higher proteins concentrations. Infection with the swine-adapted virus induced a much stronger immune response compared to infection with a human-adapted IAV strain in the lower trachea, which could be a consequence of a higher viral load and a higher degree of inflammation. Discussion Central components of the JAK-STAT pathway, apoptosis, pyrimidine metabolism, and the cytoskeleton were significantly altered depending on infection with swine- or human-adapted virus and might be relevant mechanisms in relation to antiviral immunity against putative zoonotic IAV. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that during host adaptation, IAV evolve to modulate important host cell elements to favor viral infectivity and replication.">

        <tr id="Although vaccines have reduced the burden of COVID-19, their efficacy in helminth infection–endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal roundworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in mice. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA-vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared with animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth-mediated suppression of spike protein–specific CD8+ T cell responses occurred independently of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling, whereas blockade of interleukin-10 (IL-10) rescued vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses. Together, these data show that, in mice, intestinal helminth infection impaired vaccine-induced T cell responses through an IL-10 pathway, which compromised protection against antigenically drifted SARS-CoV-2 variants. Intestinal helminth infection blunts T cell responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in mice. Editor’s summary Much of the global population lives in areas endemic to helminths, which are known to affect responses to vaccines. To discern how helminth infection affects responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, Desai et al. infected mice with the hookworm Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) during the course of a primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series. The authors found that Hpb infection compromised T cell, but not antibody, responses to SARS-CoV-2 in an IL-10–dependent manner. Although Hpb-infected K18-hACE2 mice were protected from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 challenge through their antibody responses, they were more susceptible to challenge with an Omicron variant, which can evade antibodies but is still susceptible to T cell responses. Together, these data highlight the need to keep helminth infections in mind during vaccine development and deployment. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can increase the risk of neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegenerative diseases. Certain IAV strains, such as avian H7N7 subtype, possess neurotropic properties, enabling them to directly invade the brain parenchyma and infect neurons and glia cells. Host sex significantly influences the severity of IAV infections. Studies indicate that females of the reproductive age exhibit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses to IAVs compared to males. This heightened immune response correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, and potential neuronal damage in females. Understanding the sex-specific neurotropism of IAV and associated mechanisms leading to adverse neurological outcomes is essential. Our study reveals that primary hippocampal cultures from female mice show heightened interferon-β and pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion following neurotropic IAV infection. We observed sex-specific differences in microglia activation: both sexes showed a transition into a hyper-ramified state, but only male-derived microglia exhibited an increase in amoeboid-shaped cells. These disparities extended to alterations in neuronal morphology. Neurons derived from female mice displayed increased spine density within 24 h post-infection, while no significant change was observed in male cultures. This aligns with sex-specific differences in microglial synaptic pruning. Data suggest that amoeboid-shaped microglia preferentially target postsynaptic terminals, potentially reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Conversely, hyper-ramified microglia may focus on presynaptic terminals, potentially limiting viral spread. In conclusion, our findings underscore the utility of primary hippocampal cultures, incorporating microglia, as an effective model to study sex-specific, virus-induced effects on brain-resident cells.">

The production of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are physiologically involved in cell communication, is also altered during COVID-19, along with the dysfunction of cytoplasmic organelles. Since circulating EVs reflect the state of their cells of origin, they represent valuable tools for monitoring pathological conditions. Despite challenges in detecting EVs due to their size and specific cellular compartment origin using different methodologies, flow cytometry has proven to be an effective method for assessing the role of EVs in COVID-19. This review summarizes the involvement of plasmatic EVs in COVID-19 patients and individuals with Long COVID (LC) affected by post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), highlighting their dual role in exerting both pro- and antiviral effects. We also emphasize how flow cytometry, with its multiparametric approach, can be employed to characterize circulating EVs, particularly in infectious diseases such as COVID-19, and suggest their potential role in chronic impairments during post-infection.">

The COVID-19 proteomics and metabolomics has contributed to its diagnosis, understanding of its progression, host-virus interaction, disease mechanism, and also in the search of suitable anti-COVID therapeutics. Mass spectrometry based proteomics was used to find the potential biomarkers of different stages of COVID-19 including severe and nonsevere cases in the blood serum. Notably, protein-protein interaction techniques to understand host-virus interactions were also significantly useful. The single-cell proteomics studies were carried out to ascertain the changes in immune cell composition and its activation in mild COVID-19 patients versus severe COVID-19 patients using whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Modern technologies were helpful to deal with the pandemic; however, there is still scope for further development. Further, attempts were made to understand the protein-protein, metabolite-metabolite, and protein-metabolite interactomes, derived from proteins and metabolite fingerprints of COVID-19 patients by reanalysis of COVID-19 public mass spectrometry based proteomics and metabolomics studies. Further, some of these interactions were supported by the literature as validations in the COVID-19 studies.">

        <tr id="MPOX virus (MPXV), formerly known as monkeypox virus, led to a rapidly evolving pandemic starting May 2022, with over 90,000 cases reported beyond the African continent. This pandemic outbreak was driven by the MPXV variant Clade IIb. In addition, Clade I viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are drawing increased attention as cases constantly rise and Clade Ib, first identified in 2023, is now co-circulating with Clade Ia and seems to exhibit enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. While most infected individuals display a self-limiting disease with singular pox-like lesions, some endure systemic viral spread leading to whole-body rash with risks for necrosis, organ loss, and death. Intra-host dissemination and cellular tropism of MPXV are largely unexplored in humans. To establish a potential susceptibility of circulating immune cells to MPXV, we exposed human PBMCs from healthy donors ex vivo to a currently circulating MPXV clade IIb virus isolate in absence and presence of IFN-α2a. qPCR of DNA extracted from cell lysates, but less from supernatants, revealed increasing MPXV DNA quantities that peaked at five to six days post-exposure, suggesting susceptibility of PBMCs to infection. IFN-α2a pretreatment markedly reduced the quantity of MPXV DNA, suggesting that infection is sensitive to type I IFNs. Plaque assays from supernatants showed that infection gave rise to de novo production of infectious MPXV. In virus-inclusive scRNA-sequencing, monocytes, cycling NK cells and regulatory CD4+ T-cells scored positive for viral RNA, suggesting that these are the MPXV-susceptible cell types within the human PBMC population. Analysis of differentially expressed genes displayed a pronounced downregulation of expression pathways driving innate immunity in MPXV-infected cells, a well-established feature of poxviral infection. Pretreatment of PBMCs with current antivirals Cidofovir and Tecovirimat resulted in reduced amounts of viral antigen production and of released infectivity, suggesting suitability of the human PBMC infection model as a platform for evaluation of current and future antivirals and justifying trials to investigate Cidofovir and Tecovirimat as drugs reducing intra-patient viral spread. Together, our data suggest that human PBMCs are productively infected by MPXV which is accompanied by significant modulation of the cellular milieu. Our results have the potential to illuminate aspects of intra-host propagation of MPXV that may involve a lymphohematogenous route for replication and/or intra-host dissemination.">

        <tr id="In EAE, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, immunization with MOG autoantigen results in the generation of Th1/Th17 T cells in the periphery. MOG-specific T cells then invade into the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neuronal demyelination. Microglia, innate immune cells in the CNS are known to regulate various neuronal diseases. However, the role of microglia in EAE has remained elusive. BRD4 is a BET protein expressed in microglia, whether BRD4 in microglia contributes to EAE has not been determined. We show that EAE pathology was markedly reduced with microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout (cKO). In these mice, microglia- T cell interactions were greatly reduced, leading to the lack of T cell reactivation. Microglia specific transcriptome data showed downregulation of genes required for interaction with and reactivation of T cells in Brd4 cKO samples. In summary, BRD4 plays a critical role in regulating microglia function in normal and EAE CNS. Summary This study demonstrates that in a EAE model, microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout mice were defective in expressing genes required for microglia- T cells interaction and those involved in neuroinflammation, and demyelination resulting in fewer CNS T cell invasion and display marked reduction in EAE pathology.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and establish a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12 days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the homeostatic and preactivated microglia population decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.">

        <tr id="Risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 include several comorbidities, but age was the most striking one since elderly people were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the reasons for this markedly unfavorable response in the elderly, immunosenescence and inflammaging appear as major drivers of this outcome. A finding that was also notable was that hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 have an accumulation of senescent T cells, suggesting that immunosenescence may be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present work was designed to examine whether these immunosenescence changes are characteristic of COVID-19 and whether it is dependent on disease severity using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our cross-sectional data show that COVID-19, but not other respiratory infections, rapidly increased cellular senescence and exhaustion in CD4 and CD8 T cells during early infection. In addition, longitudinal analyses with patients from Brazil and Portugal provided evidence of increased frequencies of senescent and exhausted T cells over a 7-d period in patients with mild/moderate and severe COVID-19. Altogether, the study suggests that accelerated immunosenescence in CD4 and especially CD8 T-cell compartments may represent a common and unique outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection.">

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: In this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n=204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Results: Plasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants harboring mutations in the structural protein, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, have raised concern about potential immune escape. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in infection and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies. The mutations that occur in the structural proteins, especially in the spike protein, lead to changes in the virus attributes of transmissibility, an increase in disease severity, a notable reduction in neutralizing antibodies generated and thus a decreased response to vaccines and therapy. The observed multiple mutations in the RBD of the spike protein showed immune escape because it increases the affinity of spike protein binding with the ACE-2 receptor of host cells and increases resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections from the infected tissues and clearing them from circulation. Cytotoxic T cells efficiently recognized the infected cells and killed them by releasing soluble mediator's perforin and granzymes. However, the overwhelming response of T cells and, subsequently, the overproduction of inflammatory mediators during severe infections with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to poor outcomes. This review article summarizes the impact of mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations of RBD, on immunogenicity, immune escape and vaccine-induced immunity, which could contribute to future studies focusing on vaccine design and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019, a diversity of viral genomic variants has emerged and spread globally due to increased transmissibility, pathogenicity, and immune evasion. By the first trimester of 2023 in Chile, as in most countries, BQ and XBB were the predominant circulating sub-lineages of Omicron. The molecular and antigenic characteristics of these variants have been mainly determined using non-authentic spike pseudoviruses, which is often described as a limitation. Additionally, few comparative studies using isolates from recent Omicron sub-lineages have been conducted. In this study, we isolated SARS-CoV-2 variants from clinical samples, including the ancestral B.1.1, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and sub-lineages of BA.2 and BA.5. We assessed their infectivity through cell culture infections and their antibody evasion using neutralization assays. We observed variations in viral plaque size, cell morphology, and cytotoxicity upon infection in Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells for each variant compared to the ancestral B.1.1 virus. BA.2-derived sub-variants, such as XBB.1.5, showed attenuated viral replication, while BA.5-derived variants, such as BQ.1.1, exhibited replication rates similar to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus. Similar trends were observed in intestinal Caco-2 cells, except for Delta. Antibody neutralization experiments using sera from individuals infected during the first COVID-19 wave (FWI) showed a consistent but moderate reduction in neutralization against Omicron sub-lineages. Interestingly, despite being less prevalent, BQ.1.1 showed a 6.1-fold greater escape from neutralization than XBB.1.5. Neutralization patterns were similar when tested against sera from individuals vaccinated with 3xBNT162b2 (PPP) or Coronavac-Coronavac-BNT162b2 (CCP) schedules. However, CCP sera showed 2.3-fold higher neutralization against XBB.1.5 than FWI and PPP sera. This study provides new insights into the differences between BA.2 and BA.5-derived variants, leading to their eventual outcompetition. Our analysis offers important evidence regarding the balance between infectivity and antigenic escape that drives the evolution of second-generation SARS-CoV-2 variants in the population.">

The severe form of disease and death resulted from the failure of immune regulatory mechanisms, closely highlighted by the dual proinflammatory cytokine and soluble immune checkpoint (sICP) storm. Identifying the individual factors impacting on disease severity, evolution and outcome, as well as any additional interconnections, have become of high scientific interest.In this study, we evaluated a novel panel composed of ten sICPs for the predictive values of COVID-19 disease severity, mortality and Delta vs. Omicron variant infections in relation to hyperinflammatory biomarkers. The serum levels of sICPs from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital admission were determined by Luminex, and artificial neural network analysis was applied for defining the distinct patterns of molecular associations with each form of disease: mild, moderate, and severe.Notably, distinct sICP profiles characterized various stages of disease and Delta infections: while sCD40 played a central role in all defined diagrams, the differences emerged from the distribution levels of four molecules recently found and relatively less investigated (sCD30, s4-1BB, sTIM-1, sB7-H3), and their associations with various hematological and biochemical inflammatory biomarkers. The artificial neural network analysis revealed the prominent role of serum sTIM-1 and Galectin-9 levels at hospital admission in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors, as well as the role of specific anti-interleukin therapy (Tocilizumab, Anakinra) in improving survival for patients with initially high sTIM-1 levels. Furthermore, strong associations between sCD40 and Galectin-9 with suPAR defined the Omicron variant infections, while the positive match of sCD40 with sTREM-1 serum levels characterized the Delta-infected patients.Of importance, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of circulatory immune factors governing the COVID-19 pathology, and identifies key roles of sCD40, sTIM-1, and Galectin-9 in predicting mortality.">

Patients and methods: Experimental design: retrospective descriptive observational study. Semen samples from two groups were studied following WHO guidelines: 1) SARS-CoV-2 infected donors (n: 5; at 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after PCR diagnosis); 2) COVID-19 positive patients assisted in our laboratory between 2021 and 2022 (n: 70). They were observed in fresh and in Papanicolaou-stained smears by CASA and light microscopy; the presence of macrophages, spermiophages, ETs and hyperviscosity were recorded while neutrophilic concentration was calculated. Two control groups were designed: a) Patients belonging to group 2, studied before de pandemia (n: 13); b) Culture-negative semen samples (n: 28). Results: In the first group, ETs were observed in all the samples, while only 18% had leucospermia. Macrophages, spermiophages, and hyperviscosity were recorded in 68%, 27%, and 36% of the studied cases respectively. In the second group, ETs were present 100% in the acute phase (< 90 days after diagnosis) and decreased to 71% in the later stage (90 to 270 days). The trapped sperm were non-progressive motile or immotile alive or dead. No traps were found in either control group. Conclusion: In our study ETs were the most sensitive seminal marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has caused global morbidity and high mortality worldwide. Today it is known that, despite recovery from COVID-19, confirmed by both laboratory and instrumental diagnostic methods, many patients, regardless of the severity of the disease, suffer from a significant deterioration in health and increased exacerbations of chronic diseases. During examinations by attending physicians, they note fatigue, an increase in cases of acute respiratory viral infections per year, an increase in relapses of skin diseases such as furunculosis, pyoderma, exacerbation of pulmonary pathologies, pathologies of the urinary tract of inflammatory origin, as well as chronic infectious diseases such as herpesvirus and human papillomavirus infections, which occur for the first time or are characterized by frequent relapses no less than six months after recovery from acute COVID-19. Such persistent post-infectious consequences are known as post-COVID syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by damage to both the acquired and innate immune systems. In previous work, we determined the role of B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and the regulatory properties of CD46, as well as its involvement in the processes of viral entry into the cell. In this study, we studied the relationship of immune disorders of these factors of innate and acquired immunity with the clinical manifestations of post-COVID infectious syndrome in this category of patients and the severity of lung damage in these patients during the acute period of COVID-19. The results of the study showed that in some patients more than six months after suffering from COVID-19, the following was revealed: in patients who had a coronavirus infection without lung damage, no violations of the innate and acquired parts of the immune system were detected. In addition, significant differences were identified between clinical manifestations of diseases with increasing cases of relapses or newly identified after clinical recovery from an acute COVID-19 infection, depending on the phenotype of immune status disorders.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the critical need to integrate immunomics within the One Health framework to effectively address zoonotic diseases across humans, animals, and environments. Employing advanced high-throughput technologies, this interdisciplinary approach reveals the complex immunological interactions among these systems, enhancing our understanding of immune responses and yielding vital insights into the mechanisms that influence viral spread and host susceptibility. Significant advancements in immunomics have accelerated vaccine development, improved viral mutation tracking, and broadened our comprehension of immune pathways in zoonotic transmissions. This review highlights the role of animals, not merely as carriers or reservoirs, but as essential elements of ecological networks that profoundly influence viral epidemiology. Furthermore, we explore how environmental factors shape immune response patterns across species, influencing viral persistence and spillover risks. Moreover, case studies demonstrating the integration of immunogenomic data within the One Health framework for COVID-19 are discussed, outlining its implications for future research. However, linking humans, animals, and the environment through immunogenomics remains challenging, including the complex management of vast amounts of data and issues of scalability. Despite challenges, integrating immunomics data within the One Health framework significantly enhances our strategies and responses to zoonotic diseases and pandemic threats, marking a crucial direction for future public health breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="The inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a molecular chaperone, has been proposed to be a potential novel treatment strategy for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In contrast to other studies, our data demonstrated that RGRN-305, a HSP90 inhibitor, exacerbated the cytopathic effect and did not reduce the viral shedding in VeroE6-hTMPRSS2 cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Likewise in a murine model of SARS-CoV-2, transgenic mice treated orally with RGRN-305 exhibited reduced survival by the end of the experiment (day 12) as 14% (1/7) survived compared to 63% (5/8) of those treated with drug-vehicle. Animal weight was not reduced by the RGRN-305 treatment. Interestingly, we demonstrated that inhibition of HSP90 by RGRN-305 significantly dampened the inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in human macrophage-like cells (U937) and human lung epithelial cells (A549). Measured by quantitative real-time PCR, the mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL1B and IL6 were significantly reduced. Together, these data suggest that HSP90 inhibition by RGRN-305 exacerbates the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and reduces the survival of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but exhibits strong anti-inflammatory properties. This data shows that while RGRN-305 may be helpful in a ‘cytokine storm’, it has no beneficial impact on viral replication or survival in animals as a monotherapy. Further animal studies with HSP90 inhibitors in combination with an anti-viral drug may provide additional insights into its utility in viral infections and whether HSP90 inhibition may continue to be a potential treatment strategy for COVID-19 disease.">

        <tr id="Public health systems reported low mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in East Asia, in low-income countries, and for children during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These reports led commentators to suggest that cross-reactive immunity from prior exposure to other pathogens reduced fatality risk. Resolution of initial infection waves also contributed to speculation that herd immunity prevented further waves prior to vaccination. Serology instead implied that immunity was too limited to achieve herd immunity and that there was little impact from cross-reactive protection. Paediatric deaths exceeded those from influenza, with higher age-specific fatality risk in lower-income nations and similar fatality risk in East Asia compared with demographically similar regions. Neither pre-outbreak exposure to related pathogens nor immunity induced by initial infection waves are necessarily a reliable response to future pathogen outbreaks. Preparedness for future pathogen outbreaks should instead focus on strategies such as voluntary behavioural changes, nonpharmaceutical interventions, and vaccination.">

        <tr id="We previously demonstrated that the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients were filled with a clear hydrogel consisting of hyaluronan (HA). In this translational study, we investigated the role of HA at all stages of COVID-19 disease to map the consequences of elevated HA on morbidity and identify the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced HA production. A reduced alveolar surface area was observed in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, as visualized by a 3D rendering of lung morphology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. We confirmed the presence of HA in lung biopsies and found large quantities of proinflammatory fragmented HA. The association of systemic HA in blood plasma and disease severity was assessed in patients with mild (WHO Clinical Progression Scale, WHO-CPS, 1-5) and severe COVID-19 (WHO-CPS, 6-9) during the acute and convalescent phases and related to lung function. We found that systemic levels of HA were high during acute COVID-19 disease, remained elevated during convalescence, and were associated with a reduced diffusion capacity. In vitro 3D-lung models, differentiated from primary human bronchial epithelial cells, were used to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HA metabolism, and transcriptomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of HA synthases and hyaluronidases, both contributing to increased HA in apical secretions. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment reduced the inflammation and downregulated HA synthases. Our findings demonstrate that HA plays a role in COVID-19 morbidity and that sustained elevated HA concentrations may contribute to long-term respiratory impairment.IMPORTANCEThis study provides insights into the role of hyaluronan (HA) in the severity and long-term impact of COVID-19 on lung function. Through extensive morphological examination of lung tissues and a multicenter study, we identified that HA levels are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, correlating with a reduced lung diffusion capacity during convalescence. Using a 3D-lung model, we further uncovered how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a dysregulated HA metabolism, leading to increased HA production. Our findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting HA metabolism could offer new therapeutic avenues for managing COVID-19, particularly to prevent long-term lung impairment. Additionally, HA holds potential as a biomarker for predicting disease severity, which could guide personalized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="The incidence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased dramatically in recent years, affecting millions of people worldwide. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients is respiratory illness. However, the disease can also significantly impact the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. ACE-2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a crucial role in regulating various pathological processes. The interaction of the virus with ACE-2 in the myocardium can lead to direct heart damage. Several mechanisms may contribute to myocardial damage in COVID-19 patients, including systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon-mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response, T-cell-mediated damage, coronary plaque instability, and hypoxia. There has been concern that ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 by upregulating ACE-2 expression. However, it may be advisable to continue medications for patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders. The precise mechanisms of cardiomyocyte injury in COVID-19 are not fully understood, but necroptosis appears to play a significant role. Current treatments for cardiac damage in COVID-19 patients include IL-6 blockers and antiplatelet therapy. Ponatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed using computational and structural approaches, has shown the potential to affect cell death through its impact on tyrosine kinase activity. By reviewing studies related to ponatinib's effects on necroptosis and cell death, we propose a novel approach to potentially reduce the cardiotoxic effects of COVID-19 on cardiomyocytes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac injury in COVID-19 and to develop targeted therapies to protect the heart from the devastating effects of this disease.">

        <tr id="Neutrophilia occurs in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and is predictive of poor outcomes. Here, we link heterogenous neutrophil populations to disease severity in COVID-19. We identified neutrophils with features of cellular aging and immunosuppressive capacity in mild COVID-19 and features of neutrophil immaturity and activation in severe disease. The low-density neutrophil (LDN) number in circulating blood correlated with COVID-19 severity. Many of the divergent neutrophil phenotypes in COVID-19 were overrepresented in the LDN fraction and were less detectable in normal-density neutrophils. Functionally, neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 displayed defects in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species production. Soluble factors secreted by neutrophils from these patients inhibited T cell proliferation. Neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 had increased expression of arginase-1 protein, a feature that was retained in convalescent patients. Despite this increase in intracellular expression, there was a reduction in arginase-1 release by neutrophils into serum and culture supernatants. Furthermore, neutrophil-mediated T cell suppression was independent of arginase-1. Our results indicate the presence of dysfunctional, activated, and immature neutrophils in severe COVID-19.">

Given that the activity of neutrophils has not been described in these patients, we aimed to investigate the function of neutrophils at ICU admission and on Day 7 (D7) post admission. Neutrophil maturation and several functional indicators were investigated. We detected a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species production at D7, but we did not observe any other significant alterations in neutrophil function. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage obtained from patients displayed no inhibitory effect on the function of neutrophils from healthy donors. These findings indicate that patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS do not acquire neutrophil dysfunction within the first week of their stay, which suggests that nosocomial infections among these patients are not due to acquired neutrophil dysfunctions.">

        <tr id="Respiratory fungal infections pose a significant threat to human health. Animal models do not fully recapitulate human disease, necessitating advanced models to study human-fungal pathogen interactions. In this study, we utilized primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) to recapitulate the lung environment in vitro and investigate cellular responses to two diverse, clinically significant fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. To understand the mechanisms of early pathogenesis for both fungi, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of infected hAECs. Analysis revealed that both fungi induced cellular stress and cytokine production. However, the cell subtypes affected and specific pathways differed between fungi, with A. fumigatus and C. posadasii triggering protein-folding-related stress in ciliated cells and hypoxia responses in secretory cells, respectively. This study represents one of the first reports of single-cell transcriptional analysis of hAECs infected with either A. fumigatus or C. posadasii, providing a vital dataset to dissect the mechanism of disease and potentially identify targetable pathways. Importance Fungal infections in the lungs are dreaded complications for those with compromised immune systems and have limited treatment strategies available. These options are restricted further by the increased prevalence of treatment-resistant fungi. Many studies focus on how our immune systems respond to these pathogens, yet airway epithelial cells remain an understudied component of fungal infections in the lungs. Here, the authors provide a transcriptional analysis of primary human airway epithelial cells stimulated by two distinct fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. These data will enable further mechanistic studies of the contribution of the airway epithelium to initial host responses and represent a powerful new resource for investigators.">

        <tr id="The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), often preceded by acute lung injury (ALI), is characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory fluid in the lung alveoli, leaky alveolar epithelium and endothelium, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This progression from ALI to ARDS is a major contributor to the high mortality observed in COVID-19 patients. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to lung ACE2 and, in addition to facilitating viral cell entry, it plays an important role in the development of ALI and ARDS, especially in the later phases of COVID-19 as well as long COVID. Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 4A3 is a key mediator of ARDS pathology. This study tested the hypothesis that targeting PTP4A3 would prevent COVID-19 associated ALI. Intratracheal administration of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Subunit 1 to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 elicited pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leaky alveoli, overexpression of cytokines, structural lung injury and lung dysfunction; all these symptoms were ameliorated by the selective, allosteric inhibitor of PTP4A3, KVX-053. These findings provide the first evidence supporting a role for PTP4A3 in the development of SARS-CoV-2- mediated ALI. Significance Statement This study tested the hypothesis that targeting PTP4A3 would prevent COVID-19 associated ALI/ARDS. Intratracheal administration of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Subunit 1 to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 elicited pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leaky alveoli, overexpression of cytokines and chemokines, structural lung injury and lung dysfunction; all these symptoms were ameliorated by the selective, allosteric inhibitor of PTP4A3, KVX-053. These findings suggest that this novel PTP4A3 inhibitor may be useful against COVID-19 and potentially other viral-induced ARDS.">

        <tr id="Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a neurotropic member of the genus Orthoflavivirus (former Flavivirus) and is of significant health concern in Europe and Asia. TBEV pathogenesis may occur directly via virus-induced damage to neurons or through immunopathology due to excessive inflammation. While primary cells isolated from the host can be used to study the immune response to TBEV, it is still unclear how well these reflect the immune response elicited in vivo. Here, we compared the transcriptional response to TBEV and the less pathogenic tick-borne flavivirus, Langat virus (LGTV), in primary monocultures of neurons, astrocytes and microglia in vitro, with the transcriptional response in vivo captured by single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of a whole mouse cortex. We detected similar transcriptional changes induced by both LGTV and TBEV infection in vitro, with the lower response to LGTV likely resulting from slower viral kinetics. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a stronger transcriptional response in vivo than in vitro for astrocytes and microglia, with a limited overlap mainly dominated by interferon signaling. Together, this adds to our understanding of neurotropic flavivirus pathogenesis and the strengths and limitations of available model systems.">

        <tr id="Mucosal immunity plays a crucial role in defending against coronaviruses, particularly at respiratory sites, serving as the first line of defense against viral invasion and replication. Coronaviruses have developed various immune evasion strategies at the mucosal immune system, hindering the recognition of infected cells and evading antibody responses. Understanding the immune mechanisms and responses is crucial for developing effective vaccines and therapeutics against coronaviruses. The role of mucosal immunity in COVID-19 is significant, influencing both local and systemic immune responses to the virus. Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Mucosally delivered vaccines and those under clinical trials are being compared and contrasted to understand their effectiveness in inducing mucosal immunity against coronaviruses. A greater understanding of lung tissue-based immunity may lead to improved diagnostic and prognostic procedures and novel treatment strategies aimed at reducing the disease burden of community-acquired pneumonia, avoiding the systemic manifestations of infection and excess morbidity and mortality. This comprehensive review article outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. It also proposes that there is a significant role for mucosal immunity and for secretory as well as circulating IgA antibodies in COVID-19, and that it is important to elucidate this in order to comprehend especially the asymptomatic and mild states of the infection, which appear to account for the majority of cases. Moreover, it is possible that mucosal immunity can be exploited for beneficial diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes. The findings from recent studies on mucosal immunity in COVID-19 can be used to develop effective vaccines and treatments that can effectively target both mucosal and systemic immune responses.">

        <tr id="A series of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory disease was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Many patients have had direct or indirect links with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Wuhan. This is the prologue to the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has affected more than 150 countries and over 250,000 people worldwide, killing thousands of people. The pandemic has once again drawn public attention to the coronaviruses that developed epidemics in China (2002) and Saudi Arabia (2012). Given the structural and phylogenetic similarity of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the results of recent studies have been combined with new findings to complete one of the strangest pneumonia puzzles in the human history. Coronaviruses establish extremely complex interactions with the immune system, especially in order to evade immune responses. Undoubtedly, increasing our knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of diseases caused by these viruses will eventually lead to more effective treatment and diagnosis. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are among the leading immune response regulators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the expression and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses and in many immune disorders from autoimmunity to cancer and allergies. Our understanding of the functions of human and viral miRNAs in the pathogenesis of many viruses has increased in recent years. Accordingly, the present review article aims to review studies evaluating the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of other Betacoronaviruses. The results of these studies, given the similarity of viruses within the family Coronaviridae, could be helpful for future research on SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="A severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifests as systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement is called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). This review examines the possible relationship between gut barrier integrity, the microbiome, dysregulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling, and MIS-C. Clinical and biochemical features of MIS-C are comparable to those of other hyper-inflammatory syndromes, suggesting a dysregulated immune response. One possible explanation for the systemic inflammation seen in MIS-C patients is the SARS-CoV-2-induced dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathway. In addition, new data suggest a reciprocal link between gut barrier integrity and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits bacteriophage-like behavior, highlighting the role of bacteria as a reservoir for the virus and emphasizing the importance of understanding the bacteriophagic mechanism of the virus in fecal–oral transmission. The increased translocation of viral products and bacterial toxins may result from disrupting the intestinal barrier and cause systemic inflammation. On the other hand, systemic inflammation can weaken the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which feeds back into the loop of immunological dysregulation. In the context of MIS-C, understanding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection, IL-6, and gut barrier integrity may shed light on the etiology of the disease and guide treatment options. Since children with gut dysbiosis may be more susceptible to MIS-C, it is critical to reinforce their microbiome through probiotics supplementation, and plant-fiber-rich diets (prebiotics). Early antibiotic treatment and the use of zonulin antagonists should also be considered.">

Using in silico and experimental methods, we identified several CD8-restricted SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are either poorly studied or have previously unreported immunogenicity: fifteen from the Spike and three each from non-structural proteins Nsp1-2-3-16. A Spike peptide, LA-9, demonstrated a 57% response rate in ELISpot assays using PBMCs from 14 HLA-A*02:01 positive, vaccinated, and mild-COVID-19 recovered subjects, indicating its potential for diagnostics, research, and multi-epitope vaccine platforms. We also found that younger individuals, with fewer vaccine doses and longer intervals since infection, showed lower anti-Spike (ELISA) and anti-Wuhan neutralizing antibodies (pseudovirus assay), higher naïve T cells, and lower central memory, effector memory, and CD4hiCD8low T cells (flow cytometry) compared to older subjects. In our cohort, a higher prevalence of Vδ2-γδ and DN T cells, and fewer naïve CD8 T cells, seemed to correlate with strong cellular and lower anti-NP antibody responses and to associate with Omicron infection, absence of confusional state, and habitual sporting activity.">

        <tr id="Long-COVID caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has significant and increasing effects on human health worldwide. Although a unifying molecular or biological explanation is lacking, several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed. Involvement of mast cells-evolutionary old "multipurpose" innate immune cells-was reported recently in studies of acute infection and post-acute-COVID-19 syndrome. Mast cell activity has been suggested in long-COVID. In this case-control study, we compared data from 24 individuals with long-COVID (according to the NICE criteria) and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection without developing sequelae. Serum levels of the proteases beta-tryptase (TPSB2) and carboxypeptidase (CPA3), which are mast cell specific, were measured using immunoassays. The values were compared between the two groups and correlated to measures of physical exertional intolerance. TPSB2 and CPA3 levels were median (range) 26.9 (2.0-1000) and 5.8 (1.5-14.0) ng/mL, respectively, in the long-COVID group. The corresponding values in the control group were 10.9 (2.0-1000) (p = 0.93) and 5.3 (3.5-12.9) ng/mL (p = 0.82). No significant correlations between TPSB2 or CPA3 levels and scores on the ten physical subscales of SF-36, 3.1-3.10 were revealed. We found no significant differences in the levels of mast cell activation markers TPSB2 and CPA3 between the long-COVID and control groups and no correlations with proxy markers of exercise intolerance. Mast cell activation does not appear to be part of long-term pathogenesis of long-COVID, at least in the majority of patients.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.

Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Broad T cell phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions were prominent in COVID-19. There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry.We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients.The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the major sentinel immune cells in human alveoli and play a central role in eliciting host inflammatory responses upon distal lung viral infection. Here, we incorporated peripheral human monocyte-derived macrophages within a microfluidic human Lung Alveolus Chip that recreates the human alveolar-capillary interface under an air-liquid interface along with vascular flow to study how residential AMs contribute to the human pulmonary response to viral infection. When Lung Alveolus Chips that were cultured with macrophages were infected with influenza H3N2, there was a major reduction in viral titers compared to chips without macrophages; however, there was significantly greater inflammation and tissue injury. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, recruitment of immune cells circulating through the vascular channel, and expression of genes involved in myelocyte activation were all increased, and this was accompanied by reduced epithelial and endothelial cell viability and compromise of the alveolar tissue barrier. These effects were partially mediated through activation of pyroptosis in macrophages and release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, and blocking pyroptosis via caspase-1 inhibition suppressed lung inflammation and injury on-chip. These findings demonstrate how integrating tissue resident immune cells within human Lung Alveolus Chip can identify potential new therapeutic targets and uncover cell and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).">

        <tr id="Long COVID is a complex condition where symptoms persist for more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and affects an estimated 5-30% of individuals. While the pathobiology of long COVID is still evolving, persistent inflammation has emerged as an important feature of this condition. However, it is unclear if immune responses from COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 re-infection exacerbate or mirror the initial inflammatory responses. To address this question, we quantified 182 inflammatory and neurology-related proteins in plasma using multiplexed affinity proteomics. Plasma samples were collected 6-9 months after first infection, but before COVID-19 vaccination from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 (n=21) or from individuals with long COVID (n=12). This was benchmarked against plasma from unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals (n=24). In addition to this cross-sectional analysis, we performed longitudinal analysis in a subset of individuals (n=34), where paired samples collected 2-4 weeks after a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and after SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection were available. Boruta feature selection and lasso regression models identified a distinct plasma profile in long COVID individuals, characterised by elevated IL-20, HAGH, NAAA, CLEC10A, LXN, and MCP-1 and reduced TRAIL, G-CSF, NBL1, and CCL23 protein concentrations. Notably, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that neither COVID-19 booster vaccination nor breakthrough infection replicated inflammatory and neurology-related plasma protein profiles observed after primary infection suggesting an altered immune response outcome in individuals with long COVID upon re-exposure.">

        <tr id="Aging is physiologically associated with a decline in the function of the immune system and subsequent susceptibility to infections. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key element in the activation of cellular immunity, plays an important role in defense against virus infections. Decreased levels of IFN-γ in the elderly may explain their increased risk for viral infectious diseases such as COVID-19. There is accumulating evidence that ascorbic acid (vitamin C [VitC]) and α-tocopherol together help improve the function of the immune system in the elderly, control infections, and decrease the treatment duration. A SARS-CoV-2 strain was isolated from a patient and then cultured in the Vero cell line. The isolated and propagated virus was then inactivated using formalin and purified by the column chromatography. The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was formulated in the Alum adjuvant combined with VitC or α-tocopherol and/or both of them. The vaccines were injected twice to young and aged C57BL/6 mice. Two weeks later, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-2 cytokines were assessed using ELISA Kits. Specific IgG and IgG1/IgG2a were assessed by an in-house ELISA. In addition, the expression of PD1 and TERT genes in the spleen tissue of the mice was measured using real-time PCR. IL-4 and IFN-γ cytokines showed a significant increase in both aged and young mice compared with the Alum-based vaccine. In addition, our results exhibited a significant decrease and increase in specific total IgG and the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, respectively. Furthermore, the vaccine formulated in α-tocopherol + VitC led to decreased PD1 and increased TERT gene expression levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that α-tocopherol + VitC formulated in the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine led to a shift toward Th1, which may be due to their effect on the physiology of cells, especially aged ones and changing their phenotype toward young cells.">

        <tr id="Immunocompromised people are at high risk of prolonged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the efficacy of late-onset direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy with therapeutics in clinical use and experimental drugs to mitigate persistent viral replication is unclear. In this study, we employed an immunocompromised mouse model, which supports prolonged replication of SARS-CoV-2 to explore late-onset treatment options. Tandem immuno-depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice followed by infection with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) beta B.1.351 resulted in prolonged infection with virus replication for 5 weeks after inoculation. Early-onset treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (paxlovid) or molnupiravir was only moderately efficacious, whereas the experimental therapeutic 4'-fluorouridine (4'-FlU, EIDD-2749) significantly reduced virus load in the upper and lower respiratory compartments 4 days postinfection (dpi). All antivirals significantly lowered virus burden in a 7-day treatment regimen initiated 14 dpi, but paxlovid-treated animals experienced rebound virus replication in the upper respiratory tract 7 days after treatment end. Viral RNA was detectable 28 dpi in paxlovid-treated animals, albeit not in the molnupiravir or 4'-FlU groups, when treatment was initiated 14 dpi and continued for 14 days. Low-level virus replication continued 35 dpi in animals receiving vehicle but had ceased in all treatment groups. These data indicate that late-onset DAA therapy significantly shortens the duration of persistent virus replication in an immunocompromised host, which may have implications for clinical use of antiviral therapeutics to alleviate the risk of progression to severe disease in highly vulnerable patients.


IMPORTANCE
Four years after the onset of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the immunocompromised are at greatest risk of developing life-threatening severe disease. However, specific treatment plans for this most vulnerable patient group have not yet been developed. Employing a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-depleted immunocompromised mouse model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we explored therapeutic options of persistent infections with standard-of-care paxlovid, molnupiravir, and the experimental therapeutic 4'-fluorouridine (4'-FlU). Late-onset treatment initiated 14 days after infection was efficacious, but only 4'-FlU was rapidly sterilizing. No treatment-experienced viral variants with reduced susceptibility to the drugs emerged, albeit virus replication rebounded in animals of the paxlovid group after treatment end. This study supports the use of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for late-onset management of persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised hosts. However, treatment courses likely require to be extended for maximal therapeutic benefit, calling for appropriately powered clinical trials to meet the specific needs of this patient group.">

        <tr id="Rhinovirus C (RV-C) infects airway epithelial cells and is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in humans. To interrogate the mechanisms of RV-C-mediated disease, animal models are essential. Towards this, RV-C infection was recently reported in wild-type (WT) mice, yet, titers were not sustained. Therefore, the requirements for RV-C infection in mice remain unclear. Notably, prior work has implicated human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as essential host factors for virus uptake and replication, respectively. Here, we report that even though human (h) and murine (m) CDHR3 orthologs have similar tissue distribution, amino acid sequence homology is limited. Further, while RV-C can replicate in mouse lung epithelial type 1 (LET1) cells and produce infectious virus, we observed a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of dsRNA-positive cells following hSTING expression. Based on these findings, we sought to assess the impact of hCDHR3 and hSTING on RV-C infection in mice in vivo. Thus, we developed hCDHR3 transgenic mice, and utilized adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver hSTING to the murine airways. Subsequent challenge of these mice with RV-C15 revealed significantly higher titers 24 h post-infection in mice expressing both hCDHR3 and hSTING—compared to either WT mice, or mice with hCDHR3 or hSTING alone, indicating more efficient infection. Ultimately, this mouse model can be further engineered to establish a robust in vivo model, recapitulating viral dynamics and disease.">

        <tr id="Neutralizing antibody responses correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet higher neutralizing responses associate with more severe disease. Whether people without severe disease can also develop strong neutralizing responses to infection, and the pathways involved, is less clear. We performed a proteomic analysis on sera from 71 individuals infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, enrolled during the first South African infection wave. We determined disease severity by whether participants required supplemental oxygen and measured neutralizing antibody levels at convalescence. High neutralizing antibodies were associated with high disease severity, yet 40% of participants with lower disease severity had neutralizing antibody levels comparable to those with severe disease. We found 130 differentially expressed proteins between high and low neutralizers and 40 between people with high versus low disease severity. Five proteins overlapped, including furin, a protease which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. High neutralizers with non-severe disease had similar levels of differentially expressed neutralization response proteins to high neutralizers with severe disease, yet similar levels of differentially expressed disease severity proteins to participants with non-severe disease. Furthermore, we could reasonably predict who developed a strong neutralizing response based on a single protein, HSPA8, involved in clathrin pit uncoating. These results indicate that a strong antibody response does not always require severe disease and may involve different pathways.">

The effects of stimulation through innate and adaptive immune receptors on human lung immune cells has largely been extrapolated from studies of blood immune cells. While multiple immune cell types and many genes have been implicated as contributing to asthma, the dynamics of these in human lung immune cells following activation will yield insights into asthma pathogenesis and lung immunity more broadly. Methods and Measurements Human lung immune cells from 6 donors were isolated. Mixed leukocytes were treated separately with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), F(ab’)2-anti-human-IgM/IgG + IL4 and anti-CD3/CD28 for 4 and 18 hours and underwent single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Lung immune cell types were annotated, and gene expression compared across conditions. Genes at prior asthma-associated genetic loci were characterized across cell types, treatments and timepoints. Expression of non-classical class II genes associated with asthma, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2, and their protein products was characterized with immunohistochemistry. Main Results We characterized gene expression in 116,697 lung immune cells. Cell-, treatment-, and timepoint-specific effects on gene expression were detected in all lung immune cell populations. Correlation of gene expression between lung and blood lymphocyte populations decreased following stimulation. Among the genes that were differentially expressed, 97 receptor:ligand pairs had changes with treatments. 96.0% of genes at asthma risk loci demonstrated differential expression in at least one cell type and at least one treatment. B cells were the cell type with the highest expression of HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 which increased with anti-IgM/IgG treatment and the HLA-DQβ2 protein was identified in lung B cells from a donor with asthma. Conclusions Human lung immune activation elicits a broad range of cellular responses that deviate from those of blood immune cells and are relevant to asthma. Lung B cells expressing HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 appear to be involved in a novel antigen presentation pathway that contributes to asthma risk.">

        <tr id="Diabetes, a prevalent chronic condition, significantly increases the risk of mortality from COVID-19, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Emerging evidence implicates Cathepsin L (CTSL) in diabetic complications, including nephropathy and retinopathy. Our previous research identified CTSL as a pivotal protease promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate elevated blood CTSL levels in individuals with diabetes, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia correlates positively with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients, while acute hyperglycemia augments CTSL activity in healthy individuals. In vitro studies reveal high glucose, but not insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells, with CTSL knockout cells displaying reduced susceptibility. Utilizing lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, alongside Leprdb/dbmice and Leprdb/+mice, we illustrate increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation in diabetic comorbidities and complications.">

        <tr id="Soluble host factors in the upper respiratory tract can serve as the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we described the identification and function of a human airway trypsin–like protease (HAT), capable of reducing the infectivity of ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Further, in mouse models, HAT analogue expression was upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antiviral activity of HAT functioned through the cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein at R682. This cleavage resulted in inhibition of the attachment of ancestral spike proteins to host cells, which inhibited the cell-cell membrane fusion process. Importantly, exogenous addition of HAT notably reduced the infectivity of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. However, HAT was ineffective against the Delta variant and most circulating Omicron variants, including the BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 subvariants. We demonstrate that the P681R mutation in Delta and P681H mutation in the Omicron variants, adjacent to the R682 cleavage site, contributed to HAT resistance. Our study reports what we believe to be a novel soluble defense factor against SARS-CoV-2 and resistance of its actions in the Delta and Omicron variants.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by chronic inflammation and damage to the central nervous system, and substantial characterization of molecular signatures of glial and immune cells in the disease has been conducted. However, comparatively less well characterized is the molecular signature of pathologically inflamed neurons. Here, we accessed multi-omic high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic data to investigate the molecular signature of neurons from progressive MS patients and from mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results indicate a shared and consistent neuronal gene expression signature in MS and EAE samples including a notable upregulation of immune system related genes and processes. Analysis of immune-enriched pathways in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and motor neurons from mice subjected to EAE revealed enrichment for the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway and interferon response genes in both types of neurons, and ATAC-seq analysis confirmed the accessibility of these genes. Parallel analyses of neurons from MS patients identified a signature of 48 commonly upregulated immune genes in neurons. Prediction of transcriptional regulators of these genes identified key upstream regulators including signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon response factor 5 (IRF5), highly involved in immune-related processes, with significant gene expression changes in both RGCs and motor neurons. Protein-protein interaction analyses among the transcriptional regulators unveiled intricate interactions among transcription factors, especially from the IRF and STAT families, suggesting their importance in regulating immune gene expression in inflamed neurons. Small molecule inhibition of IRF5 in inflamed neurons in vitro promoted cell survival and reduced the expression of the immune gene signature, supporting the biological relevance of IRF5 in mediating the neuronal inflammatory response. Together, this study identifies regulated immune processes in neurons from EAE mice and from MS patient samples suggesting potential roles for neuronal immune molecules in disease progression, as revealed by transcriptomic, epigenomic, and experimental approaches. Further, the results strongly implicate active interferon signaling in neurons driving immune related changes in gene expression through IRF5 and STAT1 transcription factor activity, potentially impacting downstream neuronal survival through IRF5 activity.">

        <tr id="Most COVID-19 patients have a positive prognosis, but patients with additional underlying diseases are more likely to have severe illness and increased fatality rates. Numerous studies indicate that cancer patients are more prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19 or even dying. In the recent transcriptome investigations, it is demonstrated that the fructose metabolism is altered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, cancer cells can use fructose as an extra source of energy for growth and metastasis. Furthermore, enhanced living conditions have resulted in a notable rise in fructose consumption in individuals' daily dietary habits. We therefore hypothesize that the poor prognosis of cancer patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 may therefore be mediated through fructose metabolism. Using CRC cases from four distinct cohorts, we built and validated a predictive model based on SARS-CoV-2 producing fructose metabolic anomalies by coupling Cox univariate regression and lasso regression feature selection algorithms to identify hallmark genes in colorectal cancer. We also developed a composite prognostic nomogram to improve clinical practice by integrating the characteristics of aberrant fructose metabolism produced by this novel coronavirus with age and tumor stage. To obtain the genes with the greatest potential prognostic values, LASSO regression analysis was performed, In the TCGA training cohort, patients were randomly separated into training and validation sets in the ratio of 4: 1, and the best risk score value for each sample was acquired by lasso regression analysis for further analysis, and the fifteen genes CLEC4A, FDFT1, CTNNB1, GPI, PMM2, PTPRD, IL7, ALDH3B1, AASS, AOC3, SEPINE1, PFKFB1, FTCD, TIMP1 and GATM were finally selected. In order to validate the model's accuracy, ROC curve analysis was performed on an external dataset, and the results indicated that the model had a high predictive power for the prognosis prediction of patients. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the future targeted regulation of fructose metabolism in colorectal cancer patients, while simultaneously optimizing dietary guidance and therapeutic care for colorectal cancer patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="With circulation of SARS-CoV-2, fears about coinfection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV were significant, but the opposite was observed. Distancing/barriers played a major role in reducing other viral co-infections, however, some infrequent co-infections still occurred. We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RSV during coinfection to understand how they might compete or synergize. We found only RSV’s replication was significantly reduced when coinfected with SARS-CoV-2. Investigation of the mechanism revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp1 disrupts the RSV M2-2 protein but not the upstream M2-1 protein on the same biscistronic mRNA transcript. The impact of Nsp1 on M2-2 was not dependent on M2-2 being the second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA transcript, but likely from prevention of ribosomal termination-reinitiation necessary for M2-2 production. Additional viral ORFs from influenza A, influenza B, or Sendai virus dependent on the same or other ribosomal initiation mechanisms were tested and we found only influenza B M/M2 which likely uses a similar method as M2-2 was disrupted. Various M2-2 constructs, with/without the proposed site of ribosomal termination-reinitiating, co-transfected with Nsp1 and were in agreement that disruption to M2-2 expression occurs if the site of re-initiation was present upstream. These data not only suggest Sars-CoV-2 can outcompete RSV through suppression of M2, but may also point to potential ways to interfere with RSV by targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused unprecedented worldwide infections from persistent mutant variants with various degrees of infectivity and virulence. The elusiveness of a highly penetrant, worldwide vaccination strategy suggests that the complete eradication of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely. Even with the advent of new antiviral agents, the disease burden worldwide continues to exceed current preventative and therapeutic strategies. Greater interest has been placed towards the development of affordable,broadly effective antiviral therapeutics. Here, we report that the small branched-chain fatty acid Valproic acid (VPA), approved for maintenance of seizure and bipolar disorder, has a novel anti- coronavirus activity that can be augmented with the addition of a long-chain, polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). An EMR-based epidemiological study of patients tested for COVID-19 demonstrated a correlation exists between a reduced infection rate in patients treated withVPA of up to 25%, as well as a decreased risk of emergency room visits, hospitalization, ICU admission,and use of mechanical ventilation. In vitro studies have demonstrated that VPA modifies gene expression in MRC5 cells. Interestingly, VPA correlates with the inhibition of several SARS-CoV2 interacting genes and the greater inhibition of alpha-coronavirus HCoV-229E (a “common cold” virus) and SARS-CoV2. The VPA-DHA combination activates pre-existing intracellular antiviral mechanisms normally repressed by coronaviruses. Gene expression profiles demonstrate subtle differences in overall gene expression between VPA-treated and VPA-DHA-treated cells. HCoV-229E infection caused an intensely different response with a marked induction of multiple intracellular inflammatory genes. Changes in gene expression took at least 24 hours to manifest and most likely why prior drug screens failed to identify any antiviral VPA activity despite in silico predictions. This report demonstrates an interaction between HDAC inhibition and the potent activation of cellular antiviral responses. A foundation now exists for a low-cost, highly effective antiviral strategy when supplemented with DHA.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Throughout history, the influenza A virus has caused numerous devastating global pandemics. Macrophages, as pivotal innate immune cells, exhibit a wide range of immune functions characterized by distinct polarization states, reflecting their intricate heterogeneity. In this study, we employed the time-resolved single-cell sequencing technique coupled with metabolic RNA labelling to elucidate the dynamic transcriptional changes in distinct polarized states of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon infection with the influenza A virus. Our approach not only captures the temporal dimension of transcriptional activity, which is lacking in conventional scRNA-seq methods, but also reveals that M2-polarized Arg1_macrophage cluster is the sole state supporting successful replication of influenza A virus. Furthermore, we identified distinct antigen presentation capabilities to CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells across diverse polarized states of macrophages. Notably, the M1 phenotype, exhibited by (BMDMs) and murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), demonstrated superior conventional and cross-presentation abilities for exogenous antigens, with a particular emphasis on cross-presentation capacity. Additionally, as CD8+ T cell differentiation progressed, M1 polarization exhibited an enhanced capacity for cross-presentation. All three phenotypes of BMDMs, including M1, demonstrated robust presentation to CD4+ regulatory T cells, while displaying limited ability to present to naive CD4+ T cells. These findings offer novel insights into the immunological regulatory mechanisms governing distinct polarized states of macrophages, particularly their roles in restricting the replication of influenza A virus and modulating antigen-specific T cell responses through innate immunity.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Pro-resolving molecules may curb disease caused by viruses without altering the capacity of the host to deal with infection. AP1189 is a melanocortin receptor-biased agonist endowed with pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory activity. We evaluated the preclinical and early clinical effects of treatment with AP1189 in the context of COVID-19.


METHODS
C57BL/6j mice were infected intranasally with MHV-A59 or hK18-ACE2 mice with SARS-CoV-2. AP1189 (10 mg·kg-1, BID, s.c.) was given to the animals from day 2 and parameters evaluated at day 5. Human PBMCs from health donors were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in presence or absence of AP1189 and production of cytokines quantified. In the clinical study, 6 patients were initially given AP1189 (100 mg daily for 14 days) and this was followed by a randomized (2:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that enrolled 54 hospitalized COVID-19 patients needing oxygen support. The primary outcome was the time in days until respiratory recovery, defined as a SpO2 ≥ 93% in ambient air.


RESULTS
Treatment with AP1189 attenuated pulmonary inflammation in mice infected with MHV-A59 or SARS-CoV-2 and decreased the release of CXCL10, TNF-α and IL-1β by human PBMCs. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients already taking glucocorticoids took a median time of 6 days until respiratory recovery when given placebo versus 4 days when taking AP1189 (P = 0.017).


CONCLUSION
Treatment with AP1189 was associated with less disease caused by beta-coronavirus infection both in mice and in humans. This is the first demonstration of the effects of a pro-resolving molecule in the context of severe infection in humans.">

        <tr id="The infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with neurotropic viruses induces neuroinflammation and an immune response, which is associated with the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, involving microglia, macrophages, and T and B cells, while required for efficient viral control within the CNS, is also associated with neuropathology. Under pathological events, such as CNS viral infection, microglia/macrophage undergo a reactive response, leading to the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery into the brain, disrupting CNS homeostasis and contributing to the pathogenesis of disease. The Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelination disease (TMEV-IDD), which serves as a mouse model of MS. This murine model made significant contributions to our understanding of the pathophysiology of MS following subsequent to infection. Microglia/macrophages could be activated into two different states, classic activated state (M1 state) and alternative activated state (M2 state) during TMEV infection. M1 possesses the capacity to initiate inflammatory response and secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M2-liked microglia/macrophages are anti-inflammatory characterized by the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This review aims to discuss the roles of microglia/macrophages M1/M2-liked polarization during TMEV infection, and explore the potential therapeutic effect of balancing M1/M2-liked polarization of microglia/macrophages on MS.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Objectives Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse neonatal outcome, primarily preterm birth and stillbirth. Our study aimed to investigate to which extent SARS-CoV-2 affects placental tissue and if viral replication within the placenta is evident, thus if there is a correlation between placental damage and adverse pregnancy outcome such as stillbirth. Methods We prospectively collected placentas from 61 SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women and 10 controls. Histopathological, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization studies were performed on all placentas with antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 proteins, ACE2, various immune cells, and inflammatory markers or probes for SARS-CoV-2 genes and an antisense strand. Results The measured scores of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, and antisense strand indicating replication correlated with both the severity of maternal symptoms and presence of stillbirth. Specifically, 15/61 placentas exhibited replication, while the three cases with stillbirth had high or maximal replication scores. ACE2-H-score was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients, while the expression of various immune cells did not differ statistically. In multivariate analysis, presence of maternal comorbidities correlated with presence of severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion We report evidence of active in vivo SARS-CoV-2 replication in the placenta after maternal infection in pregnancy in a case–control setting in a large population. Intensity of placental viral replication as well as viral levels were higher in women with severe or critical COVID-19 disease, supporting the rationale that severity of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection could correlate with the severity of placentitis. Replication was maximal in cases of stillbirth, which suggests direct placental involvement in the pathophysiology of this dramatic outcome. Continuing to advocate for preventive measures against COVID-19 during pregnancy, including (re)vaccination, as well as appropriately counseling women with diagnosed infection, are of utter importance.">

        <tr id="Background: Studies have reported that 5hmC features in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could serve as early warning biomarkers for the occurrence and progression of COVID-19, as well as myocardial injury. However, its roles in the occurrence and progression of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) following COVID-19 infection has not been fully studied. Methods: Firstly, we used the 5hmC-Seal technique to obtain genome-wide 5hmC profiles from plasma cfDNA of 24 ACS2N patients (individuals experiencing ACS onset within 2 months after COVID-19 infection), 28 ACS2W patients (individuals experiencing ACS onset beyond 2 months after COVID-19 infection), and 16 ACS patients (patients with ACS without COVID-19 infection). Secondly, we performed GO, KEGG analysis on the differentially expressed genes and identified a series of immune and inflammation related genes. Thirdly, the distribution of immune cells in different groups of patients was studied by immune infiltration analysis. Finally, we performed PPI network analysis on these genes to identify potential key target genes. Results: In this study, we firstly found that there was a significant difference in 5hmC levels between ACS2N patients and ACS patients, while the difference between ACS2W and ACS was not significant. Secondly, it was found that neutrophils were abnormally activated in the ACS2N group. Finally, a target gene phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) was found to be highly expressed in the ACS2N group by PPI network analysis of the differential genes and validated with external datasets. Conclusions: Our study suggested that 5hmC markers extracted from plasma cfDNA could differentiate between ACS2N and ACS patients. In addition, we observed that neutrophils exhibited abnormal activation in ACS2N patients. Further analysis showed that COVID-19 infection may affect the occurrence and development of ACS by abnormally up-regulating PDE4D gene expression.">

        <tr id="Introduction The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication of severe COVID-19 and contributes to patient morbidity and mortality. ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by various insults, and results in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Patients with ARDS from COVID-19 may represent a subgroup of ARDS patients with distinct molecular profiles that drive disease outcomes. Here, we hypothesized that longitudinal transcriptomic analysis may identify distinct dynamic pathobiological pathways during COVID-19 ARDS. Methods We identified a patient cohort from an existing ICU biorepository and established three groups for comparison: 1) patients with COVID-19 ARDS that survived hospitalization (COVID survivors, n = 4), 2) patients with COVID-19 ARDS that did not survive hospitalization (COVID non-survivors, n = 5), and 3) patients with ARDS from other causes as a control group (ARDS controls, n = 4). RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at 4 time points (Days 1, 3, 7, and 10 following ICU admission) and analyzed by bulk RNA sequencing. Results We first compared transcriptomes between groups at individual timepoints and observed significant heterogeneity in differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Next, we utilized the likelihood ratio test to identify genes that exhibit different patterns of change over time between the 3 groups and identified 341 DEGs across time, including hemoglobin subunit alpha 2 (HBA1, HBA2), hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB), von Willebrand factor C and EGF domains (VWCE), and carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1), which all demonstrated persistent upregulation in the COVID non-survivors compared to COVID survivors. Of the 341 DEGs, 314 demonstrated a similar pattern of persistent increased gene expression in COVID non-survivors compared to survivors, associated with canonical pathways of iron homeostasis signaling, erythrocyte interaction with oxygen and carbon dioxide, erythropoietin signaling, heme biosynthesis, metabolism of porphyrins, and iron uptake and transport. Discussion These findings describe significant differences in gene regulation during patient ICU course between survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19 ARDS. We identified multiple pathways that suggest heme and red blood cell metabolism contribute to disease outcomes. This approach is generalizable to larger cohorts and supports an approach of longitudinal sampling in ARDS molecular profiling studies, which may identify novel targetable pathways of injury and resolution.">

        <tr id="Although the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), primarily manifests as severe respiratory distress, its impact on the cardiovascular system is also notable. Studies reveal that COVID-19 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID-19 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely under-reviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID-19 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is one of the most prevalent respiratory pathogens in horses with a high impact on animal health worldwide. Entry of the virus into epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and rapid local viral replication is followed by infection of local lymphoid tissues leading to cell-associated viremia and disease progression. Pre-existing mucosal immunity has previously been shown to reduce viral shedding and prevent viremia, consequently limiting severe disease manifestations. Here, nasopharyngeal transcriptomic profiling was used to identify differentially expressed genes following EHV-1 challenge in horses with different EHV-1 immune statuses. Immune horses (n = 4) did neither develop clinical disease nor viremia and did not shed virus after experimental infection, while non-immune horses (n = 4) did all the above. RNA sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal samples pre- and 24 hours post-infection (24hpi). At 24hpi, 109 and 44 genes were upregulated in immune horses and non-immune horses, respectively, and three genes were explored in further detail. Antileukoproteinase (SLPI) gene expression increased 2.1-fold within 24 hours in immune horses in concert with protein secretion. Interferon (IFN)-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) and 3 (IFIT3) were upregulated in non-immune horses, corresponding with nasal IFN-α secretion and viral replication. By contrast, neither IFIT expression nor IFN-α secretion was induced by EHV-1 infection of immune horses. Transcriptomic profiling offered a tool to identify, for the first time, the role of SLPI in innate immunity against EHV-1, and further emphasized the central role of the type I IFN response in the anti-viral defense of non-immune horses.


IMPORTANCE
Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) remains a considerable concern in the equine industry, with yearly outbreaks resulting in morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. In addition to its importance in equine health, EHV-1 is a respiratory pathogen and an alphaherpesvirus, and it may serve as a model for other viruses with similar pathogenicity or phylogeny. Large animal models allow the collection of high-volume samples longitudinally, permitting in-depth investigation of immunological processes. This study was performed on bio-banked nasopharyngeal samples from an EHV-1 infection experiment, where clinical outcomes had previously been determined. Matched nucleic acid and protein samples throughout infection permitted longitudinal quantification of the protein or related proteins of selected differentially expressed genes detected during the transcriptomic screen. The results of this manuscript identified novel innate immune pathways of the upper respiratory tract during the first 24 hours of EHV-1 infection, offering a first look at the components of early mucosal immunity that are indicative of protection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains an international health problem caused by the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of May 2024, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths globally. Despite current vaccination programs, infections are still rapidly increasing, mainly due to the appearance and spread of new variants, variations in immunization rates, and limitations of current vaccines in preventing transmission. This underscores the need for pan-variant antivirals and treatments. The interferon (IFN) system is a critical element of the innate immune response and serves as a frontline defense against viruses. It induces a generalized antiviral state by transiently upregulating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To gain a deeper comprehension of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, its connection to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and the potential therapeutic implications, this review provides a detailed overview of fundamental aspects of the diverse ISGs identified for their antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. It emphasizes the importance of these proteins in controlling viral replication and spread. Furthermore, we explore methodological approaches for the identification of ISGs and conduct a comparative analysis with other viruses.

        <tr id="Mitochondria play pivotal roles in sustaining various biological functions including energy metabolism, cellular signaling transduction, and innate immune responses. Viruses exploit cellular metabolic synthesis to facilitate viral replication, potentially disrupting mitochondrial functions and subsequently eliciting a cascade of proinflammatory responses in host cells. Additionally, the disruption of mitochondrial membranes is involved in immune regulation. During viral infections, mitochondria orchestrate innate immune responses through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of mitochondrial DNA, which serves as an effective defense mechanism against virus invasion. The targeting of mitochondrial damage may represent a novel approach to antiviral intervention. This review summarizes the regulatory mechanism underlying proinflammatory response induced by mitochondrial damage during viral infections, providing new insights for antiviral strategies.">

Postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) affect a considerable number of patients, impairing their quality of life. While the role of the cytokine storm in acute COVID-19 is well established, its contribution to the pathophysiology of PASC is not fully understood. This study aimed to analyze the cytokine profile of patients with PASC following in vitro stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, comparing them with a healthy control group. From October 2020 till March 2021, Brugmann University Hospital's clinical research unit included patients with PASC in the study. Whole blood samples were collected from 50 patients and 25 healthy volunteers. After in vitro stimulation under five different conditions, cytokine levels were measured using a multiplex method. Significantly decreased cytokine levels were observed in patients with PASC compared with healthy volunteers, particularly after TLR4 (interleukin [IL]-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-10, interferon (IFN)α, IFNγ, IFNω, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α) and TLR7/8 (IL-1α, IL-1β, IFNα, IFNω, IFNγ, and TNFα) pathway stimulation. Principal component analysis identified two distinct clusters, suggesting a likely dysregulation of immunity involving TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways in patients with PASC. Our study suggests that TLR4 and TLR7/8 pathways play a role in the pathophysiology of PASC. Continuous basal activation of immunity could explain the high basal concentrations of cytokines described in these patients and the decreased amplitude of response of these signaling pathways following specific stimulation.">

        <tr id="Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common major complication of preterm birth. Supplemental oxygen administration, while lifesaving in the neonatal period, remains a key determinant of BPD pathophysiology. Exposure of the immature lung to increased levels of oxygen elicits an inflammatory response resulting in abnormal lung development. However, not every premature infant is equally sensitive to develop BPD. Using genetically diverse mouse strains, we show that the innate immune response activated in the lungs of mice sensitive to hyperoxia that develop BPD-like lung injury differs from mice resilient to disease. Specifically, we identified a selective upregulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) on lung macrophages and monocytes in the hyperoxia-sensitive C57BL/6J mouse strain. We show that loss of function of TREM2 signaling in myeloid cells resulted in a dramatically improved phenotype after neonatal hyperoxia exposure characterized by a dampened immune response, preserved alveolar structure, and preserved cell proliferative potential supporting normal lung development. At the molecular level, inhibition of TREM2 signaling dampened the magnitude of p53 activation and resulted in cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. These findings show that TREM2 is a critical regulator of the pathogenic innate immune response to hyperoxia and highlight its importance as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating injury in the hyperoxia-exposed developing lung.">

In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung via neutrophils and IFNγ signalling, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (LPS) or viral (polyI:C) challenges.

There is a need for new drug screening technologies that can parse drug candidates with increased likelihood of clinical utility early in development in order to increase the cost-effectiveness of this pipeline. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, resources were rapidly mobilized to identify effective therapeutic treatments but many lead antiviral compounds failed to demonstrate efficacy when progressed to human trials. To address the lack of predictive preclinical drug screening tools, PREDICT96-ALI, a high-throughput (n = 96) microphysiological system (MPS)  that recapitulates primary human tracheobronchial tissue,is adapted for the evaluation of differential antiviral efficacy of native SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Here, PREDICT96-ALI resolves both the differential viral kinetics between variants and the efficacy of antiviral compounds over a range of drug doses. PREDICT96-ALI is able to distinguish clinically efficacious antiviral therapies like remdesivir and nirmatrelvir from promising lead compounds that do not show clinical efficacy. Importantly, results from this proof-of-concept study track with known clinical outcomes, demonstrate the feasibility of this technology as a prognostic drug discovery tool.">

Acute infectious diseases are some of the most common reasons for receiving medical care, and analysis of the host immune response is an attractive approach for their diagnosis. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential usefulness of CD169 expression on peripheral monocytes (mCD169) as a marker of viral-associated host immune response.


METHODS
In a large mono-institutional cohort of 4,025 patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) and other viral infections, mCD169 analysis was performed by rapid flow cytometry assay.


RESULTS
Increased mCD169 values (median, 17.50; IQR, 8.40-25.72) were found in 1,631 patients with CoV2+ acute infection compared to 2,394 in CoV2- patients (median, 2.35; IQR, 2.0-3.25) (odds ratio [OR], 21.84; 95% CI ,17.53-27.21; P < .001). Among CoV2- patients, 1,484 (62.0%) were assessed for other viral infections, and viral etiology was laboratory confirmed in 428 patients (CoV2- Vir+), with RNA viruses most frequently detected (94.6%). Higher levels of mCD169 were also confirmed in CoV2- Vir+ compared to CoV2- Vir- patients (OR, 10.05; 95% CI, 7.35-13.74; P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS
mCD169 analysis by rapid flow cytometry assay may be a sensitive broad marker useful for the rapid triage of patients with suspected acute viral infections and could potentially be directly applied to eventual new emergent viral outbreaks.">

They include a variety of symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of smell (anosmia), and neurological–cognitive sequelae, such as memory loss, anxiety, brain fog, acute encephalitis, and stroke, collectively called long neuro-COVID-19 (long neuro-COVID). They also include cardiopulmonary sequelae, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary damage, fibrosis, gastrointestinal dysregulation, renal failure, and vascular endothelial dysregulation, and the onset of new diabetes, with each symptom usually being treated individually. The main unmet challenge is to understand the mechanisms of the pathophysiologic sequelae, in particular the neurological symptoms. This mini-review presents the main mechanistic hypotheses considered to explain the multiple long neuro-COVID symptoms, namely immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation, persistent viral reservoirs, vascular and endothelial dysfunction, and the disruption of the neurotransmitter signaling along various paths. We suggest that the nucleoprotein N of SARS-CoV-2 constitutes a “hub” between the virus and the host inflammation, immunity, and neurotransmission.">

        <tr id="Introduction Influenza virus infections are a major global health problem. Influenza can result in mild/moderate disease or progress to more severe disease, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Severity is thought to be primarily driven by immunopathology, but predicting which individuals are at a higher risk of being hospitalized warrants investigation into host genetics and the molecular signatures of the host response during influenza infections. Methods Here, we performed transcriptome and genotype analysis in healthy controls and patients exhibiting mild/moderate or severe influenza (ICU patients). A unique aspect of our study was the genotyping of all participants, which allowed us to assign ethnicities based on genetic variation and assess whether the variation was correlated with expression levels. Results We identified 169 differentially expressed genes and related molecular pathways between patients in the ICU and those who were not in the ICU. The transcriptome/genotype association analysis identified 871 genes associated to a genetic variant and 39 genes distinct between African-Americans and Caucasians. We also investigated the effects of age and sex and found only a few discernible gene effects in our cohort. Discussion Together, our results highlight select risk factors that may contribute to an increased risk of ICU admission for influenza-infected patients. This should help to develop better diagnostic tools based on molecular signatures, in addition to a better understanding of the biological processes in the host response to influenza.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="Mosquito borne flaviviruses, including dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, have caused global epidemics in areas with high HIV prevalence due to the expanded geographic range of arthropod vectors. Despite the occurrence of large flavivirus outbreaks in countries with high HIV prevalence, there is little knowledge regarding the effects of flavivirus infection in people living with HIV (PLWH). Here, we use a pigtail macaque model of HIV/AIDS to investigate the impact of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-induced immunosuppression on ZIKV replication and pathogenesis. Early acute SIV infection induced expansion of peripheral ZIKV cellular targets and increased innate immune activation and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SIV infected macaques were less permissive to ZIKV infection in vitro. In SIV-ZIKV co-infected animals, we found increased persistence of ZIKV in the periphery and tissues corresponding to alterations in innate cellular (monocytes, neutrophils) recruitment to the blood and tissues, decreased anti-ZIKV immunity, and chronic peripheral inflammatory and innate immune gene expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that untreated SIV infection may impair cellular innate responses and create an environment of chronic immune activation that promotes prolonged ZIKV viremia and persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. These results suggest that PLWH or other immunocompromised individuals could be at a higher risk for chronic ZIKV replication, which in turn could increase the timeframe of ZIKV transmission. Thus, PLWH are important populations to target during the deployment of vaccine and treatment strategies against ZIKV. Author Summary Flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), cause global epidemics in areas with high HIV prevalence. Yet questions remain as to whether ZIKV disease is altered during an immunocompromised state and the potential immune mechanisms contributing to enhanced disease. This is essential to our understanding of ZIKV disease in people living with HIV (PLWH). Here, we use a non-human primate (NHP) model of HIV/AIDS to investigate the impact of immune suppression on ZIKV replication and pathogenesis. The use of the NHP model was critical for the assessment of longitudinal specimens across tissues that are active sites of flavivirus replication and host immune responses. This study broadly demonstrates that ZIKV pathogenesis is altered and more persistent in states of immunosuppression. Collectively, this study suggests that in PLWH and immunocompromised individuals, other arboviruses, including dengue and West Nile viruses, could similarly alter pathogenesis and/or viral peristance in tissues. Furthermore, this study highlights the need to prioritize immunocompromised individuals in the design and rollout of vaccines against arboviral diseases.">

        <tr id="Background: A pandemic classification for COVID-19 was later issued. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was the cause of it. It spreads quickly and can result in severe respiratory failure at an early stage. Clinical research has demonstrated that the risk of infection is increased by both aging and chronic conditions. As such, blood group effects on the COVID-19 infection and its progression remain unknown. Aim: This study investigates possible relationships between patient blood group types, risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 in diabetic patients. Methodology: Age (41–60) was shown to be the age group most susceptible to infection with the SARS–COVID–19 virus, according to a statistical analysis of data from 90 individuals infected with COVID-19. Based on gender, the findings indicated that women had a greater incidence of diabetes than men did, with women having a 46% incidence of diabetes and men having a 44% infection rate. The blood types A and O were the most prevalent. According to the results of the current investigation, blood type O+ individuals had a higher prevalence of diabetes than blood type O-individuals. Based on gender, the findings indicated that women had a greater incidence of diabetes than men did, with women having a 46% incidence of diabetes and men having a 44% infection rate. Results: The results of the present study suggest that while blood group A might have a role in increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, blood group O might be somewhat protective. However, blood group type does not seem to influence clinical outcomes once infected.">

This review article is based on a comprehensive review of the wide range of symptoms most often observed in long COVID and an attempt to integrate that information into a plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of PASC. In particular, it is proposed that long-term dysregulation of the gut in response to viral persistence could lead to the myriad of symptoms observed in PASC.">

        <tr id="Immune profiling of Nipah virus (NiV) infection survivors is essential for advancing our understanding of NiV pathogenesis, improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and guiding public health efforts to prevent future outbreaks. There is currently limited data available on the immune response to NiV infection. We aimed to elucidate the specific immune mechanisms involved in protection against NiV infection by analyzing the immune profiles of survivors of the Nipah outbreak in Kerala, India 2023. Immune cell populations were quantified and compared between survivors (up to 4 months post onset day of illness) and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore associations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes. Immune signatures common to all three cases were: a heretofore undescribed persistent lymphopenia including the CD4+ Treg compartment with the relative expansion of memory Tregs; trends indicative of global leukopenic modulation were observed in monocytes and granulocytes including an expansion of putatively immunosuppressive low-density granulocytes described recently in the context of severe COVID-19; altered mucosal homing with respect to integrin beta-7 (ITGB7) expressing subsets; increased mobilization of activated T-cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and plasmablasts in the early phase of infection. Comparative analysis based on clinical presentation and outcome yielded lower initial viremia, increased activated T-cell responses, expanded plasmablasts, and restoration of ITGB7 expressing CD8+ T-cells as possible protective signatures. This longitudinal study delineates putative protective signatures associated with milder NiV disease. It emphasizes the need for the development of immunotherapeutic interventions such as monoclonal antibodies to blunt early viremia and ameliorate pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Viral infection of cells leads to metabolic changes, but how viral infection changes whole-body and tissue metabolism in vivo has not been comprehensively studied. In particular, it is unknown how metabolism might be differentially affected by an acute infection that the immune system can successfully clear, compared to a chronic and persistent infection. Here we used metabolomics and isotope tracing to identify metabolic changes in mice infected with acute or chronic forms of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) for three or eight days. Both types of infection alter metabolite levels in blood and tissues, including itaconate and thymidine. However, we observed more dramatic metabolite changes in the blood and tissues of mice with chronic LCMV infection compared to those with acute infection. Isotope tracing revealed that the contribution of both glucose and glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle increase in the spleen, liver, and kidneys of mice infected with chronic LCMV, while acute LCMV only increases the contribution of glutamine to the TCA cycle in the spleen. We found that whole-body turnover of both glutamine and thymidine increase during acute and chronic infection, whereas whole-body glucose turnover was surprisingly unchanged. Activated T cells in vitro produce thymidine and mice with T cell leukemia display elevated serum thymidine, nominating T lymphocytes as the source of thymidine in LCMV infection. In sum, we provide comprehensive measurements of whole-body and tissue metabolism in acute and chronic viral infection, and identify altered thymidine metabolism as a marker of viral infection.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is characterized by excessive inflammation leading to the development of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) derived from ω6 and ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are central to the regulation of inflammation, controlling both its initiation and resolution. Still, their role in COVID-19 remains underexplored. By employing a holistic approach involving the analysis of white blood cell transcriptomes, targeted lipidomics, cytokine and immune cell profiling, across the spectrum of disease severity groups, including mild non-hospitalized patients and healthy individuals, we now show that LM networks are profoundly altered in COVID-19, correlate with inflammatory patterns, and stratify patients according to disease severity. Central to this are CYP450-derived LMs such as 20-HETE, lipid peroxidation metabolites such as iPF2a-VI, and lipoxygenase-derived LMs such as 12-HETE, all of which are major vasoactive mediators of inflammation. Among them, 20-HETE appears to be a promising prognostic biomarker for ICU admission and a potential therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 disease. Our study thus underscores the significance of LM networks in COVID-19 pathophysiology and sheds light into the broader mechanisms driving viral pneumonia in humans.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses are a genus of small RNA viruses that are responsible for approximately one billion global infections annually. These infections range in severity from the common cold and flu-like symptoms to more severe diseases, such as viral myocarditis, pancreatitis, and neurological disorders, that continue to pose a global health challenge with limited therapeutic strategies currently available. In the current study, we sought to understand the interaction between coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which is a model enterovirus, and macrophage cells, as there is limited understanding of how this virus interacts with macrophage innate immune cells. Our study demonstrated that CVB3 can robustly activate macrophages without apparent viral replication in these cells. We also showed that myeloid cells lacked the viral entry receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, the expression of exogenous CAR in RAW264.7 macrophages was unable to overcome the viral replication deficit. Interestingly, the CAR expression was associated with altered inflammatory responses during prolonged infection. Additionally, we identified the autophagy protein LC3 as a novel stimulus for macrophage activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CVB3-induced macrophage activation and its implications for viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="IL-23 signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases, yet the cellular targets and signaling pathways affected by this cytokine remain poorly understood. We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Age-related susceptibility to sepsis and endotoxemia is poorly defined, although hyperactivation of the immune system and the expansion of the visceral adipose as an immunological reservoir are underlying features. Macrophages from older organisms exhibit substantial changes, including chronic NLRP3 inflammasome activation, genomic remodeling and a dysfunctional, amplified inflammatory response upon new exposure to pathogen. However, the mechanisms by which old macrophages maintain their inflammatory phenotype during endotoxemia remains elusive. We previously identified Gdf3, a TGFβ superfamily cytokine, as a top-regulated gene by age and the NLRP3 inflammasome in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Here, we demonstrate that endotoxemia increases inflammatory (CD11c+) ATMs in a Gdf3- dependent manner in old mice. Lifelong systemic or myeloid-specific deletion of Gdf3 leads to reduced endotoxemia- induced inflammation, with decreased CD11c+ ATMs and inflammatory cytokines, and protection from hypothermia. Moreover, acute blockade of Gdf3 using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, phenocopies old mice with lifelong Gdf3-deficiency. We show that GDF3 promotes the inflammatory phenotype in ATMs by phosphorylating SMAD2/3. Mechanistically, the differential chromatin landscape of ATMs from old mice with or without myeloid-driven Gdf3 indicates that GDF3- SMAD2/3 signaling axis shifts the chromatin accessibility of ATMs towards an inflammatory state during aging. Furthermore, pharmaceutical inhibition of SMAD3 with a specific inhibitor of SMAD3 (SIS3) mimics Gdf3 deletion. SIS3 reduces endotoxemia-mediated inflammation with fewer CD11c+ ATMs and less severe hypothermia in old, but not young mice, as well as reduced mortality. In human adipose tissue, age positively correlates with GDF3 level, while inflammation correlates with pSMAD2/3 level. Overall, these results highlight the importance of GDF3-SMAD2/3 axis in driving inflammation in older organisms and identify this signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating endotoxemia-related inflammation in the aged.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (CVOID-19) has varied clinical manifestations including mild to severe acute respiratory symptoms. Inflammasome complex and mitochondria play an important role in initiating inflammatory responses and could potentially be affected by this infection. To study the inflammasome and mitochondrial fission and fusion gene expression levels in COVID-19 patients, we designed this experiment. 
The inflammasome and mitochondrial gene expression profiles were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the peripheral blood of 70 hospitalized CVOID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms (HOSP) and 30 ICU patients with severe symptoms (ICU) compared to 20 healthy controls (HC). 
The results indicated that the expression of the dynamin-related protein-1 was extremely suppressed in HOSP while it came back to the normal range in the ICU group. However, the expression of fission 1 protein had a non-significant increase in HOSP and a decrease in the ICU group. The mitofusin-1 and dominant optic atrophy genes showed high expression levels (10-fold) and (70-fold), respectively, in the HOSP group. However, mitofusin-2 significantly decreased in both groups. Although leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 (NLRP3) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activating and recruitment domain genes dramatically increased in both groups (10 and 4-fold), other inflammasome genes declined in both groups. Finally, Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activate d B cells (NF-κB) extremely decreased, and Intreleukine-1 showed high expression in ICU patients (3-fold). 
CVOID-19 infection suppresses the fission genes and elevates the fusion gene expression in mitochondria, and it can cause activation of the inflammasome via the NLRP3 pathway.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Chemerin is an adipokine involved in inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and its circulating levels have been associated with inflammatory parameters in various patient cohorts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which causes COVID-19, triggers inflammatory pathways. However, the association between serum chemerin levels and COVID-19 disease severity and outcomes has not been definitively established. Methods: In this study, serum chemerin levels were analyzed in 64 patients with moderate COVID-19 and 60 patients with severe disease. Results: The results showed that serum chemerin levels were comparable between these two groups and slightly higher than in healthy controls. Notably, COVID-19 patients with hypertension exhibited elevated serum chemerin levels, while those with liver cirrhosis had lower levels. When patients with these comorbidities were excluded from the analyses, serum chemerin levels in COVID-19 patients were similar to those in healthy controls. Positive correlations were observed between serum chemerin levels and markers such as alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein, eosinophils, and lymphocytes in the entire cohort, as well as in the subgroup excluding patients with hypertension and cirrhosis. Additionally, urinary chemerin levels were comparable between COVID-19 patients and controls, and neither hypertension nor dialysis significantly affected urinary chemerin levels. Both survivors and non-survivors had similar serum and urinary chemerin levels. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study suggests that comorbidities such as arterial hypertension and liver cirrhosis do have a more significant impact on serum chemerin levels than SARS-CoV-2 infection itself.">

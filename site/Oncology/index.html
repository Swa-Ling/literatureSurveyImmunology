        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Myocarditis, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, can have multiple etiologies, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or, rarely, mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on left ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from patients with myocarditis unrelated to COVID-19 (Non-COVID-19), after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Post-COVID-19) and after COVID-19 vaccination (Post-Vaccination). We identified distinct cytokine expression patterns, with interferon-γ playing a key role in Post-COVID-19, and upregulated IL16 and IL18 expression serving as a hallmark of Post-Vaccination myocarditis. Although myeloid responses were similar across all groups, the Post-Vaccination group showed a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells, and the Post-COVID-19 group exhibited an expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T and natural killer cells. Endothelial cells showed gene expression changes indicative of vascular barrier dysfunction in the Post-COVID-19 group and ongoing angiogenesis across all groups. These findings highlight shared and distinct mechanisms driving myocarditis in patients with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T-cells are essential for controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet their antigen-specific resolution in relation to disease severity, functional dynamics during acute infection, and long-term memory formation remain incompletely understood. Using comprehensive longitudinal profiling of 553 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic antigens across globally prevalent HLAs, we identified antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses that were either critical for early viral clearance or associated with severe disease outcomes. During acute infection, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a broader and more robust CD8+ T-cell response than those with mild disease. Notably, we identified HLA-A1-restricted immunodominant antigen-specific T-cells strongly associated with severe disease. These T-cells were present at extremely high frequencies but showed significantly reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules at both the transcriptomic (PRF1, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY) and protein levels (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2), as revealed by multidimensional single-cell and cytokine profiling. In contrast, patients with mild disease had T-cells that recognized a more restricted set of antigens, showed only partial overlap with those in severe cases, and showed enhanced cytotoxicity, along with enrichment in gene sets associated with cytotoxic function, hypoxia, and glycolysis. Furthermore, the long-term memory CD8+ T-cells were maintained for a limited subset of immunodominant antigens, with their persistence correlating with their initial frequency during infection. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following infection expanded the long-term T-cell repertoire by enhancing pre-existing responses and generating de novo responses, regardless of prior disease severity. These findings resolve the antigen-specific kinetics and durability of CD8+ T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide key insights into their functional landscape. This knowledge could inform future vaccine strategies and therapeutic interventions to enhance protective immunity against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor that plays a role in orchestrating innate immune responses, particularly in response to viral infections. Notably, IRF5 has been identified as a microglia risk gene linked to multiple sclerosis (MS), but its specific role in MS pathogenesis remains unclear. Through the use of Irf5-/- mice, our study uncovers a non-canonical function of IRF5 in MS recovery. Irf5-/- mice exhibited increased damage in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and demonstrated impaired oligodendrocyte recruitment into the lesion core following lysolecithin-induced demyelination. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed that IRF5 has a role in microglia-mediated myelin phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol homeostasis. Indeed, Irf5-/- microglia phagocytose myelin, but myelin debris is not adequately degraded, leading to an accumulation of lipid droplets, cholesterol esters, and cholesterol crystals within demyelinating lesions. This abnormal buildup can hinder remyelination processes. Importantly, treatments that promote cholesterol transport were found to reduce lipid droplet accumulation and mitigate the exacerbated damage in Irf5-/- mice with EAE. Altogether, our study identified the antiviral transcription factor IRF5 as a key transcriptional regulator of lipid degradation and cholesterol homeostasis and suggest that loss of IRF5 function leads to pathogenic lipid accumulation in microglia, thereby obstructing remyelination. These data and the fact that Irf5 polymorphisms are significantly associated with MS, highlight IRF5 as a potential therapeutic target to promote regenerative responses.

        <tr id="Cerebral organoids (COs) are valuable tools for studying the intricate interplay between glial cells and neurons in brain development and disease, including HIV-associated neuroinflammation. We developed a novel approach to generate microglia containing COs (CO-iMs) by co-culturing hematopoietic progenitors and inducing pluripotent stem cells. This approach allowed for the differentiation of microglia within the organoids concomitantly with the neuronal progenitors. Compared with conventional COs, CO-iMs were more efficient at generating CD45+/CD11b+/Iba-1+ microglia and presented a physiologically relevant proportion of microglia (~ 7%). CO-iMs presented substantially increased expression of microglial homeostatic and sensome markers as well as markers for the complement cascade. CO-iMs are susceptible to HIV infection, resulting in a significant increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, which are abrogated by the addition of antiretrovirals. Thus, CO-iM is a robust model for deciphering neuropathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and viral infections of brain cells in a 3D culture system.

        <tr id="Regulator of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10), a key homeostatic regulator of immune cells, has been implicated in multiple diseases associated with aging and chronic inflammation including Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Interestingly, subjects with idiopathic PD display reduced levels of RGS10 in subsets of peripheral immune cells. Additionally, individuals with PD have been shown to have increased activated peripheral immune cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to age-matched healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether peripheral immune cells in the CSF of individuals with PD also exhibit decreased levels of RGS10. Utilizing the Michael J. Fox Foundation Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study we found that RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF of individuals with PD compared to healthy controls and prodromal individuals. As RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF and circulating peripheral immune cells of individuals with PD, we hypothesized that RGS10 regulates peripheral immune cell responses to chronic systemic inflammation (CSI) prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. To test this, we induced CSI for 6 weeks in C57BL6/J mice and RGS10 KO mice to assess circulating and CNS-associated immune cell responses. We found that RGS10 deficiency synergizes with CSI to induce a bias for inflammatory and cytotoxic cell populations, a reduction in antigen presentation machinery in peripheral blood immune cells, as well as in and around the brain that is most notable in males. These results highlight RGS10 as an important regulator of the systemic immune response to CSI and implicate RGS10 as a potential contributor to the development of immune dysregulation in PD.

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak revealed the susceptibility of elderly patients to respiratory virus infections, showing cell senescence or subclinical persistent inflammatory profiles and favoring the development of severe pneumonia. Methods In our study, we evaluated the potential influence of lung aging on the efficiency of replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as determining the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of the distal lung tissue. Results Using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from donors of different ages, we found that pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 IAV replicated in the lung parenchyma with high efficacy. In contrast to these IAV strains, SARS-CoV-2 Early isolate and Delta variant of concern (VOC) replicated less efficiently in PCLS. Interestingly, both viruses showed reduced replication in PCLS from older compared to younger donors, suggesting that aged lung tissue represents a suboptimal environment for viral replication. Regardless of the age-dependent viral loads, PCLS responded to H5N1 IAV infection by an induction of IL-6 and IP10/CXCL10, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and to H1N1 IAV infection by induction of IP10/CXCL10 mRNA. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 IAV infection were not causing detectable cell death, H5N1 IAV infection led to more cytotoxicity and induced significant early interferon responses. Conclusions In summary, our findings suggest that aged lung tissue might not favor viral dissemination, pointing to a determinant role of dysregulated immune mechanisms in the development of severe disease.

The FDA-approved coronavirus antiviral Paxlovid targets the essential SARS-CoV-2 main protease, Mpro.

Alternative antivirals that are addressing broader patient needs are urgently required.

Our lead compound shows excellent in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of severe acute disease. Importantly, our mouse model recapitulates long-term pathologies matching closely those seen in PASC patients. Our lead compound offers protection against a range of PASC symptoms in this model, prevents lung pathology and reduces brain dysfunction. This provides proof-of-principle that PLpro inhibition may have clinical relevance for PASC prevention and treatment going forward.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses are the most common cause of infectious encephalitis and highly target neurons for infection. Our understanding of the intrinsic capacity of neuronal innate immune responses to mediate protective antiviral responses remains incomplete. Here, we evaluated the role of intercellular crosstalk in mediating intrinsic neuronal immunity and its contribution to limiting viral infection. We found that in the absence of viral antagonism, neurons transcriptionally induce robust interferon signaling and can effectively signal to uninfected bystander neurons. Yet, in two-dimensional cultures, this dynamic response did not restrict viral spread. Interestingly, this differed in the context of viral infection in three-dimensional forebrain organoids with complex neuronal subtypes and cellular organization, where we observed protective capacity. We showed antiviral crosstalk between infected neurons and bystander neural progenitors is mediated by type I interferon signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we then uncovered regions containing bystander neural progenitors that expressed distinct antiviral genes, revealing critical underpinnings of protective antiviral responses among neuronal subtypes. These findings underscore the importance of interneuronal communication in protective antiviral immunity in the brain and implicate key contributions to protective antiviral signaling.

        <tr id="Common neurological symptoms of COVID-19, such as anosmia, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction, depend on interactions between the peripheral and central nervous systems. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections. Highlights iPSC technology was employed to generate peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a valuable platform for studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on peripheral sensory neurons. Our findings demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant exerted both direct and indirect effects on peripheral sensory neurons. Virus exposure upregulated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in peripherin-positive neurons. Additionally, exposure to the virus or its S1 spike protein increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression and trafficking, leading to axonal degeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that BA.5 exposure enhanced cAMP signaling pathway, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels that led to the significantly damage on synapses and axon guidance. The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited TRPV1 activation and mitigated axonal damage, offering neuroprotective effects for sensory neurons exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

Among healthy children and adolescents, younger age is associated with higher URT expression of innate and adaptive immune pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces broad upregulation of URT innate and adaptive immune responses among children and adolescents.

        <tr id="With the continuous emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, long-lasting and broadly reactive cellular and humoral immunity is critical for durable protection from COVID-19. We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in relation to antibodies, infection outcome and disease severity and assessed its durability in a longitudinal cohort over a three-year time course. We identified pre-existing T cells reactive to the seasonal coronavirus (CoV) OC43 that cross-react with the conserved SARS-CoV-2 spike S813-829 peptide. These cross-reactive T cells increased in frequency following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and correlated with enhanced spike-specific T cell responses and significantly reduced viral loads. Furthermore, our data revealed that CoV-cross-reactive T cells were maintained as part of the long-lasting memory response, contributing to increased T cell frequencies against omicron variants. These findings suggest a functional role of CoV-cross-reactive T cells that extends beyond the initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, contributing to enhanced immunity against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="Human microglial heterogeneity is only beginning to be appreciated at the molecular level. Here, we present a large, single-cell atlas of expression signatures from 441,088 live microglia broadly sampled across a diverse set of brain regions and neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases obtained from 161 donors sampled at autopsy or during a neurosurgical procedure. Using single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF), we derived a 23-factor model for continuous gene expression signatures across microglia which capture specific biological processes (e.g., metabolism, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, inflammatory signaling, disease-associated states). Using external datasets, we evaluated the aspects of microglial phenotypes that are encapsulated in various in vitro and in vivo microglia models and identified and replicated the role of two factors in human postmortem tissue of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Further, we derived a complex network of transcriptional regulators for all factors, including regulators of an AD-related factor enriched for the mouse disease-associated microglia 2 (DAM2) signature: ARID5B, CEBPA, MITF, and PPARG. We replicated the role of these four regulators in the AD-related factor and then designed a multiplexed MERFISH panel to assess our microglial factors using spatial transcriptomics. We find that, unlike cells with high expression of the interferon-response factor, cells with high expression of the AD DAM2-like factor are widely distributed in neocortical tissue. We thus propose a novel analytic framework that provides a taxonomic approach for microglia that is more biologically interpretable and use it to uncover new therapeutic targets for AD.">

        <tr id="Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities, making the advanced age as a major predictor of disease severity. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms explaining how old age represents a major risk factor remain elusive. To investigate this, we compared SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15–22 months) mice. Both groups of K18-ACE2 mice were intranasally infected with 500 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with analyses performed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infection (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, lung RNA-seq, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable differences, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance, reduced survival, and failure to recover weight loss due to infection. RNA-seq data suggested greater lung damage and reduced respiratory function in infected aged mice. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient antiviral response characterized by reduced Th1-associated mediators (IFNγ, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9) and diminished number of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. These findings indicate that aging affects antiviral immunity, leading to prolonged infection, greater lung damage, and poorer clinical outcomes. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.

        <tr id="Viral replication in endothelial cells is a hallmark of many viral diseases in humans and other animals, underscoring the importance of understanding cellular mechanisms that restrict viral replication and the associated consequences for vascular health. Pathogenic variants of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV, Isavirus salaris) target endothelial cells of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), causing severe systemic disease and major losses during outbreaks in aquaculture. To better understand the endothelial response to ISAV, we used single nucleus RNA-sequencing at pre-clinical (12 days post infection, dpi) and clinical (16 dpi) stages of infection. Our approach enables an assessment of transcriptomic responses for different endothelial subpopulations at unprecedented resolution. ISAV RNA was predominantly detected in endothelial cells, which, along with mononuclear phagocytes, showed the highest number of differentially regulated genes at both time points. At 12 dpi, differentially expressed genes in endothelial cells were enriched for pathways related to NOD-like receptor signaling, antiviral responses, and regulation of programmed cell death. By 16 dpi, we observed a shift toward enrichment of pathways associated with cellular senescence, apelin signaling, and insulin signaling. We identified two distinct infection-related states at both time points: a virus-permissive state characterized by upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, small GTPase signaling, and MAPK activity, and a bystander phenotype marked by activation of antiviral responses, immune signaling, and translational regulation. This study is the first to capture the individual cell type responses to ISAV infection, and to characterize the in vivo endothelial response to active viral replication at single-cell resolution in any species.">

        <tr id="The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it critical to understand the immune and inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It became increasingly recognized that the immune response was a key mediator of illness severity and that its mechanisms needed to be better understood. Early infection of both tissue and immune cells, such as macrophages, leading to pyroptosis-mediated inflammasome production in an organ system critical for systemic oxygenation likely plays a central role in the morbidity wrought by SARS-CoV-2. Delayed transcription of Type I and Type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to early disinhibition of viral replication. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), some of which may be produced through mechanisms involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), likely contribute to the hyperinflammatory state in patients with severe COVID-19. Lymphopenia, more apparent among natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells, can contribute to disease severity and may reflect direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 or end-organ sequestration. Direct infection and immune activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may be a critical mechanism through which end-organ systems are impacted. In this context, endovascular neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and microthrombi development can be seen in the lungs and other critical organs throughout the body, such as the heart, gut, and brain. The kidney may be among the most impacted extrapulmonary organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to a high concentration of ACE2 and exposure to systemic SARS-CoV-2. In the kidney, acute tubular injury, early myofibroblast activation, and collapsing glomerulopathy in select populations likely account for COVID-19-related AKI and CKD development. The development of COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), in particular, may be mediated through IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suggesting a direct connection between the COVID-19-related immune response and the development of chronic disease. Chronic manifestations of COVID-19 also include systemic conditions like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which may reflect a spectrum of clinical presentations of persistent immune dysregulation. The lessons learned and those undergoing continued study likely have broad implications for understanding viral infections’ immunologic and inflammatory consequences beyond coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer-and region-specificity. In Parkinson’s disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance. COVID-19 brains displayed extensive peripheral immune cell infiltration, particularly in the subcortical white matter, accompanied by compromised blood-brain barrier and coordinated neuroinflammatory responses from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells.

        <tr id="The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is highly heterogeneous, with interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression playing a dual role in antiviral defense and immune dysregulation. To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism implicated in cardiac infection in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible.">

        <tr id="HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) cause significant dysfunction among people living with HIV. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system and are readily infected by HIV. Microglia are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HAND. In order to identify pathways that may contribute to neuropathogenesis in HAND, we infected induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) with HIV and defined gene expression changes over an 8-day period. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were studied in parallel in order to identify common pathways stimulated in myeloid cells versus the unique aspects of microglia infection. Infection of iMG led to the induction of a robust early inflammatory response triggered within hours of infection, a pattern that differed significantly from that seen in MDMs. Remarkably, gene expression changes in iMG reproduced many of the characteristic genetic signatures previously identified in brain tissues obtained from individuals clinically diagnosed with HAND. Inflammatory activation representing interferon-mediated signaling, TNF/NF-κB, and IL-6/JAK/STAT pathways were particularly prominent over the time course of infection. Interferon-mediated signaling led to enhanced expression of multiple HIV restriction factors, yet viral replication in iMG remained robust. These findings suggest that HIV infection of microglia is the key cellular driver of neuroinflammation in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals. Further studies of infected microglia are likely to aid in understanding the pathogenesis of HAND and in evaluating therapeutic strategies to limit or eliminate HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. Author Summary Persons living with HIV frequently develop debilitating problems with brain function that are collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Treatment with antiretroviral drugs to control HIV has largely eliminated the most severe form of HIV-related brain dysfunction, HIV encephalitis, but a significant proportion of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiviral therapy still develop significant problems with cognitive function. Microglia are the major macrophage-like cells of the brain and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Inflammation in the brain following infection contributes to damage to neurons and is the likely source of decline of brain function. This study used microglia that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, termed iMG, to study the kinetics of gene expression changes in HIV-infected microglia, and compared those changes to those seen in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). iMG were found to be easily infected with a macrophage-tropic HIV strain and exhibited a rapid increase in gene expression associated with inflammatory signaling through interferon- and tumor necrosis factor/NF-kappa B-mediated pathways. Remarkably, the patterns of gene expression in microglia strongly overlapped with gene expression signatures derived from brain tissue samples of HIV patients with HAND. The rapid onset and magnitude of inflammation as well as induction of specific HIV restriction factors differed from that seen in infected macrophages/MDMs. These studies reinforce the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of HAND and provide insights into HIV-microglia interactions that can help direct interventions to reduce inflammation and preserve brain function.">

        <tr id="Introduction Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing immune responses against pathogens. The fluctuation of Treg proportions in COVID-19 remains a topic of debate, and the mechanisms triggering Treg activation in COVID-19 are still unclear. Understanding these issues is essential for better managing immune responses in COVID-19 patients. Methods We collected a cohort of COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity and stage to explore the transcriptomic and functional traits of Tregs in these individuals. Using transcriptomic analysis, we evaluated the proportion and functionality of different Treg subsets, specifically HLA_DR+ Tregs, across different stages of COVID-19 patients. Results Our analysis revealed that the proportion of CCR7 + Tregs decreased as the disease advanced, while the cell proportion of HLA_DR+ regs escalated with the severity of the disease. Moreover, the transcription actor CARHSP1 exhibited apositive correlation with the proportion of HLA_DR+ Tregs. Notably, the heightened suppressive function of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients, with interactions between PF4 and CXCR3, contributed to the homeostasis of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that Tregs in COVID-19 patients exhibited weakened TCR clonotype expansion, and the suppression of HLA_DR+ Tregs with expanded TCR clonotypes in severe COVID-19 cases did not show a significant increase compared to asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 groups. The findings indicate that Tregs may be activated through the bystander effect, as evidenced by the analysis of TCR clonotype characteristics. Discussion Our research delineates the diversity of dynamic alterations in Tregs and sheds light on potential mechanisms underlying Treg activation, providing a theoretical foundation and offering treatment strategies for managing COVID-19 patients.">

The differences between animal models and humans contribute to inefficiencies in drug development, highlighting the need for more relevant and predictive, non-animal models. In this context, AlveolAir™, a fully primary in vitro 3D human alveolar model, was characterized and demonstrated the sustained presence of alveolar type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) cells. This model exhibited a functional barrier over a 30-day period, evidenced by high transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). These findings were further validated by tight junctions’ confocal microscopy and low permeability to Lucifer yellow, confirming AlveolAir™ as robust platform for drug transport assays. Additionally, successful infections with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses were achieved, and antiviral treatments with Baloxavir and Remdesivir, respectively, effectively reduced viral replication. Interestingly, both viruses infected only the epithelial layer without replicating in endothelial cells. These findings indicate AlveolAir™ as a relevant model for assessing the toxicity and permeability of xenobiotics and evaluating the efficacy of novel antiviral therapies.">

Analysis of human CD14+CD16+ monocytes matured in vitro by single-cell RNA sequencing identified a heterogenous population of nine clusters. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in each cluster identified increased migratory and inflammatory pathways for a group of clusters, which we termed Group 1 monocytes. Group 1 monocytes, distinguished by increased ALCAM, CD52, CD63, and SDC2, exhibited gene expression signatures implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases, produced higher levels of CXCL12, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and ROS, and preferentially transmigrated across a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model. Thus, Group 1 cells within the CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset are likely to be major contributors to neuroinflammatory diseases.">

Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1–/– mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1–/– animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng–/– mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1–/– animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

While the mechanisms of programmed cell death (PCD) in COVID-19 and sepsis are complex, understanding the molecular markers involved in these processes may aid in assessing disease severity. This study aimed to investigate the roles of PCD markers, inflammatory cytokines, and MHC molecules in distinguishing disease severity in COVID-19 patients with and without sepsis. Methods The study involved adult patients (≥18 years) who survived COVID-19, grouped into four cohorts: COVID-19 with sepsis (C19wSepsis), COVID-19 without sepsis (C19NoSepsis), sepsis alone, and healthy controls. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each cohort were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. PCD markers (caspase-3, caspase-1, MLKL, LC3B, p62/SQSTM1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma), and MHC molecules (MHC I-A, MHC II-DRB1) were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate differences in marker levels between and within cohorts. Results The analysis identified two distinct molecular signatures associated with disease severity. The first signature, characterized by elevated levels of secreted markers of PCD, IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma, MHC I-A and MHC II-DRB1, was common to the C19wSepsis and C19NoSepsis cohorts. The second signature, which was more prominent in the cellular markers of PCD (caspase-1, caspase-3, MLKL, p62/SQSTM1), was uniquely associated with the C19wSepsis cohort. Conclusion These findings provide insight into the molecular signatures distinguishing immune responses in COVID-19-related sepsis and may serve as valuable biomarkers for assessing disease severity, while guiding therapeutic interventions in critical care settings.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells remains very limited. The contributions of intracellular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also unclear. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for IGFBP2, specifically in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2), in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we show that IGFBP2 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in primary AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions from patients with COVID-19-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alone or IPF with a history of COVID-19. Using multicolor immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 and its selective ligands IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly reduced in AEC2 cells from patients with COVID-ARDS, IPF alone, or IPF with COVID history than in those from age-matched donor controls. Further, we demonstrated that lentiviral expression of Igfbp2 significantly reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines—Tnf-α, Il1β, Il6, Stat3, Stat6 and chemokine receptors—Ccr2 and Ccr5—in mouse lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injury (S2; 500 ng/mL). Finally, we demonstrated higher levels of cytokines—TNF-α; IL-6 and chemokine receptor—CCR5 in AEC2 cells from COVID-ARDS patients compared to the IPF alone and the IPF with COVID history patients. Altogether, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IGFBP2 in AEC2 cells and its localized delivery may serve as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with COVID-19.

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have emerged. Although the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the lungs, it can also affect the brain and induce neurological symptoms. However, the specific effects of different variants on the brain remain unclear. In this study, a whole-transcriptome analysis was conducted using the brain tissues of K18-hACE2 mice infected with the ancestral B.1 (Wuhan) variant and with major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.529 (Omicron). After sequencing, differential gene expression, gene ontology (GO) and genome pathway enrichment analyses were performed. An Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) was used to identify the abundance of different cell populations. Additionally, RT-qPCR was used to validate the RNA-seq data. The viral load and hierarchical clustering analyses divided the samples into two different clusters with notable differences in gene expression at day 6 post-infection for all variants compared to the control group. GO and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analyses revealed similar patterns of pathway enrichment for different variants. ImmuCellAI revealed the changes in immune cell populations, including the decrease in CD4+ T and B cell proportions and the increase in CD8+ T and dendritic cell proportions. A co-expression network analysis revealed that some genes, such as STAT1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), were dysregulated in all variants. A RT-qPCR analysis for IL-6, CXCL10 and IRF7 further validated the RNA-seq analysis. In conclusion, this study provides, for the first time, an extensive transcriptome analysis of a K18-hACE2 mouse brain after infection with major SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life [1]. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells, and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV infected and bystander activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing. Importance Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and functional genomics to understand the host response in both RSV infected and bystander cells, identify what host factors mediate infection, and contextualize these findings relative to dozens of previously reported screens across 17 additional viruses.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes epidemics with high mortality; however, effective vaccines and therapies remain missing. Here, we depict a temporal single-cell landscape of primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) exposed to three different virulent ASFV strains in vitro. We found that attenuated and low-virulence ASFV strains tend to exhibit higher viral loads than highly virulent strain, which may result from upregulated RNA polymerase subunit genes expression. On the host side, our study highlights the IRF7-mediated positive feedback loop to the activation of the interferon signaling pathway in cells exposed to attenuated and low virulent ASFV strains. Moreover, we unraveled the PAMs populations marked by expressions of the IFI16 and CD163, respectively, which produce high levels of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and IL18 to regulate the host response to different virulent ASFV strains. Collectively, our data provide insights into the complex host-virus interactions with various ASFV strain infections, which may shed light on the development of effective antiviral strategies. IMPORTANCE There is still no available research on the temporal transcriptional profile of host cells exposed to different virulent ASFV strains at the single-cell level. Here, we first profiled the temporal viral and host transcriptomes in PAMs exposed to high virulent, attenuated virulent, and low virulent ASFV strains. Our analysis revealed that attenuated and low-virulence ASFV strains tend to exhibit higher viral loads than highly virulent strains, which may result from upregulated RNA polymerase subunit genes expression. We also found a positive feedback loop of the interferon signaling pathway mediated through IRF7 and identified the populations of PAMs marked by IFI6 and CD163, respectively, which produce high levels of ISGs and IL18 to regulate host response to different virulent ASFV strains. Our study delineated a comprehensive single-cell landscape of host-virus dynamics across ASFV strains with different virulences and would provide an important resource for future research.">

        <tr id="Background HIV-1-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-1-NCI) is marked by ongoing and chronic neuroinflammation with loss and decline in neuronal function even when antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) successfully suppresses viral replication. Microglia, the primary reservoirs of HIV-1 in the central nervous system (CNS), play a significant role in maintaining this neuroinflammatory state. However, understanding how chronic neuroinflammation is generated and sustained by HIV-1, or impacted by ART, is difficult due to limited access to human CNS tissue. Methods We generated an in vitro model of admixed hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) derived microglia embedded into embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived Brain Organoids (BO). Microglia were infected with HIV-1 prior to co-culture. Infected microglia were co-cultured with brain organoids BOs to infiltrate the BOs and establish a model for HIV-1 infection, “HIV-1 M-BO”. HIV-1 M-BOs were treated with ART for variable directions. HIV-1 infection was monitored with p24 ELISA and by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Inflammation was measured by cytokine or p-NF-kB levels using multiplex ELISA, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results HIV-1 infected microglia could be co-cultured with BOs to create a model for “brain” HIV-1 infection. Although HIV-1 infected microglia were the initial source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, astrocytes, neurons and neural stem cells also had increased p-NF-kB levels, along with elevated CCL2 levels in the supernatant of HIV-1 M-BOs compared to Uninfected M-BOs. ART suppressed the virus to levels below the limit of detection but did not decrease neuroinflammation. Conclusions These findings indicate that HIV-1 infected microglia are pro-inflammatory. Although ART significantly suppressed HIV-1 levels, neuronal inflammation persisted in ART-treated HIV-1 M-BOs. Together, these findings indicate that HIV-1 infection of microglia infiltrated into BOs provides a robust in vitro model to understand the impact of HIV-1 and ART on neuroinflammation.

        <tr id="Viral infections induce major shifts in cellular metabolism elicited by active viral replication and antiviral responses. For the virus, harnessing cellular metabolism and evading changes that limit replication are essential for productive viral replication. In contrast, the cellular response to infection disrupts metabolic pathways to prevent viral replication and promote an antiviral state in the host cell and neighboring bystander cells. This competition between the virus and cell results in measurable shifts in cellular metabolism that differ depending on the virus, cell type, and extracellular environment. The resulting metabolic shifts can be observed and analyzed using global metabolic profiling techniques to identify pathways that are critical for either viral replication or cellular defense. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus that can exhibit broad tissue tropism and diverse, yet inconsistent, symptomatology. While the factors that determine the presentation and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear, metabolic syndromes are associated with more severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Despite these observations a critical knowledge gap remains between cellular metabolic responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a well-established untargeted metabolomics analysis workflow, we compared SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung carcinoma cells. We identified significant changes in metabolic pathways that correlate with either productive or non-productive viral infection. This information is critical for characterizing the factors that contribute to SARS-CoV-2 replication that could be targeted for therapeutic interventions to limit viral disease.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial disease involving genetic and environmental factors, including viral infection. We investigated the impact of interferon alpha (IFN-α), a cytokine produced during the immune response to viral infection or the presence of un-edited endogenous double-stranded RNAs, on human β-cell physiology. Intravital microscopy on transplanted human islets using a β-cell-selective reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosensor (RIP1-GRX1-roGFP2), revealed a subset of human β-cells that acutely produce ROS in response to IFN-α. Comparison to Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP) phenotypic data revealed that healthier donors had more ROS accumulating cells. In vitro IFN-α treatment of human islets similarly elicited a heterogenous increase in superoxide production that originated in the mitochondria. To determine the unique molecular signature predisposing cells to IFN-α stimulated ROS production, we flow sorted human islets treated with IFN-α. RNA sequencing identified genes involved in inflammatory and immune response in the ROS-producing cells. Comparison with single cell RNA-Seq datasets available through the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP) showed that genes upregulated in ROS-producing cells are enriched in control β-cells rather than T1D donors. Combined, these data suggest that IFN-α stimulates mitochondrial ROS production in healthy human β-cells, potentially predicting a more efficient antiviral response.">

However, the mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain unclear. We show that post-ZIKV infection IgA antibodies in serum targeting the DENV2 nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) drive neutrophil activation and correlate with increased risk of a subsequent severe DENV2 infection in a pediatric cohort study. Increased neutrophil degranulation correlated with IgA binding to DENV2 NS1 and preceded vascular leakage in paired acute-phase samples from the same individuals and in dengue patients after prior ZIKV infection in an orthogonal hospital-based study. Thus, serum anti-NS1 IgA enhances neutrophil activation in severe dengue, with implications for prognostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Background The mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after non-severe COVID-19 remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood cells of patients with post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) and assess if distinct clinical subtypes with specific gene signatures could be identified. Methods The cohort included 111 PCC patients from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant era, with 57 recovered (Recov) and 54 having prolonged symptoms indicative of PCC. The results were compared to 63 healthy controls (Ctrl) without known SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data included patient assessments, laboratory results, comorbidities, and questionnaires on quality of life and functioning. Transcriptomic analysis and cellular deconvolution methods were used on total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results PCC patients had more comorbidities (mean 1.3) and more frequently (59%) at least one comorbidity than recovered patients (31%) and controls (24%). Overall, past COVID-19 illness or current PCC symptoms caused minimal changes in the blood cell transcriptome, with only 3–6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified across comparisons. However, a subset of male PCC patients exhibited an increased fraction of deconvoluted erythroblasts and significant genome-wide gene expression changes, with 399 DEGs compared to recovered and control males. These genes were enriched in pathways related to heme metabolism and gas exchange in erythrocytes. Conclusions Persistent symptoms in PCC are multifactorial and not directly linked to peripheral blood cell gene expression changes. However, a subgroup of male PCC patients shows distinct erythrocyte responses that may contribute to long-term symptoms.">

        <tr id="Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a pathogen that is capable of colonizing various infection sites and can potentially elicit an inadequate immune response that will lead to sepsis. The processes underlying this misdirected immune reaction remain poorly understood, and reliable biomarkers for indicating impending organ failure during sepsis are still missing. The present study aims to identify parameters that can predict the onset of end-organ damage in the course of sepsis. To that extent, we investigated key aspects of the immune response in early-phase sepsis following infection of different tissues in a mouse model, using Brefeldin A to link cytokine production to specific cell types through multi-parameter flow cytometry. Subcutaneous and intravenous GAS infections resulted in clinical sepsis, which was paralleled by peripheral blood lymphopenia. Intravenous infection in particular was associated with a higher bacterial burden in the liver that strongly correlated with an increased granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio of the peripheral blood. Strikingly, IL-6 overexpression was more pronounced in intravenous infection and strongly correlated with hepatic stress, indicated by elevated bacterial loads in the liver. Collectively, our data highlight the potential utility of IL-6 in conjunction with an elevated granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio as promising early indicators of concomitant liver stress in sepsis.

Nonetheless, the molecular pathway behind neurological pathology and the presumed neurotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains largely unexplored. We generated human cortical organoids (HCOs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to assess: (1) the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 main entry factors; (2) their vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; and (3) the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to the Spike protein on their transcriptome. Results proved that (1) HCOs express the main SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors and co‐receptors; (2) HCOs may be productively infected by SARS‐CoV‐2; (3) the viral particles released by SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected HCOs are able to re‐infect another cellular line; and (4) the infection resulted in the activation of apoptotic and stress pathways, along with inflammatory processes. Notably, these effects were recapitulated when HCOs were exposed to the Spike protein alone. The data obtained demonstrate that SARS‐CoV‐2 likely infects HCOs probably through the binding of ACE2, CD147, and NRP1 entry factors. Furthermore, exposure to the Spike protein alone proved sufficient to disrupt their homeostasis and induce neurotoxic effects, potentially contributing to the onset of long‐COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="Introduction Hematogenous disseminated tuberculosis (DTB) has an unclear etiology that likely involves multiple factors. Understanding the underlying immunological characteristics of DTB is crucial for elucidating its pathogenesis. Methods We conducted single-cell RNA transcriptome and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on samples from seven DTB patients. Additionally, we integrated and analyzed data from two published profiles of latent TB infection, three active TB cases, and two healthy controls. Results Our analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of inflammatory immune cells (e.g., monocytes and macrophages) in DTB patients, along with a notably lower abundance of various lymphocytes (including T cells, B cells, and plasma cells), suggesting that lymphopenia is a prominent feature of the disease. T cell pseudotime analysis indicated a decrease in the expression of most hypervariable genes over time, pointing to T cell functional exhaustion. Furthermore, a marked absence of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells was observed in the peripheral blood of DTB patients. In the TCR repertoire, specific polymorphisms (TRAV9-2, TRAV13-1, TRBV20-1, and TRBV5-1) and dominant clones (TRAJ49, TRBJ2-7, and TRBJ2-1) were identified. Analysis of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) showed that the most frequent combination was TRAV1-2/TRAJ33, with the motif “CAAMD” being significantly reduced in DTB patients. Discussion These findings suggest that lymphopenia and T cell exhaustion, along with unique TCR signatures, may play critical roles in DTB pathogenesis. The reduced “CAAMD” motif and altered TCR clonotypes provide novel insights into the complex cellular dynamics associated with the disease, potentially offering new avenues for targeted immunological interventions.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Dendritic cells (DCs) in severe cases exhibited reduced proportions and attenuated expression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86), alongside increased cytochrome c expression, indicating impaired antigen presentation and enhanced apoptosis. NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by demyelination and neuroinflammation, with oxidative stress playing a pivotal role in lesion pathology. This study aimed to investigate the differential cellular responses to myelin debris under varying oxidative states. Myelin oxidation was induced using a Cu–peroxide system, confirmed by elevated TBARS levels and autofluorescence. BV-2 microglia viability remained unaffected by myelin exposure. However, oxidized myelin significantly altered oxidative stress markers, autophagy, and iron metabolism, as evidenced by changes in Sod2, Tfr1, p62, and P-Erk/Erk ratios. Morphological analyses revealed time- and dose-dependent differences in myelin processing, with oxidized myelin leading to distinct phagosome dynamics. Complementary studies using induced microglia-like cells (iMG)—a primary cell culture—confirmed the feasibility of employing oxidized microglia to study microglia activity. The use of iMGs provides a model closer to patient physiology, offering the potential to evaluate individual cellular responses to oxidative damage. This approach could be instrumental in identifying personalized therapeutic strategies by assessing patient-specific microglial behavior in response to myelin debris. These findings highlight the impact of myelin oxidative status on microglial function, advancing the understanding of oxidative stress in MS and paving the way for personalized medicine applications in neuroinflammation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Type I interferons exert their antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including but not limited to LY6E, CH25H, IFITM2/3, and IFIH1. However, the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of action of most ISGs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet fully understood. By screening 109 ISG-knockout cell lines, we identify that phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an interferon-inducible protein, acts as a crucial restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells lacking PLSCR1 are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, overexpression of PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depletion of PLSCR1 enhances cellular entry of both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by specifically downregulating plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the virus’s receptor, without affecting the overall levels of ACE2 within the cell. As such, we unraveled previously unappreciated mechanisms by which PLSCR1 exerts its restrictive effect on SARS-CoV-2. These data provide new insights into the interplay between host innate antiviral immunity and SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on novel antiviral therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been identified as a critical host restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we demonstrated that PLSCR1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry by downregulating the plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for viral entry. Our findings elucidate a novel host-pathogen interaction that not only deepens our understanding of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 but offers potential strategies for therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background The T cell compartment undergoes significant age-related changes, contributing to the decline of the adaptive immune system and increasing the risk of suboptimal antibody responses to vaccines in older adults. To better understand the association between T cell phenotypes and vaccine responsiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of CD4+, CD8+, and γδ + T cells on VITAL cohort participants who are low or high responders to multiple vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and SARS-CoV-2). Results Using spectral cytometry and FlowSOM, we identified detailed phenotypes of naïve, regulatory, and terminally differentiated T cells. We observed that the percentages of CD31 + naïve CD4+, CD31 + naïve CD8+, and CD38 + naïve CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in low vaccine responders. Notably, CD31 + naïve T cell subsets showed a stronger correlation with immune entropy, a measure of cumulative immune system perturbations, than with age itself. Conclusions These findings suggest that subsets of naïve cells could be associated with weak vaccine responsiveness and immunosenescence. Furthermore, these naive T cell signatures could help predict weak vaccine responses, potentially informing targeted vaccination strategies in older adults.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron has demonstrated decreased pathogenicity, yet a few individuals suffer severe pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection; the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Methods The present work investigated the role of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the occurrence and progression of severe Omicron infection. The expression and dynamic changes of ISGs were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the anti-ISG15 autoantibody in infected patients was detected by ELISA. Moreover, we evaluated the correlation of ISGs with disease severity and outcomes by comparing expression of ISGs among each group. Results Decreased expression of several ISGs such as IFI6 are potentially linked to increased severity or poor outcomes of Omicron infection. Longitudinal data also demonstrates that the dynamic variation of IFI6 in the Omicron infection phase may be linked to the prognosis of the disease. The increase of anti-ISG15 autoantibody potentially links to the disease progression and poor outcome of patients with high level of ISG15 expression. Conclusions These findings define aberrant Interferon-stimulated gene associated host responses and reveal potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets for Omicron or other viral infection.">

        <tr id="Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.">

        <tr id="Adult stem cell therapy holds great promise for treating decompensated liver cirrhosis on the basis of animal studies, despite uncertainty about its clinical therapeutic efficacy and unclear underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigated the role of follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), a profibrotic and proinflammatory matricellular protein, in inflammation-related heterogeneity in stem cell therapy. Our results showed that a high level of circulating FSTL1 is significantly correlated with therapeutic response in patients with cirrhosis. FSTL1 facilitated MSC-mediated early recruitment of Ly6C+ inflammatory macrophages within 24 h postinfusion, which was essential for the empowerment of MSCs and subsequent Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage remodelling at 48 h postinfusion. Fstl1 deficiency abrogated early macrophage recruitment and effective Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage accumulation, resulting in the poor antifibrotic effect of MSCs in mice. Whereas, recombinant FSTL1 protein restored the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in CCl4-injured Fstl1+/− mice. Mechanistically, host FSTL1 enhanced rapid recycling of CCR2 to the membrane via activation of the CD14/TLR4/NF-κB/ATP6V1G2 axis, leading to early recruitment of Ly6C+ monocytes /macrophages. Taken together, our findings revealed that FSTL1 is a critical regulator of the fibrotic immune microenvironment and facilitates subsequent stem cell therapy. These data suggest that FSTL1 could serve as a predictive biomarker of stem cell therapy response in patients with liver cirrhosis.">

        <tr id="HIV infection exerts profound and long-lasting neurodegenerative effects on the central nervous system (CNS) that can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we used single-nucleus multiome sequencing to map the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of postmortem human brains from 13 healthy individuals and 20 individuals with HIV who have a history of treatment with ART. Our study spanned three distinct regions—the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and ventral striatum—enabling a comprehensive exploration of region-specific and cross-regional perturbations. We found widespread and persistent HIV-associated transcriptional and epigenetic alterations across multiple cell types. Detailed analyses of microglia revealed state changes marked by immune activation and metabolic dysregulation, while integrative multiomic profiling of astrocytes identified multiple subpopulations, including a reactive subpopulation unique to HIV-infected brains. These findings suggest that cells from people with HIV exhibit molecular shifts that may underlie ongoing neuroinflammation and CNS dysfunction. Furthermore, cell–cell communication analyses uncovered dysregulated and pro-inflammatory interactions among glial populations, underscoring the multifaceted and enduring impact of HIV on the brain milieu. Collectively, our comprehensive atlas of HIV-associated brain changes reveals distinct glial cell states with signatures of pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic dysregulation, providing a framework for developing targeted therapies for HIV-associated neurological dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are known to impact cellular and humoral immune response in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). In this study, we performed in-depth SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell profiling using flow cytometry. T-cell immunity in pwMS with or without DMTs was evaluated before a first SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccination and at one-, two- and six-month follow-up. T-cell stimulation without SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens was used as a control. T-cell response was compared to B-cell response by evaluating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We observed an upregulation of specific subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, our results demonstrate the induction of a broad and distinct CD4+ T-cell response in pwMS even on anti-CD20 treatment and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. This was particularly seen in CD4+high and CD4+CD154+ T cells. Our results do not support the induction of a CD8+ T-cell immune response. While humoral immune response was impaired in pwMS during ocrelizumab and fingolimod treatment, there was evidence of a compensatory upregulation of subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells at low levels of seroconversion in pwMS. In conclusion, our results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the adaptive immune response in pwMS following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.">

        <tr id="The upper airway epithelium is the primary site of exposure to Bordetella pertussis and the initiator of host responses to this microbe. B. pertussis may cause serious respiratory infections resulting in major complications, as well as severe impairment of airway function. While pertussis treatment options are limited because the molecular responses in the upper respiratory tract in the early stages of infection have not been characterized. Here, we performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of nasal turbinates isolated from mice over 11 days after B. pertussis infection. Using RNA-seq, we characterized the differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with the changes in the nasal turbinates following infection. Statistical analysis revealed that infection is a dynamic process characterized by increased expression of a set of acute inflammatory responses at an early stage. After this initial inflammatory response, we observed increases in the levels of transcripts associated with the regulation of immune processes. In particular, we found that B. pertussis infection significantly increased the levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and related genes in the nasal turbinates at 2 h, 2 days, and 4 days postinfection. Therefore, we investigated the role of type I IFNs in B. pertussis infection in type I IFNs receptor-deficient (IFNAR1−/−) mice. There was no difference in bacterial clearance or adaptive immune responses between wild-type and IFNAR1−/− mice. However, a lack of type I IFNs signaling ameliorated pulmonary immunopathology, reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and limited the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung during B. pertussis infection. Thus, our findings suggest that inhibiting the effects of type I IFNs may contribute to dampening inflammation, which could be an approach for the treatment of B. pertussis infection and management of the associated disease symptoms.">

        <tr id="Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs’ functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, FCGRT gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of FCGRT showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, TRIM21 transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in TRIM21 transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors DDX58 and IFIH1, the transcriptional level of inflammatory IL1B and IL18 was generally very low, along with the NLRP3 danger sensor, members of the NF-κB pathway, and TNF. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.">

        <tr id="In this study, the critical role of the epipharynx in managing long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and in particular, how residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA affects signalling pathways in the epipharynx were investigated via spatial gene expression analysis (Visium HD). Moreover, we hypothesize that epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) targeting the epipharynx could improve long COVID symptoms by modulating local inflammation and gene expression. We conducted a comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles of three patients with long COVID and two control individuals without COVID-19. Residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the epipharynx of patients with long COVID, along with the activation of signalling pathways in epithelial and immune cells. After EAT, the viral RNA was either completely cleared or significantly reduced. T-cell receptor signalling pathways were suppressed; the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α, were reduced; and excessive antibody production was mitigated. Histology showed that EAT effectively eliminated the inflamed, dysfunctional ciliated epithelium. This study clarifies that SARS-CoV-2 has long-term effects on the immune response in the epipharynx, emphasizing the need to focus on chronic epipharyngitis as a potential cause of long COVID. Furthermore, EAT may offer a promising approach to alleviating persistent long COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection widely induces antibody response targeting diverse viral proteins, including typical representative N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), and S2 subunit of spike. A lot of NTD-, RBD-, and S2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been isolated from COVID-19 convalescents, some of which displaying potent activities to inhibit viral infection. However, a small portion of NTD-specific mAbs elicited by wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 primary infection could facilitate the virus entry into target cells in vitro, so called NTD-targeting infection-enhancing antibodies (NIEAs). To date, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to massive variants carrying various NTD mutations, especially recent Omicron BA.2.86 and JN.1. In this study, we investigated whether these WT-NIEAs could still enhance the infectivity of emerging Omicron variants. Nine novel WT-NIEAs with diverse germline gene usage were identified from 3 individuals, effectively enlarging available antibody panel of NIEAs. Bivalent binding of NIEAs to inter-spike contributed to their infection-enhancing activities. WT-NIEAs could enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged before Omicron, but ineffective to Omicron variants including BA.2.86 and JN.1, which was because of their changed antigenicity of NTDs. Overall, these data clearly demonstrated the cross-reactivity of these pre-existed WT-NIEAs to a series of SARS-CoV-2 variants, helping to evaluate the risk of enhanced infection of emerging variants in future.

We found that mice deficient in platelets’ 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) demonstrate exacerbated inflammation and worse outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. One mediator derived from platelet 12-LOX activity, 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), was found to negatively correlate with disease severity. Taken together our data unravel a possible role of platelets and possibly 12-HETrE, which is documented as promoting anti-inflammatory effects, in dampening the inflammatory burden of infected mice and pinpoints potential new therapeutic strategies (12-LOX inhibitors or 12-HETrE receptor agonists) to better combat severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="Background Since the emergence of COVID-19 at the end of 2019, the disease has led to widespread acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), who are at increased risk due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy. This study aims to explore the differences in immune responses between kidney transplant recipients and non-kidney transplant recipients in COVID-19-induced ARDS to identify potential therapeutic targets for improving outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 108,320 cells derived from peripheral blood samples to construct a global single-cell map of COVID-19 induced ARDS in kidney transplant recipients(ARDSKT), COVID-19 induced ARDS in non transplant recipients(ARDSNKT), and healthy controls. Subsequently, using cellular clustering analysis, we obtained single-cell maps of different cell types. We employed enrichment analysis to determine the pathways involved in different subpopulations and focused on the role of key immune cells such as monocytes, megakaryocytes, B cells, and CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Significant immune differences were observed between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT. In ARDSKT, the S100A9+ MK subpopulation, which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, was elevated, promoting inflammation. In contrast, the S100A12+ monocyte subpopulation that activates the chemokine signaling pathway was more abundant in ARDSNKT, reflecting a stronger inflammatory response, while its abundance was reduced in ARDSKT due to immunosuppression. The CXCR4+ B subpopulation, crucial for adaptive immunity, was significantly reduced in ARDSKT. Additionally, the XAF1+ Teff subpopulation, associated with apoptosis, was more abundant in ARDSKT, potentially impairing immune recovery. This study highlights the immune differences between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT, revealing the impact of immunosuppression on immune dysregulation. These findings suggest that targeting specific immune pathways can improve therapeutic strategies for ARDSKT.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID‐19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS‐CoV‐2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID‐19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high‐throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID‐19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID‐19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation.

        <tr id="Vesiculovirus carajas (CARV) is a pathogen with neuroinvasive potential, yet its impact on neuroinflammation and sickness behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the neuropathological and immunological responses to CARV encephalitis in adult BALB/c mice. Mice were intranasally inoculated with either infected or uninfected brain homogenates, and clinical, histopathological, and cytokine profiles were analyzed. CARV antigens were primarily detected in necrotic neurons, with prominent microglial activation near the ventricles and blood vessels. By day 10 post-infection, infected mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of MCP-1, IFN-γ, IL-12 p70, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in the brain, indicating a strong inflammatory response. These findings highlight the inflammatory modulation associated with CARV infection and suggest a hematogenous route of neuroinvasion, distinguishing CARV from other vesiculovirus species. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of CARV encephalitis and its potential impact on neuroimmune dynamics.">

        <tr id="The health burden of ocular toxoplasmosis is substantial, and there is an unmet need for safe and curative anti-microbial drugs. One major barrier to research on new therapeutics is the lack of in vitro human-based models beyond two-dimensional cultured cells and tissue explants. We aimed to address this research gap by establishing a human retinal organoid model of ocular toxoplasmosis. Retinal organoids, generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells and grown to two stages of organization, were incubated with a suspension of live or heat-killed GT-1 strain T. gondii tachyzoites, or medium without tachyzoites. Both developing (1 month post-isolation) and matured (6 months post-isolation) organoids were susceptible to infection. Spread of live parasites from the margin to the entire organoid over 1 week was indicated by immunolabelling for T. gondii surface antigen 1. This progression was accompanied by changes in the levels of selected tachyzoite transcripts—SAG1, GRA6, and ROP16—and human cytokine transcripts—CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, and IL6—in infected versus control conditions. Our human retinal organoid model of ocular toxoplasmosis offers the opportunity for many future lines of study, including tachyzoite interactions with retinal cell populations and leukocyte subsets, parasite stage progression, and disease processes of different T. gondii strains, as well as drug testing.">

        <tr id="Microglia and astrocytes are the primary glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and their function is shaped by multiple factors. Regulation of CNS glia by the microbiota have been reported, although the role of specific bacteria has not been identified. We colonized germ-free mice with the type strain Akkermansia muciniphila (AmT) and a novel A. muciniphila strain BWH-H3 (Am-H3) isolated from a subject with multiple sclerosis and compared to mice colonized with Bacteroides cellulosilyticus strain BWH-E5 (Bc) isolated from a healthy control subject. We then investigated the effect of these bacteria on microglia and astrocyte gene expression by RNA sequencing. We found altered gene expression profiles in brain microglia, with Akkermansia downregulating genes related to antigen presentation and cell migration. Furthermore, we observed strain specific effects, with Akkermansia H3 upregulating histone and protein binding associated genes and downregulating channel and ion transport genes. Astrocyte pathways that were altered by Akkermansia H3 mono-colonization included upregulation of proliferation pathways and downregulation in cytoskeletal associated genes. Furthermore, animals colonized with type strain Akkermansia and strain H3 had effects on the immune system including elevated splenic γδ-T cells and increased IFNγ production in CD4 + T cells. We also measured intestinal short chain fatty acids and found that both A. muciniphila strains produced proprionate while B. cellulosilyticus produced acetate, proprionate, and isovalerate. Taken together, our study shows that specific members of the intestinal microbiota influence both microglial and astroyctes which may be mediated by changes in short chain fatty acids and peripheral immune signaling.

        <tr id="The understanding of how the host immune response differs in T-cell phenotype and memory formation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) remains limited. LTRs who recovered from COVID-19 infection without prior vaccination represent a unique population for studying immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Six LTRs with positive neutralizing antibodies (nAb+) and six LTRs with negative nAb (nAb-) were included at 6 months following COVID-19 infection. It was found that nAb+ LTRs had higher anti-RBD IgG titers and greater neutralizing percent inhibition compared to nAb- LTRs. Fifteen T-cell subsets were identified in COVID-19 convalescent LTRs, and it was shown that only terminal effector CD8+ - 3 decreased in the nAb+ group, while elevated IL-10 expression levels were found in the nAb- group. After stimulation with the SARS-CoV-2 XBB spike peptide pool in vitro, it was observed that the nAb+ group exhibited an increase in effector memory CD4+ cells with lower PD-1 expression, a reduction in effector memory CD4+ - 2 cells, and terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells, while the nAb- group showed high expression of CTLA-4 and IL-10 in terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells. Four SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell subsets were identified, with high expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ in terminal effector CD8+ - 1 and terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in both groups. Perforin was mainly detected in terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in nAb+ LTRs. In addition to these proportional differences, stem cell memory CD4+ cells with higher IL-17A expression and stem cell memory CD8+ cells with higher CTLA-4 expression were also found in nAb- LTRs. These findings suggest that LTRs who developed nAb+ following SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit stronger T-cell responses, with more robust immune activation and memory recall, compared to nAb- LTRs. This study underscores the importance of understanding T-cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 recovery for guiding vaccination strategies and managing immunity in LTRs.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes pulmonary edema, which disrupts the lung alveoli–capillary barrier and leads to pulmonary cell apoptosis, the main cause of death. However, the molecular mechanism behind SARS-CoV-2’s apoptotic activity remains unknown. Here, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a mediates the pulmonary pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is demonstrated by the fact that it causes lung tissue damage. The in vitro results showed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a triggers cell death via the disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis, which is modulated through the regulation of Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive Potassium Channel (MitoKATP). The addition of exogenous Potassium (K+) in the form of potassium chloride (KCl) attenuated mitochondrial apoptosis along with the inflammatory interferon response (IFN-β) triggered by SARS-ORF-3a. The addition of exogenous K+ strongly suggests that dysregulation of K+ ion channel function is the central mechanism underlying the mitochondrial dysfunction and stress response induced by SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a. Our results designate that targeting the potassium channel or its interactions with ORF-3a may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate the damaging effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Molecular changes underlying the persistent health effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. To discern the gene regulatory landscape in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients, we performed enzymatic DNA methylome and single-cell RNA sequencing in nasal cells of COVID-19 patients (n = 19, scRNA-seq n = 14) and controls (n = 14, scRNA-seq n = 10). In addition, we resampled a subset of these patients for transcriptome analyses at 3 (n = 7) and 12 months (n = 5) post infection and followed the expression of differentially regulated genes over time. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed 3112 differentially methylated regions between COVID-19 patients and controls. Hypomethylated regions affected immune regulatory genes, while hypermethylated regions were associated with genes governing ciliary function. These genes were not only downregulated in the acute phase of the disease but sustained repressed up to 12 months post infection in ciliated cells. Validation in an independent cohort collected 6 months post infection (n  = 15) indicated symptom-dependent transcriptional repression of ciliary genes. We therefore propose that hypermethylation observed in the acute phase may exert a long-term effect on gene expression, possibly contributing to post-acute COVID-19 sequelae.">

        <tr id="Background COVID-19 appears to have a progression of three stages. The latter stage is characterized by a high level of cytokine release, which in turn triggers an uncontrolled reaction known as cytokine storm where mast cells are involved. The presence of anti-IgE antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in this phase has been previously reported, suggesting an association with the severity of the disease. Our study aims to assess the prognostic significance of IgE antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 across a spectrum of clinical presentations, including individual with mild symptoms, hospitalized patients, and those who presented a critical progression. Methods The study included 64 patients distributed into the following groups: 22 critically ill hospitalized individuals (Critical); 21 non-critical hospitalized patients (Severe); 21 mild symptomatic non-hospitalized cases (Mild); and 22 healthy blood donors with samples collected in October 2019. Anti-IgE antibodies against Spike (S) protein were detected using a homemade ELISA, where the plate was sensitized with the RBD of recombinant S protein. Results Among 64 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 28.1% tested positive for IgE isotype antibodies against S protein RBD, whose prevalence was similar across severity groups: Mild 23.8%, Severe 28.6%, and Critical 31.8% (p = 0.842). Patients with IgE response exhibited higher levels of LDH compared to non-IgE responders, with a 40% increase (p = 0.037), and a non-significantly higher tendency in other inflammatory markers. Conclusion In SARS-CoV-2 infection, roughly a fourth of patients presented an IgE isotype response, regardless of disease severity, which is associated with higher levels of LDH.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Complement hyperactivation and thrombotic microangiopathy are closely associated with severe COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction is a key mechanism underlying thrombotic microangiopathy. To address the relationship between endothelial injury, complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy of severe COVID-19, we wonder whether, and if so, what and how SARS-CoV-2 factors make endothelial cells (ECs) sensitive to complement-mediated cytotoxicity. We revealed that multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins enhanced complement-mediated cytotoxicity to ECs by inhibiting membrane complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) and enhancing the deposition of complement-recognizing component FCN1. By screening with CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA libraries, we identified that ADAMTS9, SYAP1, and HIGD1A as intrinsic regulators of CD59 on ECs, which were inhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 M, NSP16, and ORF9b proteins. IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and IFN-α upregulated CD55 and CD59, while IFN-γ antagonized the inhibition of CD59 by the three SARS-CoV-2 proteins. So, the deficiency of IFN-γ weakened the protection of ECs by CRPs against complement-mediated injury which may be enhanced during infection. Our findings illustrated the regulation of protection against complement-mediated attack on self-cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune responses, providing insights into endothelial injury, thrombotic microangiopathy, and potential targets for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a leading cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide, and the only zoonotic hepatitis virus. HEV genotype 3 (HEV3) is associated with a range of clinical presentations including chronic infection in immunocompromised individuals in developed nations as well as sporadic cases of autochthonous HEV3 in Europe. Current in vitro models support low levels of HEV infection, hampering our understanding of viral pathogenesis and development of therapeutics. We developed modified culture methods for two widely used hepatoma cell lines, PLC-PRF-5 and Huh-7.5, and evaluated HEV infection. Simple epithelial-like polarity and differentiation formed in PLC-PRF-5 cells, evidenced by localisation of tight junction proteins occludin and zona-occludin 1 to intercellular junctions, and increased albumin production. Complex hepatocyte-like polarity was observed in Huh-7.5 cells, with tight junction proteins localised to shared internal bile canaliculi-like structures and retention of the fluorescent molecule, 5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein diacetate. Cells were infected with genotype 3 HEV, and enhanced infection and replication of HEV was observed using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescent labelling of HEV ORF2 and dsRNA. We describe robust, accessible models for HEV infection in vitro. These models will allow studies to further our understanding of this emerging zoonotic pathogen and develop therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly enhanced our understanding of CD8+ T cell immunity and their role in natural infection and vaccine-induced protection. Rapid and early SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses have been associated with efficient viral clearance and mild disease. Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses can compensate for waning, morbidity-related, and iatrogenic reduction of humoral immunity. After infection or vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells are formed, which mount an efficient recall response in the event of breakthrough infection and help to protect from severe disease. Due to their breadth and ability to target mainly highly conserved epitopes, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are also able to cross-recognize epitopes of viral variants, thus maintaining immunity even after the emergence of viral evolution. In some cases, however, CD8+ T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. In particular, delayed and uncontrolled, e.g., nonspecific and hyperactivated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses have been linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes. In this minireview, we summarize the tremendous knowledge about CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination that has been gained over the past 5 years, while also highlighting the critical knowledge gaps that remain.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity provides the critical first line of defense against infection and sterile triggers. Cell death is a key component of the innate immune response to clear pathogens, but excessive or aberrant cell death can induce inflammation, cytokine storm, and pathology, making it a central molecular mechanism in inflammatory diseases. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one such inflammatory disease, but the specific innate immune mechanisms driving pathology in this context remain unclear. Here, by leveraging RNAseq and tissue expression in clinical samples, we identified increased expression of the innate immune sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) in patients with ALD. We discovered that ZBP1 expression correlated with ALD progression in patients, and that ethanol induced ZBP1-dependent lytic cell death, PANoptosis, in immune (macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells) and non-immune cells (hepatocytes). Mechanistically, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF9 and IRF1 upregulated ZBP1 expression, allowing ZBP1 to sense Z-NAs through its Zα2 domain and drive PANoptosis signaling, cell membrane rupture through NINJ1, and DAMP release. Furthermore, the expressions of ZBP1 and NINJ1 were upregulated in both liver and serum samples from patients with ALD. In mouse models of chronic and acute ALD, ZBP1-deficient mice were significantly protected from disease pathology and liver damage. Overall, our findings establish the critical role of the ZBP1-NINJ1 axis regulated by IRFs in driving inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in liver cells, suggesting that targeting these molecules will have therapeutic potential in ALD and other inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections remain a significant public health burden globally with infected individuals at high risk for cognitive decline and memory loss even on combination antiretroviral therapy. Almost half of HIV infected individuals smoke, which drives poorer health outcomes including a higher dementia rate. Microglia are the brain’s immune cells that serve as a persistent HIV reservoir contributing to neuroinflammatory signaling. We examined interactions between the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 and nicotine within human microglia cells (HMC3) that endogenously express chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) shows that gp120 alters mitochondria proteins within HMC3 cells. In the presence of nicotine, gp120 increased the expression of mitochondrial prohibitin 2 (PHB2), cytochrome c (cyt c), and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) but decreased fission 1 (FIS1) levels. An analysis of mito-YFP expression confirms that interaction between nicotine and gp120 increases the size and branching of mitochondrial networks. Interaction between nicotine and gp120 is also surprisingly found to promote the release of amyloid precursor protein (APP) peptides from microglia. This was accompanied by visualization of amyloid containing vesicles that colocalized with the autophagy protein LC3B-II in the cell. Taken together, our findings show that interaction between nicotine and gp120 impact microglia in a manner that regulates mitochondrial proteins and network properties and impacts amyloid protein management and release within microglia. These mechanisms may contribute to understanding neuroinflammatory signaling in smokers with HIV.

        <tr id="Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) ligands effectively reduce immunopathological damage in viral pneumonia models. Specifically, S1P1 ligands inhibit cytokine storm and help preserve lung endothelial barrier integrity. We recently showed that the S1P receptor ligand ozanimod can be safely administered to hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibiting severe symptoms of viral pneumonia, with potential clinical benefits. Here, we extend on this study and investigate the impact of ozanimod on key features of the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. We quantified circulating cytokine levels, peripheral immune cell numbers, proportions and activation status; we also monitored the quality of the humoral response by assessing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) antibodies. Our findings reveal that patients receiving ozanimod during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significantly reduced numbers of circulating monocytes compared with those receiving standard care. Correspondingly, in the ozanimod-treated group, circulating levels of C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) were decreased. While treatment with ozanimod negatively impacted the humoral response to COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, it did not impair the development of a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in vaccinated patients. These findings suggest that ozanimod influences key immune mechanisms during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

The underlying mechanisms driving both acute and post-acute manifestations of COVID-19 are still poorly understood, warranting further investigation for new targets. The study represents the first attempt to explore the role of T-cadherin in COVID-19 pathogenesis as well as its implications in pulmonary fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. First, we revealed a significant decrease in T-cadherin expression in post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19 patients. This downregulated T-cadherin expression correlated with the elevated levels of VE-cadherin and reduced levels of β-catenin, suggesting a disruption in endothelial cell-cell contact integrity and function. Second, the reciprocal relation of T-cadherin and VE-cadherin expression was further confirmed using cultured human endothelial Ea.hy926 cells. T-cadherin overexpression caused a decrease in VE-cadherin mRNA expression in cultured endothelial cells providing additional evidence in favor of their interplay. Third, employing Cdh13 −/− mice, we unveiled the protective role of T-cadherin deficiency against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Fourth, we demonstrated the mice lacking T-cadherin to have downregulated reactive oxygen species production and Nox2 mRNA expression in an angiotensin II-mediated endothelial dysfunction model. Our findings provide rationale for further studies into T-cadherin-mediated mechanisms in these processes.">

Here, we present clinical, pathological, and virological analyses of three cases of prolonged COVID-19 among patients undergoing treatment for B-cell lymphoma. These patients had all been treated with anti-CD20 antibody and bendamustine. Despite various antiviral treatments, high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) levels persisted for >4 weeks, and two of them succumbed to COVID-19. The autopsy showed bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrosis. Overlapping cytomegalovirus, fungal and/or bacterial infections were also confirmed. Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed accumulation of mutations and changes in variant allele frequencies over time. NSP12 mutations V792I and M794I appeared independently in two cases as COVID-19 progressed. In vitro drug susceptibility analysis and an animal experiment using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that each mutation, V792 and M794I, was independently responsible for remdesivir resistance and attenuated pathogenicity. E340A, E340D, and F342INS mutations in the spike protein were found in one case, which may account for the sotrovimab resistance. Analysis of autopsy specimens indicated heterogeneous distribution of these mutations. In summary, we demonstrated temporal and spatial diversity in SARS-CoV-2 that evolved resistance to various antiviral agents in malignant lymphoma patients under immunodeficient conditions caused by certain types of immunochemotherapies. Strategies may be necessary to prevent the acquisition of drug resistance and improve outcomes, such as the selection of appropriate treatment strategies for lymphoma considering patients’ immune status and the institution of early intensive antiviral therapy.">

        <tr id="The nature of the effector and memory T cell response in the lungs following acute SARS-CoV-2 infections remains largely unknown. To define the pulmonary T-cell response to COVID-19, we compared effector and memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in mice. Both viruses elicited potent effector T cell responses in lungs, but memory T cells showed exaggerated contraction in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, unlike the T-bet/EOMES-driven effector transcription program in IAV lungs, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells embarked on a STAT-3-centric transcriptional program, a defining characteristic of a pro-fibro-inflammatory program: limited cytotoxicity, diminished expression of tissue-protective inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT), and augmented mucosal imprinting (CD103). Circulating CD45RO+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients expressed elevated levels of STAT-3 and low levels of TIGIT. IL-6 blockade experiments implicated IL-6 in STAT-3 induction and downregulation of PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific primary effector CD8 T cells. Memory CD8 T cells specific to a single epitope, induced by mucosal vaccination, differentiated into cytotoxic effectors and expressed high levels of CD103, effectively reducing viral burden in lungs following a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings have implications for developing targeted immunotherapies to mitigate immunopathology and promote protective T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background COVID‐19 exhibits a variety of symptoms and may lead to multi‐organ failure and death. This clinical complexity is exacerbated by significant immune dysregulation affecting nearly all cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. Granulocytes, including eosinophils, are affected by SARS‐CoV‐2. Objectives Eosinophil responses remain poorly understood despite early recognition of eosinopenia as a hallmark feature of COVID‐19 severity. Results The heterogeneous nature of eosinophil responses categorizes them as dual‐function cells with contradictory effects. Eosinophil activation can suppress virus‐induced inflammation by releasing type 2 cytokines like IL‐13 and granular proteins with antiviral action such as eosinophil‐derived neurotoxins and eosinophil cationic protein, and also by acting as antigen‐presenting cells. In contrast, eosinophil accumulation in the lungs can induce tissue damage triggered by cytokines or hormones like IFN‐γ and leptin. Additionally, they can affect adaptive immune functions by interacting with T cells through direct formation of membrane complexes or soluble mediator action. Individuals with allergic disorders who have elevated levels of eosinophils in tissues and blood, such as asthma, do not appear to be at an increased risk of developing severe COVID‐19 following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. However, the SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine appears to be associated with complications and eosinophilic infiltrate‐induced immunopathogenicity, which can be mitigated by corticosteroid, anti‐histamines and anti‐IL‐5 therapy and avoided by modifying adjuvants or excipients. Conclusion This review highlights the importance of eosinophils in COVID‐19 and contributes to a better understanding of their role during natural infection and vaccination.">

        <tr id="Abstract The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post‐stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p‐MCAO]) is utilized to profile single‐cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain‐resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post‐stroke disease‐related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease‐associated microglia, possibly arising from pre‐existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post‐stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lung diseases are widespread worldwide. Pulmonary immunity plays a vital role against lung pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the pathogenesis, including the development of local immune responses to infection, is fundamental for developing interventions to control the viral infection. Methods Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and euthanized 11–14 days later. Results Tertiary lymphoid tissue was found in all SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. The number (13.9 vs 1.5 iPLT number/ lung cm2), size (25992 vs 13946 µm2) and total area (0.46 vs 0.02 mm2 iPLT/ lung cm2) of the lymphoid tissue aggregations were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals than that of normal controls. This induced pulmonary lymphoid tissues comprised B cells, T cells, CD169 macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells with evidence of lymphocyte priming and differentiation. Discussion The results suggest local immunity plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study of pulmonary immunity could lead to new interventions to develop vaccine strategies and discover new immune-regulatory biomarkers in monitoring and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and other lung diseases.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged the current understanding of the complement cascade mechanisms of host immune responses during infection-induced nonresolvable lung disease. While the complement system is involved in opsonization and phagocytosis of the invading pathogens, uncontrolled complement activation also leads to aberrant autophagic response and tissue damage. Our recent study revealed unique pathologic and fibrotic signature genes associated with epithelial bronchiolization in the lung tissues of patients with nonresolvable COVID-19 (NR-COVID-19) requiring lung transplantation. However, there is a knowledge gap if complement components are modulated to contribute to tissue damage and the fibrotic phenotype during NR-COVID-19. We, therefore, aimed to study the role of the complement factors and their corresponding regulatory proteins in the pathogenesis of NR-COVID-19. We further examined the association of complement components with mediators of the host autophagic response. We observed significant upregulation of the expression of the classical pathway factor C1qrs and alternative complement factors C3 and C5a, as well as the anaphylatoxin receptor C5aR1, in NR-COVID-19 lung tissues. Of note, complement regulatory protein, decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) was significantly downregulated at both transcript and protein levels in the NR-COVID-19 lungs, indicating a dampened host protective response. Furthermore, we observed significantly decreased levels of the autophagy mediators PPARγ and LC3a/b, which was corroborated by decreased expression of factor P and the C3b receptor CR1, indicating impaired clearance of damaged cells that may contribute to the fibrotic phenotype in NR-COVID-19 patients. Thus, our study revealed previously unrecognized complement dysregulation associated with impaired cell death and clearance of damaged cells, which may promote NR-COVID-19 in patients, ultimately necessitating lung transplantation. The identified network of dysregulated complement cascade activity indicates the interplay of regulatory factors and the receptor-mediated modulation of host immune and autophagic responses as potential therapeutic targets for treating NR-COVID-19.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoinflammatory disease of unknown origin, involving characterized by immune cell infiltration into the target tissue, central nervous system (CNS), resulting in local and/or systemic inflammation. The symptoms vary from gait disturbance, visual impairment and learning and memory impairment and are being managed with corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive agents. However, several patients do not respond to these treatments, which can also elevate the risk of severe infections. Therefore, there remains an ongoing need to identify new therapeutic targets. MS exhibits distinctive pathology, clinical course, and treatment responses, suggesting the importance of targeting disease site-specific immune cells to mitigate immune system-induced inflammation, rather than employing broad immunosuppression. Chemokines and chemokine receptors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MS by recruiting immune cells to the CNS, leading to inflammation and demyelination. Therapies targeting chemokines have shown promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials, but more research is needed to fully understand their mechanisms and optimize their efficacy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential players in the immune response to infections, involved in shaping innate and adaptive immunity. However, a complete understanding of their specific roles in respiratory infections, including SARS‐CoV‐2, remains elusive. Methods To investigate the dynamics of monocytes and DCs in blood as well as the upper and lower airways, we sampled 147 patients with varying degree of COVID‐19 severity longitudinally during the spring of 2020. Results Using flow cytometry, proteomics and in vitro TLR stimulation, we found differences in the distribution and function of monocytes and DCs in patients compared with controls, and importantly, reduced levels of DCs in both blood and airways. In fact, lower frequencies of cDC2s (Lin− HLA‐DR+ CD1c+) early after symptom onset predicted subsequent severe disease, and depletion of DC subsets lasted longer in patients with more severe disease. In contrast, severe COVID‐19 was associated with increased frequencies of activated monocytes in the lower, but not the upper, airways. Proteomic analysis showed that monocyte and DC‐related cytokines in plasma and airways associated with disease severity. During convalescence, cell frequencies and responses to TLR ligands normalised in blood, except for persistently low plasmacytoid DCs. Conclusion Our study reveals a distinct pattern of recruitment of monocytes but not DCs to the airways during severe COVID‐19. Instead, decreased levels of DCs in both blood and airways were found, possibly contributing to more severe COVID‐19. The connection between low blood DCs early in disease course and more severe outcomes provides insight into COVID‐19 immunopathology, with possible therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with microcephaly in neonates and neurological disorders in adults. Chronic ZIKV infection has been identified in the testes, indicating that the virus can lead to prolonged illness, yet its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we found that ZIKV infection does not induce significant cell death in mouse macrophages despite the critical role that cell death plays in the antiviral immune response. Furthermore, we discovered that ZIKV infection impairs the activation of the NLPR3-dependent inflammasome and inhibits apoptosis. Consequently, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome and apoptosis in the context of ZIKV infection. Our results revealed significant reductions in the protein expression levels of NLRP3 and A20, attributable to post-transcriptional or translational effects during ZIKV infection. These findings suggest that ZIKV infection may disrupt cell death pathways, leading to its pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV), first isolated from a nonhuman primate in Africa in 1947, was relatively understudied until 2016. By then, ZIKV had already been reported in more than 20 countries and territories. The infection poses a significant risk, as it is associated with microcephaly in infants and neurological disorders in adults; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these severe outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that ZIKV infection significantly reduces the expression of NLRP3 and A20 proteins through post-transcriptional or translational processes, which leads to inhibited cell death. These findings are critical because cell death plays a vital role in the host's antiviral immune response. Our findings highlight how ZIKV infection compromises essential cell death pathways, raising serious concerns about its pathogenesis. A comprehensive understanding of this disruption is vital for developing targeted interventions to mitigate the virus' impact on public health.">

        <tr id="Background The intricacies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing acute lung injury (ALI) and modulating inflammatory factor dynamics in vivo remain poorly elucidated. The present study endeavors to explore the impact of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (S1SP) on ALI and inflammatory factor profiles in mice, aiming to uncover potential therapeutic targets and intervention strategies for the prevention and management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods To mimic COVID-19 infection, K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were intratracheally instilled with S1SP, while C57BL/6 mice were administered LPS to form a positive control group. This setup facilitated the examination of lung injury severity, inflammatory factor levels, and alterations in signaling pathways in mice mimicking COVID-19 infection. Histopathological assessment through HE staining, along with analysis of lung wet/dry ratio and ultrasound imaging, revealed severe lung injury. Results After molding, K18-hACE2 mice exhibited a pronounced reduction in body weight and showed more significant lung injury (P < 0.05). Notably, there was a significant elevation in vascular permeability, total protein, and total white blood cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (P < 0.05), indicative of tissue damage. Additionally, the tight junction of lung tissue was compromised (P < 0.05), accompanied by intense oxidative stress marked by decreased SOD activity and elevated MDA content (P < 0.05). Cytokine levels, including IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MIG, were significantly upregulated in both BALF and serum of S1SP + K18 mice (P < 0.05). Furthermore, S1SP prominently augmented the expression of p-p65/P65 and attenuated IκBα expression in the NF-κB signaling pathway of humanized mice (P < 0.05), corroborating a heightened inflammatory response at the tissue level (P < 0.05). Conclusion The administration of S1SP to K18-hACE2 mice resulted in severe lung injury, enhanced vascular permeability, and compromised epithelial barrier function in vivo. This was accompanied by disruption of lung tight junctions, the manifestation of severe oxidative stress and a cytokine storm, as well as the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, highlighting key pathological processes underlying COVID-19-induced lung injury.

        <tr id="Objectives/Goals: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to impact multiple organ systems, including the brain, and is associated with increased cognitive decline in vulnerable populations. The gut microbiome may play a significant role in modulating these effects, as shifts in microbiota composition have been linked to inflammation and systemic disease processes. Methods/Study Population: To explore these interactions, we conducted an acute COVID-19 study using 12-week-old C57 mice intranasally inoculated with 1x10^4 PFU of the Mouse Adapted 10 (MA-10) strain of SARS-CoV-2. On day 5 postinfection, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing on fecal samples, analyzed using QIIME2 and DeSeq2, to assess microbiome alterations and identify changes in metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory responses. Results/Anticipated Results: Analysis revealed notable shifts in the gut microbiome during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, with significant alterations in metabolic pathways related to inflammation and immune regulation. These changes suggest that early gut microbiome disruptions may contribute to the host response in acute COVID-19. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Our findings indicate that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to rapid alterations in the gut microbiome, which could underlie inflammatory and immune pathways impacting disease progression. These insights highlight the potential for microbiome-targeted therapies to mitigate acute COVID-19 morbidity and warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="Background: Abnormal activation of microglia occurs in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and leads to subsequent neuroinflammation and major AD pathologies. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as great potential therapeutic targets in AD. However, the extent of circRNAs entwined and the underlying mechanism in microglia-driven neuroinflammation in AD remain elusive. Methods: The circular RNA Dlg1 (circDlg1) was identified using circRNA microarray screening in magnetic-isolated microglia of APP/PS1 mice. CircDlg1 expression in microglia of APP/PS1 mice and AD patients was validated by FISH. Flow cytometry and immunostaining were conducted to explore the roles of circDlg1 in microglia. Adeno-associated virus 9 preparations for interfering with microglial circDlg1 were microinjected into mouse lateral ventricle to explore influences on microglial response, neuroinflammation and AD pathologies. Y-maze, novel object recognition and Morris water maze tasks were performed to assess cognitive performance. RNA pulldown assays, mass spectrometry analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to validate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of circDlg1. Results: A novel circular RNA circDlg1 was observed elevated using circRNA microarray screening in microglia isolated from APP/PS1 mice and validated increased in intracerebral microglia of AD patients. Microglia-specific knockdown of circDlg1 remarkably ameliorated microglial recruitment and envelopment of amyloid-β (Aβ), mitigated neuroinflammation, and prevented cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, circDlg1 interfered with the interaction between phosphodiesterase 4b (PDE4B) and Smurf2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase of PDE4B. The formed ternary complex protected PDE4B from ubiquitination-dependent degradation via unique N-terminal targeting domain, thus consequently decreasing cAMP levels. We further confirmed that microglial circDlg1 downregulation significantly activated PKA/CREB anti-inflammatory pathway by decreasing PDE4B protein levels in APP/PS1 mice. Conclusion: The novel microglia-upregulated circDlg1 tightly involves in neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice via determining the protein fate of PDE4B. Microglial loss of circDlg1 promotes microglial protective response to Aβ deposition and relieves neuroinflammation, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy that specifically targets the microglial response in AD.">

        <tr id="Pulmonary fibrosis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19. β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, has been shown to be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis). In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-hACE2 cell model to evaluate the efficacy of the A549-hACE2 monoclonal cell line against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The A549-hACE2 cells were then subjected to either knockdown or overexpression of the effector β-catenin, and the modified cells were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we employed transcriptomics and raw letter analysis approaches to investigate other potential effects of β-catenin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We successfully established a model of cellular fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung-derived cells. This model can be utilized to investigate the molecular biological mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways associated with virus-induced lung fibrosis. The results of our mechanistic studies indicate that β-catenin plays a significant role in lung fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the inhibition of β-catenin mitigated the accumulation of mesenchymal stroma in A549-hACE2 cells. Additionally, β-catenin knockdown was found to facilitate multi-pathway crosstalk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that β-catenin overexpression did not exacerbate cellular fibrosis may be attributed to the activation of PPP2R2B.">

        <tr id="Abstract Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-inducing diets recapitulate small cerebral vessel disease phenotypes in mice including cerebrovascular pathology/dysfunction, neuroinflammation, synaptic deficits, and cognitive decline. We recently showed that astrocyte signaling through calcineurin(CN)/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATs) plays a causative role in these phenotypes. Here, we assessed the impact of astrocytic signaling on microglia, which set inflammatory tone in brain. Seven-to-eight-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice received intrahippocampal injections of AAV2/5-Gfa2-EGFP (control) or adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the NFAT inhibitor VIVIT ( i.e. , AAV2/5-Gfa2-VIVIT-EGFP). Mice were then fed with control chow (CT) or B-vitamin-deficient chow for 12 weeks to induce HHcy. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the expression of the pan-microglial marker Iba1 and the homeostatic microglial marker P2ry12. Iba1 showed little sensitivity to diet, AAV treatment, or sex. Conversely, P2ry12 expression was reduced with HHcy diet in males, but not females. Treatment of males with AAV-Gfa2-VIVIT prevented the loss of P2ry12. We next conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to determine if microglial genes and/or microglial clustering patterns were sensitive to astrocyte signaling in a sex-dependent manner. In males, disease-associated microglial genes and subclusters were overrepresented in HHcy-treated mice, while VIVIT promoted the appearance of homeostatic microglial genes and clusters. In contrast, microglial genes in females were less sensitive to diet and AAV treatments, though disease-like patterns in gene expression were also observed in the HHcy condition. However, very few of the HHcy-sensitive microglial genes in females were affected by VIVIT. The results suggest a sexually dimorphic influence of astrocyte signaling on microglial phenotypes in the context of HHcy and small cerebral vessel disease.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection primarily affects the respiratory system but may induce hematological alterations such as anemia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Previous studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs); however, the subsequent effects on hematopoiesis and immune reconstitution have not yet been described. Here we evaluated the pathological effects of infection of umbilical-cord-blood-derived HSPCs with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant pseudovirus (PsV). Transcriptomic analysis of Omicron PsV-infected HSPCs revealed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation, aging and the NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting a potential trigger of inflammaging. Omicron PsV-infected HSPCs presented decreased numbers of multipotential progenitors (granulocyte‒erythrocyte‒macrophage‒megakaryocyte colony-forming units) ex vivo and repopulated primitive hematopoietic stem cells (Ki-67−hCD34+ cells) in an HSPC transplantation NOD-scid IL2rγnull mouse model (Omicron mouse). Furthermore, Omicron PsV infection induced myeloid-biased differentiation of HSPCs. Treatment with nanographene oxide, an antiviral agent, partially mitigated the myeloid bias and inflammaging phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insights into the abnormal hematopoietic and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight potential therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Since the initial identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections, numerous clinical challenges have arisen, revealing both acute and long-term effects associated with COVID-19. These effects impact various systems within the body, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Background/Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the immunological and inflammatory parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 and evaluate the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on these parameters. Methods: This study enrolled thirty patients from the Military Medical Institute—National Research Institute in Warsaw, who were hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were screened for eligibility based on pre-defined inclusion criteria. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) or a control group. Immune profiling was performed, measuring cytokine concentrations and leukocyte subpopulations in serum samples. Outcomes were assessed using Bayesian modeling. Results: Bayesian regression analysis confirmed previous findings, indicating that HBOT may reduce inflammatory cytokine levels while improving oxygen saturation (SpO2) in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. Moreover, the analysis suggested a higher probability of HBOT success in modulating the immune response and reducing inflammatory parameters, particularly in T lymphocyte subpopulations. Conclusions: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may serve as an effective adjunctive treatment for patients with COVID-19 by enhancing oxygen saturation and modulating the immune response. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of HBOT on inflammatory and immunological parameters in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The current lack of a straightforward and convenient modeling approach to simulate the onset of acute lung injury (ALI) has impeded fundamental research and hindered the screening of therapeutic drugs in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The co-cultured human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpics) and alveolar macrophages (AMs) were exposed to the complete medium, three concentrations of recombinant spike S1 protein (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/mL), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 μg/mL). The cells were harvested at 1, 2, and 3 days post-exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and IL-6, TNF-ɑ, and malondialdehyde (MDA) production were quantified and compared. Compared to those exposed to medium, co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs exposed to a concentration of S1 protein at 10 μg/mL demonstrated significantly increased levels of LDH release (22.9% vs. 9.1%, and 25.7%), IL-6 (129 vs. 74, and 110 pg/mg of protein), and TNF-ɑ (75 vs. 51, and 86 pg/mg of protein) production, and similar to those exposed to LPS. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in MDA production. Compared to those harvested at 1 or 2 days post-exposure, co-cultured cells harvested at 3 days post-exposure exhibited increased levels of LDH release (23.4% vs. 14.9%, or 16.7%), IL-6 (127 vs. 81, or 97 pg/mg of protein) and MDA (5.6 vs. 3.2, or 3.8 nmol/mg of protein) production, but exhibited lower TNF-ɑ (58 vs. 79 pg/mg of protein) production than those harvested at 2 days post-exposure. After 3 days of exposure, co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs showed significantly increased levels of LDH release (25.3% vs. 18.4%), and MDA production (5.5 vs. 4.3 nmol/mg of protein) compared to HPAEpics monocultures, and increased levels of LDH release (25.3% vs. 13.8%), IL-6 (139 vs. 98 pg/mg of protein) and MDA (5.5 vs. 4.7 nmol/mg of protein) production, and decreased TNF-ɑ (59 vs. 95 pg/mg of protein) production compared to AMs monocultures. Conclusions: The exposure to a concentration of S1 protein at 10 μg/mL in co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs induced significant injury and inflammation three days post-exposure. This methodology for establishing a COVID-19-associated ALI model may have promising potential applications and value.">

        <tr id="Interpreting viral mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 based on human body level is critical for developing more efficient interventions. Due to the limitation of data, limited models consider the viral dynamics of early phase of infection. The Human Challenge Study Killingley et al. (2022) enables us to garner data from the inoculation to the 14th day after the infection, which provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 within host infection dynamics. In the Human Challenge Study, each volunteer was inoculated with 10TCID50, approximately 55PFU, of a wild type of virus (Killingley et al. (2022)), and the data indicates that the viral load reduced below the detectable level within a day. The simplified within host models developed by Xu et al. (2023) explain the data from the Human Challenge Study (Killingley et al. (2022)). However, they do not explain the viral decay from Day 0 to Day 1. Hence, in this paper, we aim to develop a new viral mechanism to explain this phenomenon. Based on the simplified within host models developed by Xu et al. (2023), we consider that the virus will first go through an adjustment phase and then start to replicate. A new dose-response model is developed to evaluate the probability of infection by constructing a boundary problem. We will discuss this viral mechanism and fit the model to the data of the Human Challenge Study (Killingley et al. (2022)) by adopting AMC-SMC (approximate Bayesian computation-sequential Monte Carlo). Based on the results of parameter inference, we estimate that the adjusted viral load is around 1% of the inoculated viral load.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly evolved into a pandemic around the world. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the epidemiology and seasonality of other traditional respiratory viruses, e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, etc. These traditional respiratory viruses have transmission mode and clinical symptoms similar to SARS-CoV-2 but may differ in clinical outcomes and management. Co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses have been reported in the literature but have shown mixed evidence in clinical outcomes. With SARS-CoV-2 evolving into mild Omicron variants, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, which in turn affect the epidemiology and clinical course of respiratory viral infections. In response to these changes, multiplex molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses are attracting more attention in the field and have been developed into a variety of testing modalities. In this review, we describe the seasonality (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere), epidemiology, and clinical significance of traditional respiratory viruses and their co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the post-COVID era. Furthermore, we review commonly used multiplex molecular tests and their applications for the detection of respiratory viruses and their co-infections. Altogether, this review not only sheds light on the epidemiology and clinical significance of respiratory viral infections and co-infections in the post-COVID era, and but also provides insights into the laboratory-based diagnoses of respiratory viral infections using multiplex molecular testing.">

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has varied presentations from asymptomatic to death. Efforts to identify factors responsible for differential COVID-19 severity include but are not limited to genome wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptomic analysis. More recently, variability in host epigenomic profiles have garnered attention, providing links to disease severity. However, whole epigenome analysis of the respiratory tract, the target tissue of SARS-CoV-2, remains ill-defined. Results We interrogated the nasal methylome to identify pathophysiologic drivers in COVID-19 severity through whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of nasal samples from COVID-19 positive individuals with severe and mild presentation of disease. We noted differential DNA methylation in intergenic regions and low methylated regions (LMRs), demonstrating the importance of distal regulatory elements in gene regulation in COVID-19 illness. Additionally, we demonstrated differential methylation of pathways implicated in immune cell recruitment and function, and the inflammatory response. We found significant hypermethylation of the FUT4 promoter implicating impaired neutrophil adhesion in severe disease. We also identified hypermethylation of ELF5 binding sites suggesting downregulation of ELF5 targets in the nasal cavity as a factor in COVID-19 phenotypic variability. Conclusions This study demonstrated DNA methylation as a marker of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with enhancer-like elements playing significant roles. It is difficult to discern whether this differential methylation is a predisposing factor to severe COVID-19, or if methylation differences occur in response to disease severity. These differences in the nasal methylome may contribute to disease severity, or conversely, the nasal immune system may respond to severe infection through differential immune cell recruitment and immune function, and through differential regulation of the inflammatory response.

        <tr id="The immune system’s response to an invading pathogen is the critical determinant in recovery from illness. Here, we hypothesize that the immune response will swiftly follow classical activation and a resolution trajectory in patients with the rapid evolution of symptoms if challenged by a viral pathogen for the first time. Alternatively, a dysregulated response will be signified by a protracted clinical trajectory. Consequently, we enrolled 106 patients during the first wave of COVID-19 and collected their blood within 24 h, 48 h, 7 days, and over 28 days from symptoms onset. The pathogenic burden was measured via serum levels of the S-spike protein and specific immunoglobulin titers against the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The nonspecific immunological response was gauged using interleukin 6, leukocytosis, and C-reactive protein. Coagulation status was assessed. Several serum biomarkers were used as surrogates of clinical outcomes. We identified four clusters depending on the onset of symptoms (immediate [A], 6 days [B], 12 days [C], and over 21 days [D]). High variability in the S-spike protein in cluster A was present. The corresponding immunoglobulin titer was random. Only procalcitonin differentiated clusters in terms of markers of nonspecific inflammation. Coagulation markers were not significantly different between clusters. Serum surrogates on cardiomyopathy and neuronal pathology exhibited significant variability. Implementation of ECMO or noninvasive ventilation was more prominent in cluster C and D. Interestingly, SOFA or APACHE II scores were not different between nominal (A and B) versus dysregulated clusters (C and D).">

        <tr id="CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. While most infected people experienced mild illness, others progressed to severe disease, characterized by hyperinflammation and respiratory distress. There is still much to learn about the innate immune response to this virus. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor that is activated when pattern recognition receptors detect viruses. Upon activation, IRF3 induces the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) and interferon-stimulated genes, which protect the host from viral infection. However, coronaviruses antagonize this pathway, delaying type 1 IFN production. It is, therefore, unclear how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. Our prior reports showed that IRF3 promotes harmful inflammation during bacterial sepsis in mice. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that IRF3 cannot effectively control the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and instead promotes harmful inflammation during severe COVID-19. METHODS AND MODELS: We used mice transgenic for the human angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 transgene, driven by the keratin 18 promoter (K18-ACE2 mice) that were IRF3 deficient or IRF3 sufficient to test how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, K18-ACE2 mice showed a dose-dependent disease, characterized by mortality, lethargy, weight loss, and lung pathology, reminiscent of clinical COVID-19. However, K18-ACE2 mice lacking IRF3 were protected from severe disease with reduced mortality (84.6% vs. 100%) and disease score. We found that IRF3 promoted IFN-β production in the lungs and reprogrammed the cytokine profile, while viral load in the lungs was similar in the presence or absence of IRF3. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that IRF3 played a detrimental role in murine COVID-19 associated with changes in IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines.">

However, they showed favorable clinical outcomes after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or molnupiravir, despite the antiviral therapies being initiated later in the clinical course.

        <tr id="Excessive inflammation and cytokine release are hallmarks of severe COVID-19. Certain programmed cell death processes can drive inflammation, however, their role in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is unclear. Pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of regulated cell death initiated by inflammasomes and executed by the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). Using an established mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus and a panel of gene-targeted mice we found that deletion of the inflammasome (NLRP1/3 and the adaptor ASC) and pore forming proteins involved in pyroptosis (GSDMA/C/D/E) only marginally reduced IL-1β levels and did not impact disease outcome or viral loads. Furthermore, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not trigger GSDMD activation in mouse lungs. Finally, we did not observe any difference between WT animals and mice with compound deficiencies in the pro-inflammatory initiator caspases (C1/11/12-/-). This indicates that the classical canonical and non-canonical pro-inflammatory caspases known to process and activate pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and GSDMD do not substantially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. However, the loss of IL-1β, but not the absence of IL-18, ameliorated disease and enhanced survival in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals compared to wildtype mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that IL-1β is an important factor contributing to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, but its release was largely independent of inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways.">

        <tr id="The progression of COVID-19 involves a sophisticated and intricate interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host’s immune response. The immune system employs both innate and adaptive mechanisms to combat infection. Innate immunity initiates the release of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the adaptive immune response involves CD4+ Th lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and CD8+ Tc cells. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), activating the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling pathway, a crucial component of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This pathway fulfills a dual function during infection. In the early phase of infection, the virus can suppress cGAS-STING signaling to avoid immune detection. However, in the late stages, the activation of this pathway may trigger excessive inflammation and tissue damage, exacerbating disease severity. Modulating the cGAS-STING pathway, whether through agonists like dimeric amidobenzimidazole (diABZI) or inhibitors targeting viral proteins, such as 3CLpro, for example, offers a promising approach for personalized therapy to control the immune response and mitigate severe inflammation, ultimately improving clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus pyogenes, or Group A Streptococus (GAS), a significant human pathogen, employs quorum sensing (QS) systems to coordinate its behavior and genetic regulation in order to enhance survival. Our previous research established that one such QS system, the Rgg2/3 system, can suppress macrophage NFκB activity and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Yet, the scope of suppression and the mechanism by which it occurs remains unknown. In this study, we used transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic approaches to address these unanswered questions. We found QS-ON GAS broadly suppressed most inflammatory transcriptional pathways including those of NFκB, type I and type II interferon responses, and intracellular stress responses. Yet, we found no alternative transcriptional programs were activated after QS-ON GAS infection. Additionally, phosphoproteomics showed no disruption in typical inflammatory pathways such as those related to NFκB and MAPK activation, which was confirmed by western blotting and translocation assays. Instead, the proteomic data highlighted a potential role for epigenetic mechanisms of inflammatory regulation. To determine if epigenetic regulation was involved in QS-mediated immunomodulation, DNA methylation was measured and studies were performed inhibiting various histone and chromatin modifiers. These studies also showed no dijerence between QS-ON compared with QS-OFF infected macrophages. These findings expand our understanding of QS-mediated suppression and of GAS virulence strategies that appear to employ unusual methods of restricting inflammation. Uncovering this mechanism will ojer invaluable insight into GAS, itself, as well as understudied immunological pathways. Importance Streptococcus pyogenes is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes over 600 million infections every year and 500 thousand to 1 million fatalities. While in developed countries it is generally known to cause mild conditions such as pharyngitis, it can also manifest as severe infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, septic arthritis, and lead to post-infectious sequelae including rheumatic heart disease and glomerulonephritis. Elucidating new mechanisms of virulence in this organism, including how it evades and suppresses immune responses can be critical in understanding its pathogenicity, epidemiology, and identification of novel treatment avenues in this era of multi-drug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we characterize the broad spectrum by which GAS modulates the host innate immune response and begin to uncover host pathways that bacteria can use or inhibit for its survival.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Co‐infection with HIV and SARS‐CoV‐2 presents a complex clinical picture. Deciphering the immune response in this population, particularly the role of cytokines underlying immunopathogenesis could elucidates the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Methods This prospective, two‐stage study enrolled 75 individuals with HIV diagnosed with COVID‐19 (case group) and 25 individuals from the general population infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 only (control group). COVID‐19 diagnosis followed World Health Organization guidelines. Plasma cytokine levels were measured using a cytokine bead array. Results The case group skewed slightly females (61.2% vs. 42.9% female in the control group) an average age of 3 years older (44.13 years vs. 40.86 years). Importantly, all the case group participants had mild complications, while a significant majority (88.1%) in the control group experienced severe complications. The control group displayed a substantially higher IgM titer 963 IU/mL compared to only 39.3 IU/mL in the case group. The control group had significantly higher levels of IL‐6, IL‐10, IFN‐γ, TNF‐α compared to the case group. Conclusion This study suggests a potentially distinct immune response in HIV‐positive patients when infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Elucidating these differences could lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.">

        <tr id="Animal models are indispensable for unraveling the mechanisms underlying post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). This review evaluates recent research on PASC-related perturbations in animal models, drawing comparisons with clinical findings. Despite the limited number of studies on post-COVID conditions, particularly those extending beyond three months, these studies provide valuable insights. Three hallmark features of PASC—lung fibrosis, hyperglycemia, and neurological sequelae—have been successfully replicated in animal models, paving the way for mechanistic discoveries and future medical interventions. Although most studies have reported post-COVID conditions within 14–60 days post-infection, they still offer critical reference for future long-term research. This review also explores potential mechanisms of persisting immune misfiring, a key factor in the chronicity of PASC symptoms. Moreover, challenges in modeling PASC are also discussed, including the limited genetic diversity in inbred animal strains and difficulties in accurately identifying PASC-affected individuals. To address these issues, we propose methodological improvements, such as comparing individual animal parameters with control averages and incorporating genetically diverse populations like collaborative cross models. These strategies will enhance the identification and characterization of PASC endotypes in animal studies. By integrating findings from animal models with clinical manifestations of PASC, future research can provide more valuable insights into its mechanisms and support the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need for longitudinal studies in animal models to fully uncover the mechanisms driving PASC and guide interventions to mitigate its public health impact.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 is characterized by the persistence of symptoms and immune alterations beyond the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the demographic, clinical, and immunological differences between individuals with and without long COVID-19 is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This observational study included 206 participants, comprising 90 patients with long COVID-19 and 116 without. Data on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were collected, alongside immune cell profiles and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Statistical analyses compared these parameters between the two groups. Long COVID-19 patients were predominantly female (77.8%), older (47.78% aged 41–60, 20% >60 years), and had higher BMI, hypertension (31.1%), and autoimmune diseases (11.1%) compared to nonlong COVID-19 individuals (P < 0.001). Clinical symptoms unique to long COVID-19 included memory loss (40.0%), hair loss (37.8%), fatigue (35.6%), and myalgia/arthralgia (28.9%), all absent in the control group (P < 0.001). Immunologically, patients with long COVID-19 exhibited distinct immune profiles, including elevated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+), reduced B cells, and higher CD4/CD8 ratios. Moreover, long COVID-19 patients had higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, with 15.5% showing levels between 1000–2500 BAU/ml, compared to 6.9% in controls. These immunological biomarkers, including altered T cell subsets and antibody levels, highlight the complex immune dysregulation associated with long COVID-19. These findings could inform future clinical management and therapeutic strategies targeting immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bats are reservoirs for multiple viruses, some of which are known to cause global disease outbreaks. Virus spillovers from bats have been implicated in zoonotic transmission. Some bat species can tolerate viral infections, such as infections with coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses, better than humans and with less clinical consequences. Bat species are speculated to have evolved alongside these viral pathogens, and adaptations within the bat immune system are considered to be associated with viral tolerance. Inflammation and cell death in response to zoonotic virus infections prime human immunopathology. Unlike humans, bats have evolved adaptations to mitigate virus infection-induced inflammation. Inflammatory cell death pathways such as necroptosis and pyroptosis are associated with immunopathology during virus infections, but their regulation in bats remains understudied. This review focuses on the regulation of inflammation and cell death pathways in bats. We also provide a perspective on the possible contribution of cell death-regulating proteins, such as caspases and gasdermins, in modulating tissue damage and inflammation in bats. Understanding the role of these adaptations in bat immune responses can provide valuable insights for managing future disease outbreaks, addressing human disease severity, and improving pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="Cognitive impairment is one of the many symptoms reported by individuals suffering from long-COVID and other post-viral infection disorders such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A common factor among these conditions is a sustained immune response and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are two such cytokines that are elevated in patients diagnosed with long-COVID and ME/CFS. In this study, we characterized the changes in neural functionality, secreted cytokine profiles, and gene expression in co-cultures of human iPSC-derived neurons and primary astrocytes in response to prolonged exposure to TNF-α and IL-6. We found that exposure to TNF-α produced both a concentration-independent and concentration-dependent response in neural activity. Burst duration was significantly reduced within a few days of exposure regardless of concentration (1 pg/mL – 100 ng/mL) but returned to baseline after 7 days. Treatment with low concentrations of TNF-α (e.g., 1 and 25 pg/mL) did not lead to changes in the secreted cytokine profile or gene expression but still resulted in significant changes to electrophysiological features such as interspike interval and burst duration. Conversely, treatment with high concentrations of TNF-α (e.g., 10 and 100 ng/mL) led to reduced spiking activity, which may be correlated to changes in neural health, gene expression, and increases in inflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g., IL-1β, IL-4, and CXCL-10) that were observed at higher TNF-α concentrations. Prolonged exposure to IL-6 led to changes in bursting features, with significant reduction in the number of spikes in bursts across a wide range of treatment concentrations (i.e., 1 pg/mL–10 ng/mL). In combination, the addition of IL-6 appears to counteract the changes to neural function induced by low concentrations of TNF-α, while at high concentrations of TNF-α the addition of IL-6 had little to no effect. Conversely, the changes to electrophysiological features induced by IL-6 were lost when the cultures were co-stimulated with TNF-α regardless of the concentration, suggesting that TNF-α may play a more pronounced role in altering neural function. These results indicate that increased concentrations of key inflammatory cytokines associated with long-COVID can directly impact neural function and may be a component of the cognitive impairment associated with long-COVID and other post-viral infection disorders.">

        <tr id="Background Chronic inflammation and immune imbalance mediated by macrophages are considered pivotal in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The study aims to clarify the macrophage heterogeneity and phenotype dynamics, and pinpoint critical targets within efferocytosis in DKD. Methods Utilizing early human DKD sequencing data, we computed the potential communication between leukocytes and renal intrinsic cells. Subsequently, we scrutinized the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from CD45-enriched immune cells, concentrating on the macrophage subsets in DKD. Pseudotime trajectory analysis was conducted to explore cell development. Differential expression genes (DEGs) from macrophage subgroups and bulk RNA-sequencing were used to identify shared hub genes. The NephroseqV5 platform was employed to evaluate the clinical significance, and the expression of key molecules was validated in DKD tissues. Results Macrophage infiltration rose in DKD, causing inflammation through the release of chemokines. As time progressed, the number of resident macrophages substantially dropped, with diminishing M1-like and increasing M2-like phenotypes relative to early stages. Further analysis pointed to the most enrichment of macrophage function is the phagosome. We overlapped the DEGs with efferocytosis-related genes and identified key genes, including CD36, ITGAM, and CX3CR1, which exhibited significant correlations with macrophages and T cells. The Nephroseq database revealed that they are associated with proteinuria and renal function. Consistent with the validation set, in vivo experiments verified elevated expression levels of key molecules. Conclusions In essence, our research elucidated the dynamics in macrophage subtype transitions. It emphasized three pivotal genes as critical modulators of macrophage efferocytosis in DKD, indicating their potential as innovative biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Background In tuberculosis (TB) infection, monocytes play a crucial role in regulating the balance between immune tolerance and immune response through various mechanisms. A deeper understanding of the roles of monocyte subsets in TB immune responses may facilitate the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies and improve TB prevention and treatment. Methods We retrieved and processed raw single-cell RNA-seq data from SRP247583. Single-cell RNA-seq combined with bioinformatics analysis was employed to investigate the roles of monocytes in TB progression. Results Our findings revealed that classical monocytes expressing inflammatory mediators increased as the disease progressed, whereas non-classical monocytes expressing molecules associated with anti-pathogen infection were progressively depleted. Pseudotime analysis delineated the differentiation trajectory of monocytes from classical to intermediate to non-classical subsets. An abnormal differentiation trajectory to non-classical monocytes may represent a key mechanism underlying TB pathogenesis, with CEBPB and CORO1A identified as genes potentially related to TB development. Analysis of key transcription factors in non-classical monocytes indicated that IRF9 was the only downregulated transcription factor with high AUC activity in this subset. The expression of IRF9 exhibited a decreasing trend in both latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB groups. Furthermore, dysregulation of transcription factor regulatory networks appeared to impair ferroptosis, with ferroptosis-associated genes MEF2C, MICU1, and PRR5 identified as potential targets of IRF9. Through cell communication analysis, we found that interactions between non-classical monocytes and other subpopulations may mediate TB progression, with MIF and LGALS9 highlighted as potential signaling pathways. Conclusion This study employs bioinformatics analysis in conjunction with single-cell sequencing technology to uncover the crucial role of monocyte subsets in tuberculosis infection.

        <tr id="Purpose of review Nonhuman primate (NHP) models of HIV-1 infection provide complementary experimental pathways for assessing aspects of acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) that cannot be addressed in humans. This article reviews acute infection studies in SIV-infected or SHIV-infected macaque species over the previous 18 months. Recent findings Reviewed studies examined the dynamics of replication-competent viral reservoir establishment during early infection, reservoir maintenance throughout therapy, and factors influencing viral rebound after treatment cessation. Also discussed are acute infection events in the central nervous system and liver and potential links between these events and manifestations of comorbidities during chronic infection. Additional studies addressed how occurrences during acute infection impact the development of natural viral control or posttreatment control. Another report evaluated treatment during acute infection with broadly neutralizing antibodies with enhanced ability to engage innate immune cells, highlighting the ability of this early intervention to shape innate and adaptive antiviral responses. Summary NHP models of HIV-1 infection are a fundamental research tool for investigating AHI events. These models enable detailed pathogenesis characterization and the testing of hypothesis-driven strategies for altering disease courses through interventions during AHI, including targeting viral persistence and comorbidities that persist throughout chronic infection.">

        <tr id="Background Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of global mortality, with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) significantly increasing the disease’s morbidity and mortality. Among the pathogens implicated in AECOPD, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is increasingly recognized as a major co-infecting bacterium. Despite its clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets underlying AECOPD with P. aeruginosa infection remain inadequately understood. Methods We employed a multi-omics approach, integrating proteomic analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma with transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood. A discovery cohort of 40 AECOPD with P. aeruginosa infection patients and 20 healthy controls was analyzed, followed by validation in an independent cohort of 20 patients and 10 controls. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and genes (DEGs) were identified and subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and immune infiltration analysis. Molecular docking simulations were conducted to explore potential therapeutic agents. Results Our integrative analysis identified key biomarkers, which played critical roles in oxidative stress and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, both of which were pivotal in the pathogenesis of AECOPD with P. aeruginosa infection. The combined analysis of BALF, plasma, and peripheral blood underscored the interplay between local lung changes and systemic immune responses. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted significant pathways related to bacterial defense, inflammation, and immune activation. Validation in an independent cohort confirmed the diagnostic value of three key proteins (AZU1, MPO, and RETN), with high area under the curve (AUC) values in ROC analyses. Molecular docking indicated strong binding affinities of these proteins with Pioglitazone and Rosiglitazone, suggesting potential therapeutic utility. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AECOPD with P. aeruginosa infection, highlighting the pivotal roles of oxidative stress and NET formation in disease progression. The identified biomarkers offer promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Our findings pave the way for novel strategies to improve outcomes for AECOPD patients with P. aeruginosa infection. While the study design limits our ability to establish causality, these results provide important insights that warrant further investigation, particularly through longitudinal studies, to confirm the specific contributions of P. aeruginosa in exacerbations.

        <tr id="Introduction Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by irreversible airflow limitation and systemic immune impacts. COPD patients demonstrate an increased susceptibility to sepsis and septic shock, underscoring the importance of understanding its effects on splenic function. Methods A rat COPD model was established using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cigarette smoke exposure. Splenic function was assessed through carbon clearance assays, histological analysis, and high-throughput mRNA sequencing. In vitro assays were conducted to evaluate the role of secretoglobin family 1a member 1 (SCGB1A1) in macrophage activation and lymphocyte proliferation. Results Carbon clearance assays revealed a significant reduction in splenic phagocytic activity in the smoke-exposed group. Histological analysis showed lymphoid follicle atrophy and connective tissue hyperplasia. High-throughput mRNA sequencing identified 102 upregulated and 32 downregulated genes in the smoke-exposed group, with SCGB1A1 notably upregulated. In vitro assays confirmed that SCGB1A1 inhibits LPS-induced macrophage activation and Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Conclusion These findings suggest that SCGB1A1 contributes to splenic immune dysfunction in COPD. Targeted inhibition of SCGB1A1 expression in the spleen may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of sepsis in COPD patients.">

        <tr id="Since SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented changes in the epidemiology of other infectious diseases, investigations on coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and one of the famous vector-borne diseases, malaria, are crucial for disease control, especially in malaria-endemic areas. The clinical profiles, possible mechanisms for interactions, and representative control measures of COVID-19 and malaria coinfections have recently garnered public attention. The overlap in epidemiology, infection incubation, and clinical symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria coinfections has been thoroughly discussed to provide a detailed diagnostic procedure for coinfections, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions. Immunological and genetic evidence has shown that previous malaria exposure may protect the body from the poor prognosis of COVID-19. ACE2 downregulation and TLR-induced pathways play a role in this protective effect, as do CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell activation and coinhibitory receptor upregulation, which help maintain a balance of immune reactions. Finally, multiple control measures for coinfections were discussed, and malaria control efforts were enriched in the context of COVID-19. These efforts included (1) developing vaccinations; (2) evaluating the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment; (3) exploring recent advances in natural products that are potentially useful for coinfection treatment; (4) researching and implementing bioinsecticides for malaria control, such as gene-driven mosquitoes, fungi, and bacterial symbionts; and (5) improving national electronic disease surveillance platforms in malaria-endemic regions. At last, the above findings summarized valuable lessons about malaria and COVID-19 control and expedite further investigations on coinfections with complex clinical presentations.

        <tr id="Background Severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by an excessive presence of neutrophils. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), released by activated neutrophils due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, contribute to lung epithelial cell death and are key drivers in COVID-19-associated immunothrombosis. However, the mechanism underlying NET formation in COVID-19 remain unclear. Methods Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from the serum of COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers, while neutrophils were isolated from blood samples of healthy volunteers. Neutrophils were treated with EVs, and the formation of NETs was observed. To identify the components responsible for the COVID-19-EVs-induced NET formation, we analyzed the expression profiles of microRNA (miRNAs) in COVID-19-EVs. We identified eight highly expressed miRNAs in COVID-19-EVs and explored their potential roles in COVID-19-EVs-mediated NET formation. Additionally, we explored the role of miR-20b-5p in COVID-19-EVs-induced NET formation. Results In this study, we demonstrate that patients with COVID-19 have a higher concentration of serum EVs (COVID-19-EVs) than healthy controls (Normal-EVs). We also found that COVID-19-EVs are internalized by neutrophils to induced NET formation. Through comprehensive miRNA profiling of COVID-19-EVs versus Normal-EVs, we identified 78 differentially expressed miRNAs, with 27 of these being upregulated and 51 being downregulated. Subsequently, we discovered that COVID-19-EVs that were highly abundant with certain miRNAs promote NET formation. Specifically, miR-20b-5p was found to be the strongest inducer of NET formation of the identified miRNAs. Inhibition of miR-20b-5p resulted in a significant decrease in COVID-19-EVs-mediated induction of NET formation. Conclusion Herein, we reveal a previously unknown role of COVID-19-EVs in NET formation, which contributes to COVID-19 progression. This study suggests that miR-20b-5p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment.

        <tr id="Background and objectives Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) bring cancer patients tumor control and survival benefits, yet they also trigger immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), notably checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP), affecting about 5% of patients among whom 1–2% experiencing severe grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Current research points to potential links with T cell subset dysfunction and autoantibody increase, but the specific mechanisms underlying different grades of CIP are understudied. Methods Herein, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from CIP patients across varying severity levels, aiming to elucidate underlying immune environment and mechanisms of CIP progression at cellular and molecular levels. Findings Totally, 121,409 high qualified cells from BALF of 11 patients were annotated and categorized into five major cell types. Severe CIP (CIP-S) cases have a significant increase in the percentage of unreported epithelial cells in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with mild CIP (CIP-M) cases. These cells were defined as aberrant basaloid cells. They upregulated SOX9, increased the expression of CXCL3/5, recruited neutrophils, and activated the immune system. Additionally, macrophages in the CIP-S group had stronger antigen-presenting abilities and resulted in more CD8 + effective T cells infiltrated. Conclusions Utilizing single-cell sequencing of BALF, we discovered an enriched population of aberrant basaloid cells in CIP-S patients, which had not been previously reported. Aberrant basaloid cells may upregulate SOX9 via CXCL3/5-CXCR2 to recruit and activate neutrophils, and further activate the immune system, resulting in CIP-S. This finding could identify new targets for stratified treatment of CIP patients, holding promise of a novel approach for clinical guidance.

        <tr id="Asthma has long been associated with increased susceptibility to viral respiratory infections, leading to significant exacerbations and poorer clinical outcomes. Contrarily and interestingly, emerging data and research surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that patients with asthma infected with SARS-CoV-2 experienced decreased severity of disease, lower hospitalization rates, as well as decreased morbidity and mortality. Research has shown that eosinophils could enhance immune defense against viral infections, while inhaled corticosteroids can assist in controlling systematic inflammation. Moreover, reduced ACE-2 expression in individuals with asthma may restrict viral entry, and the Th2 immune response may offset the Th1 response typically observed in severe COVID-19 patients. These factors may help explain the favorable outcomes seen in asthmatic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review highlights potential protective mechanisms seen in asthmatic patients, including eosinophilia, the use of inhaled corticosteroids, reduced ACE-2 expression, and a dominate Th2 immune response. Such a study will be helpful to better manage patients with asthma who have contracted COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious and severe infectious disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). The disease significantly threatens the sustainable development of the global pig industry. Unfortunately, to date, no safe and efficacious vaccines are commercially available except in Vietnam. Antioxidative stress is a critical factor in antiviral strategies. In this study, we show that ASFV infection elevates the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppresses the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, overexpressing Nrf2 can significantly inhibit ASFV replication. Through high-throughput screening of natural small molecules against ASFV, we identify resveratrol (RES), an Nrf2 activator, as a compound capable of inducing the cellular antiviral responses and effectively inhibiting ASFV replication in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Notably, untargeted metabolomics profiling reveals that glutathione emerges as a primary differential metabolite related to the antiviral activities of RES against ASFV. Mechanistically, RES exerts its antiviral effects and attenuates the elevated level of ROS caused by ASFV infection by inducing the production of reduced glutathione (GSH) via the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, RES exhibits broad efficacy as a potentially effective compound for inhibiting ASFV infection and alleviating the oxidative stress induced by ASFV infection via the Nrf2 signaling pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The COVID‐19 pandemic has left an indelible mark on the world, with mounting evidence suggesting that it not only posed acute challenges to global healthcare systems but has also unveiled a complex array of long‐term consequences, particularly cognitive impairment (CI). As the persistence of post‐COVID‐19 neurological syndrome could evolve into the next public health crisis, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of the intricate pathophysiology of CI in COVID‐19 patients and viable treatment strategies. Methods This comprehensive review explores the pathophysiology and management of cognitive impairment across the phases of COVID‐19, from acute infection to Long‐COVID, by synthesizing findings from clinical, preclinical, and mechanistic studies to identify key contributors to CI, as well as current therapeutic approaches. Results Key mechanisms contributing to CI include persistent neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular complications, direct neuronal injury, activation of the kynurenine pathway, and psychological distress. Both pharmacological interventions, such as anti‐inflammatory therapies and agents targeting neuroinflammatory pathways, and non‐pharmacological strategies, including cognitive rehabilitation, show promise in addressing these challenges. Although much of the current evidence is derived from preclinical and animal studies, these findings provide foundational insights into potential treatment approaches. Conclusion By synthesizing current knowledge, this review highlights the importance of addressing COVID‐19‐related cognitive impairment and offers actionable insights for mitigation and recovery as the global community continues to grapple with the pandemic's long‐term impact.">

        <tr id="Hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the non-coding region of the gene C9orf72 is the most prevalent mutation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The C9orf72 HRE contributes to neuron degeneration in ALS/FTD through both cell- autonomous mechanisms and non-cell autonomous disease processes involving glial cells such as microglia. The molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution of C9orf72-HRE microglia to neuron death in ALS/FTD remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we generated microglia from human C9orf72-HRE and isogenic iPSCs using three different microglia derivation methods. RNA sequencing analysis reveals a cell-autonomous dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and genes involved in pathways underlying inflammasome activation in C9orf72-HRE microglia. In agreement with elevated expression of inflammasome components, conditioned media from C9orf72-HRE microglia enhance the death of C9orf72- HRE motor neurons implicating microglia-secreted molecules in non-cell autonomous mechanisms of C9orf72 HRE pathology. These findings suggest that aberrant activation of inflammasome-mediated mechanisms in C9orf72-HRE microglia results in a pro-inflammatory phenotype that contributes to non-cell autonomous mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in ALS/FTD. Summary This study describes phenotypic alterations in C9orf72-ALS/FTD microglia implicating extracellular matrix remodeling and inflammasome activation in microglia-mediated neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD.">

        <tr id="T-cell ageing may be a key factor in the disproportionate severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older populations. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients, treatment involving the use of monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 usually involves the administration of high doses but has not been very effective at preventing complications or fatality, highlighting the need for additional research into anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, particularly for older populations. In this study, it is discovered that older persons with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has weaker T-cell responses. Therefore the development and characterization of spike-targeting T-cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) full-length human immunoglobulin Gs with enhanced efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is described. Using S-targeting TDBs, polyclonal T cells are guided to target and destroy S-expressing cells, preventing the cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby eliminating the need for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Using animal models of COVID-19, it is shown that the selective activation of T cells improves the efficiency of treatment in preinfected mice by attenuating disease-induced weight loss and death. The significance of T-cell-based immunity during infection is highlighted by the findings. These results have implications for better clinical effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 and the development of T-cell-dependent medicines for the elderly population.">

An ominous turn in the pandemic is the evolving public health crisis emanating from persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated long-term impact. Long COVID or post–COVID syndrome describes protean symptoms that persist at least 3 months after the onset of acute illness and last for at least 2 months in individuals with a history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Long COVID has become a public health concern. Millions of infected individuals are now facing chronic multi-organ failures, including neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and kidney complications. In general, the cause of long COVID syndrome is unclear but factors such as prolonged activation of immune responses, and viral persistence triggering transcription dysregulation of genes associated with normal thrombotic disease may play a role in cardiovascular complications. Although inflammatory biomarkers are reported in other disorders, it remains unclear whether similar biomarkers are associated with cardiovascular manifestations following COVID. Medications such as sulodexide directed at glycocalyx and coagulation have demonstrated benefits for long COVID in smaller studies.

        <tr id="Cellular innate immune pathways are formidable barriers against viral invasion, creating an environment unfavorable for virus replication. Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in driving and regulating these cell-intrinsic innate antiviral mechanisms through the action of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The host IFN response obstructs viral replication at every stage, prompting viruses to evolve various strategies to counteract or evade this response. Understanding the interplay between viral proteins and cell-intrinsic IFN-mediated immune mechanisms is essential for developing antiviral and anti-inflammatory strategies. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses, encode a range of proteins that, through shared and distinct mechanisms, inhibit IFN-mediated innate immune responses. Compounding the issue, a dysregulated early IFN response can lead to a hyper-inflammatory immune reaction later in the infection, resulting in severe disease. This review provides a brief overview of HCoV replication and a detailed account of its interaction with host cellular innate immune pathways regulated by IFN.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Targeted therapies leveraging the innate immune system are emerging as promising cancer treatments. The mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) plays a crucial role in initiating innate immune responses, but its clinical use is limited by the risk of uncontrolled activation and systemic toxicity. To address this, we developed a novel therapeutic agent, the truncated interferon activation switch (TRIAS), combining MAVS truncates with a tumor antigen-targeting single-chain variable fragment (scFv). This design ensures antigen-dependent, controlled activation. Lentiviral delivery of TRIAS induced significant antitumor responses, including complete tumor regression in some cases. Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis further confirmed that tumor cells were the predominant population expressing the transgene. TRIAS-expressing tumor cells exhibited enhanced antitumor activity, likely due to increased cytokine release and upregulated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, enabling tumor cells to function as antigen-presenting cells. This activated other immune cells, driving adaptive immune responses. Additionally, TRIAS promoted a proinflammatory shift in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In conclusion, TRIAS was validated as an innovative immunotherapeutic agent with MAVS-like immune-activating properties and tightly controlled mechanisms, offering a safer and more effective approach for clinical cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The novel H10N3 avian influenza virus (AIV) has infected four individuals since 2021 and caused severe respiratory damage, posing a significant threat to public health. However, its pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our findings revealed that H10N3 infection induces severe lung damage and causes death in mice, even at low doses. The elevated levels of multiple pro-inflammatory factors in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly increased during infection, displaying hallmarks of a cytokine storm. Transcriptome sequencing further revealed systematic activation of inflammation-related pathways, predicting that viral infection induces multiple forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. Protein-level validation showed that the activation of key cell death markers, including Caspase-3, GSDMD, and MLKL, significantly increased as the infection progressed, with their dynamic changes correlating strongly with the expression pattern of viral proteins. This study elucidates the central role of the synergistic effect between the cytokine storm and multiple cell death pathways in H10N3 pathogenesis. These findings not only advance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AIVs but also provide a critical theoretical basis for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence indicate that individual host immune response to pathogens may be as important as virulence factors in determining the severity of infection. However, most available data on pathogen-host interactions are based on in vitro findings, neglecting the genetic complexity of the immune response. We conducted a comparative observational study of bacterial and viral meningitis to identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent inflammatory pathways that may predict the severity of infection by analysing 54 inflammatory factors using plexing technology. Infection severity and neurological disability were assessed using the modified RANKIN scale. To identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent pathways, plex data were entered into EMBiology®™ software and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. We also investigated pathogen- and host-dependent regulatory effects on blood-brain barrier function using human iPSC-derived endothelial cells as a model. BBB function was characterised at the level of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), endothelial apoptosis and drug transporter activity. We identified 36 factors that are highly differentially regulated in either bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis compared to healthy subjects, 15 of which have not been previously described. GSEA identified previously unknown pathogen-specific pathways including neurotrophin, NOTCH, immune tolerance, antiviral defence and tight junction signalling. As a key finding, we identified 15 host-dependent factors that correlated with the grade of disability and with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. GSEA revealed stronger responses of neuroprotective (AKT/ERK), anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/p53) and anti-inflammatory (JAK1/STAT1) pathways in patients with favourable course, whereas patients with severe infection show stronger pro-inflammatory STAT-activation, NKC/CTL-responses and NFκ-B-associated neurotoxicity. BBB analysis supports these findings with dysregulation of TEER, drug transporter activity and induction of endothelial cell death in patients with severe infection. Our data highlight the need for future approaches to personalised medicine that go beyond traditional anti-infective therapy to target the individual immune response. Author Summery Infections often cause personal suffering, but also high economic costs. Brain infections such as bacterial or viral meningitis are particularly serious and carry a high risk of death or permanent disability. At the same time, resistance to anti-infective drugs is increasing and fewer new antibiotics are being developed. As a result, there is a great need for translational research to develop new treatments beyond conventional anti-infectives. Due to its strict compartmentalisation, the brain is well suited to identify specific pathogen-dependent, but also host (patient) dependent inflammatory patterns in infections. Using a cohort of patients with a defined group of pathogen-specific meningitis, we investigated the inflammatory patterns in the cerebrospinal fluid and were able to describe new specific pathogen-dependent and new host-dependent immune responses and identify associated signalling pathways. We were also able to show how and at what cellular and molecular level the blood-brain barrier is disrupted by infection. The degree of damage to the blood-brain barrier is an important aspect and has major implications for the course and prognosis of brain infections. Once the pathogen- and host-specific aspects of the immune response are understood, new personalised therapeutic approaches can be developed that directly target the regulation of the individual immune response.">

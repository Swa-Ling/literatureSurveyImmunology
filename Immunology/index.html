        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) frequently follows allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and impacts the mucosa. This atlas study highlights the role of exhausted-like effector CD8+ T cells (TEXEF) in oral mucosal cGVHD pathogenesis. Biopsies from the oral mucosa were collected at oral cGVHD onset or at six months post-transplant and analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing and other modalities. At cGVHD onset, in addition to changes in the myeloid compartment, two distinct populations of CD8+T cells with a TEXEF phenotype were prevalent: an inflammatory CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_4) expressing CCL4, CD69, and TNFSF9, and an exhausted CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_5) characterized by the expression of CXCL13, HIF1A, and HLA-DRA, both correlated with clinical disease severity. Pseudo-time analysis suggests a transition from the inflammatory pre-exhausted CD8T_4 cluster to the cytolytic, terminally exhausted CD8T_5 cluster. The CXCL9-CXCR3 interactions among CD8+ T cells, fibroblasts and myeloid cells are implicated in tissue damage. Onset of cGVHD despite frequent oral mucosal FOXP3+ regulatory CD4+T cells suggests potential impaired Treg function or CD8+T cell dysfunction. These findings highlight TEXEF cells as key contributors to oral cGVHD pathology and potential therapeutic targets for mitigating sustained tissue injury in cGVHD.">

        <tr id="Inflammation is regulated by immune cells, with CD4+ T cells playing a key role in its progression and resolution. Modulating their response is crucial for controlling inflammation, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic target due to their immunomodulatory properties. We previously showed that umbilical cord derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) induce a memory response in TCR-activated CD4+ T cells, and here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms through gene expression analysis at different time points. Our results demonstrated that TCR activation is required for UC-MSCs to induce this memory response. Pathway analysis revealed that UC-MSCs induced the expression of genes that negatively regulate immune signalling pathways. This was further supported by phosphoflow cytometry, which showed suppression of the NF-κB and ERK pathways. Additionally, UC-MSCs enhanced the expression of genes related to CD4+ T cell adhesion and migration at 12 and 24 h.

        <tr id="Neutrophils have emerged as key players in tumor progression and are often associated with poor prognosis. Despite ongoing efforts to target neutrophil functions in cancer, therapeutic success has been limited. In this study, we addressed the possibility of blocking STAT3 signaling in neutrophils as a targeted therapeutic intervention in cancer. Conditional deletion of Stat3 in a neutrophil-specific manner (Ly6GcreStat3fl/fl mice) significantly impaired tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Neutrophils isolated from these mice exhibited a strong antitumoral phenotype, with increased MHCII, CD80/86 and ICAM-1 expression. Immune profiling of tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of these mice revealed significant enrichment of CD8+ T cells (granzymeBhi, perforinhi and IFN-γhi) with strong cytotoxic activity. To further translate these findings to human settings, we blocked STAT3 signaling in cancer patient neutrophils via the small molecule inhibitor LLL12 and assessed its effects on patient-derived tumor explants. In agreement with the in vivo mouse data, we observed the expansion and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in such explants. To test the therapeutic applicability of STAT3 targeting, we utilized myeloid cell-selective STAT3 antisense oligonucleotide (CpG-STAT3ASO) to target neutrophils in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Consistent with previous results, neutrophil-specific STAT3 knockdown impaired tumor growth and enhanced cytotoxic T cell activity in the tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of treated mice. These findings highlight STAT3 signaling as a deleterious pathway supporting the protumoral activity of neutrophils and suggest that neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition is a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy, providing novel insights into targeted therapeutic avenues.">

        <tr id="Introduction A comprehensive characterization of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is essential to advance understanding of tumor biology and guide immunotherapy development. Methods Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed 14,441 immune cells isolated from tumor tissues and paratumor tissues of three CSCC patients. By integrating data on tumor suppressors, oncogenic factors, cytokines, and chemokines, we performed differential gene expression analyses across immune populations. Results This analysis identified nine major immune cell subsets, including CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer/T cells (NK/T cells), B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and macrophages. Notably, elevated CCR7 expression in exhausted CD8+ T cells was associated with improved prognosis, suggesting it as a preliminary candidate for an immunoregulatory target that warrants further investigation. Additionally, CCL5 levels were elevated in Tregs, indicating a possible involvement in their recruitment to the tumor site that requires further validation. Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis identified candidate genes for further mechanistic investigation. Discussion This systematic comparison of the TME between tumor and paratumor tissues reveals dynamic changes in the immune landscape, providing insights and suggesting potential targets for further study to enhance understanding and treatment of CSCC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aims Sustained neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke impedes post‐injury tissue repairment and neurological functional recovery. Developing innovative therapeutic strategies that simultaneously suppress detrimental inflammatory cascades and facilitate neurorestorative processes is critical for improving long‐term rehabilitation outcomes. Methods We employed a microglia depletion‐repopulation paradigm by administering PLX5622 for 7 days post‐ischemia; followed by a 7‐day withdrawal period to allow microglia repopulation. Single‐cell transcriptomics, behavioral testing, cytokine arrays, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were used to assess the effects of microglia repopulation and delineate the transition of reshaped immune microenvironment. Results PLX5622 administration reshaped the poststroke immune microenvironment, promoting neurofunctional recovery. Repopulated microglia adopted a homeostatic phenotype, increasing homeostatic states by ~14.36% and reducing pro‐inflammatory states by ~20.17%. This reshaped environment suppressed T cell exhaustion, limited neutrophil terminal differentiation, and promoted a phagocytic macrophage phenotype. Furthermore, we identified that these transitions in infiltrating immune cells may be driven by reduced chemokine production, enhanced blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and transcriptional reprogramming. Conclusion Transient microglial depletion and repopulation via PLX5622 during the acute phase post stroke facilitate the recovery of neurological function. This immunomodulatory strategy offers a promising and clinically translationally relevant approach to enhance functional recovery following ischemic brain injury.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) and glioblastoma (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors with limited treatment options. Macrophage phagocytosis is a complex, tightly regulated process governed by competing pro-phagocytic and anti-phagocytic signals. CD47-SIRPα signaling inhibits macrophage activity, while radiotherapy (RT) can enhance tumor immunogenicity. How RT and CD47 blockade together modulate macrophage “appetite” and activation states remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of glioma immune evasion and therapy resistance. Methods Human and mouse glioma cell lines were exposed to fractionated RT, anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, or both. Flow cytometry and ELISA quantified the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and expression of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In vitro, phagocytosis assays were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze transcriptional changes in macrophage subsets that phagocytosed (“eaters”) or did not phagocytose (“non-eaters”) glioma cells. In vivo, efficacy of combination therapy was assessed using orthotopic xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of DMG and GBM. Results RT induced ICD in glioma cells, evidenced by dose-dependent increases in DAMPs such as phosphatidylserine, calreticulin, HSP70/90, and HMGB1. RT and anti-CD47 each promoted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, with a synergistic effect observed when combined. scRNA-seq of phagocytic macrophages revealed transcriptionally distinct subpopulations associated with each treatment, characterized by enrichment in inflammatory, metabolic, and antigen presentation pathways. In vivo, combination therapy significantly reduced tumor burden, extended survival, and polarized tumor-associated macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory (M1-like) phenotype. Distinct macrophage markers (CLEC7A, CD44, CD63) validated scRNA-seq findings in vivo. Conclusions This study highlights that macrophage fate is intimately linked to the molecular properties of what they phagocytose. Phagocytosis is not a singular, uniform process but a dynamic and context-dependent event that drives macrophage specialization and plasticity. By demonstrating that RT and anti-CD47 therapy shape distinct macrophage phenotypes through their effects on tumor immunogenicity, this study provides a framework for understanding how to harness and reprogram macrophage activity for therapeutic benefit. These findings underscore the potential of targeting macrophage plasticity as a strategy to enhance antitumor immunity and improve outcomes in malignant gliomas and other diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background While highly efficacious for numerous cancers, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause unpredictable and potentially severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), underscoring the need to understand irAE biology. Methods We used a multidimensional approach incorporating single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) profiling to characterize the peripheral immune landscape of patients receiving ICI therapy according to irAE development. Results Analysis of 162 patients revealed that individuals who developed clinically significant irAEs exhibited a baseline proinflammatory, autoimmune-like state characterized by a significantly higher abundance of CD57+ T and natural killer (NK) T cells, plasmablasts, proliferating and activated CXCR3+ lymphocytes, CD8+ effector and terminal effector memory T cells, along with reduced NK cells and elevated plasma ANA levels. In irAE cases, we identified distinct baseline proinflammatory gene signatures, including markedly higher expression of IL1B and CXCL8 in monocytes and CXCR3, TNF, and IFNG in T/NK cells. TNF signaling was the most enriched pathway, while immunosuppressive genes SIGLEC7 and CXCR4 were downregulated. Following ICI initiation, these patients exhibited an enhanced shift toward an activated and inflammatory immune phenotype, including monocyte reprogramming characterized by upregulation of IL18 and elevated gene expression levels of CXCL10. Conversely, post-treatment levels of CXCL8 were decreased in irAE patients. Notably, in patients who did not develop clinically significant irAE, we identified increased baseline abundance of a TGFBIhigh myeloid cluster enriched in immunosuppressive markers such as STAB1. In addition, patients without irAE exhibited upregulation of TNF and AIRE, accompanied by distinct myeloid protumorigenic reprogramming. Conclusions A pre-existing activated, autoimmune-like proinflammatory state drives the development of irAE during ICI therapy through three key axes: increased plasmablast/ANA, heightened interferon-gamma/CXCL10/CXCR3 axis, and amplified TNF signaling. These findings may serve as potential peripheral immune biomarkers for predicting irAE and provide biological insights into the mechanisms governing and mitigating irAE.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite advancements in immunotherapies, the diversity of the tumor microenvironment remains a challenge for cancer treatment. To elucidate microenvironment‐specific differences in antitumor responses, we established patient‐derived ex vivo tumor‐lung slices. We analyzed immune activation profiles after treatment with anti‐CD3/CD28 and the checkpoint inhibitor Nivolumab. Lung slices from non‐tumor, tumor‐adjacent, tumor‐border, and tumor‐central tissue were generated and assessed for viability, cell composition, and immune competence via flow cytometry, soluble factor secretion, and bulk RNA‐sequencing. The tumor‐border contained the highest number of immune cells (8.3‐fold vs. non‐tumor), secreted tumor markers (S100 and CA15‐3), and exhibited high levels of inflammatory mediators (IFNγ, IL‐6, and IL‐2). Treatment with anti‐CD3/CD28 increased the frequency of CD137+/CD8+ T cells and induced cytokine responses dominated by IFNγ, IL‐2, and Granzyme B. While both non‐tumor and tumor‐border tissue responded to anti‐CD3/CD28, the intensities of immune responses were highly varied. Notably, treatment with Nivolumab induced an inflammatory response primarily in the tumor‐border evidenced by IFNγ, IL‐2, and Perforin secretion alongside increased expression of CD107a on CD8+ T cells, in a donor‐dependent manner. Taken together, these data demonstrate how tumor‐border tissue slices can be utilized to study T cell responses in the context of the patient‐specific tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is one of the most widespread immunosuppressive viruses, impairing the protective efficacy of vaccines in pig herds. Previous studies have shown that PCV2 infection reduces the generation of immune memory and antibody secretion induced by vaccination in hosts. In this study, we used single-cell mRNA sequencing of mice splenic cells to show that PCV2 infection decelerates the differentiation of light zone germinal center (GC) B cells into memory B cells and plasma cells. We found that, although PCV2 infection led to lymphocyte depletion in the spleens of mice, the remaining splenic B cells were activated by the infection. The percentage of naïve B cells in PCV2-infected mice decreased mainly due to differentiation rather than death. Meanwhile, the percentages of memory B cells and plasma cells increased without significant enhancement of functional gene expression. Focusing on the GC B cells, we found that PCV2 infection activated the proliferation of dark zone GC B cells, but not the differentiation of light zone GC B cells. Furthermore, the transcriptional level of Prdm1 was not significantly altered by PCV2 infection, and the level of Bach2 was dramatically reduced. Further analysis showed that the interactions between light zone GC B cells and dendritic cells, macrophages, and follicular helper T cells were weakened in the spleens of PCV2-infected mice. In conclusion, this study found that PCV2 infection impairs the differentiation of B cells into functional memory B cells and plasma cells. This may be an important and previously unrecognized reason why PCV2 infection impairs vaccine efficiency.">

        <tr id="Introduction Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are critical mediators of intercellular communication and contribute to cancer progression and immune regulation. Methods We characterized EVs isolated from bone marrow (BM) plasma harvested from healthy donors and patients affected by Multiple Myeloma (MM) by Nano Tracking Analysis and by flow cytometry. Results EVs from MM patients were significantly more abundant and enriched in CD138, supporting their partial origin from malignant plasma cells, with additional input from BM resident cells, including monocytes and NK cells. Phenotypic profiling revealed increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules HLA-G, PD-1, and PD-L1 on MM-derived EVs compared to healthy controls. Functionally, MM-EVs suppressed Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced T cell activation, as evidenced by reduced IFN-γ production and CD4+ T cell proliferation. Such effects were partially reversed by HLA-G blockade. Moreover, MM-derived EVs modulated cytokine secretion profiles suppressing IL-2, IFN-α, TNF-α, and IL-6, and enhancing GM-CSF, with some changes attributed to HLA-G and PD-L1 activity. Transcriptomic analysis showed higher HLA-G expression in patients with gain of chromosome 1q, suggesting a link between high-risk cytogenetics and EV-driven immune suppression. While clinical correlations were not observed, likely due to limited sample size, these findings underscore the immunosuppressive role of MM-derived EVs. Discussion HLA-G+, PD-1+, and PD-L1+ EVs contribute to immune dysfunction in MM and represent promising targets to restore anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="B cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are associated with favorable prognosis and positive response to immunotherapy in cancer. Here we show that simultaneous activation of innate immune effectors, STING and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR), results in CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor suppression while inducing high endothelial venule development and germinal center-like B cell responses in tumors to generate functional TLS in a T cell-dependent manner. In a neoadjuvant setting, activation of STING and LTβR by their agonists effectively immunized mice against tumor recurrence, leading to long-term survival. STING activation alone was insufficient for inducing B cell-containing TLS or eliciting long-term therapeutic effects. However, when combined with LTβR activation, it improved the fitness of TLS with B cell expansion and maturation to IgG-producing long-lived plasma cells and memory cells, increased CD4+ T cell recruitment and memory CD8+ T cell expansion, and shifted the TH2/TH17 balance, resulting in the potentiation of humoral and cellular immunity against tumors. These findings suggest a therapeutic approach of simultaneously activating STING and lymphotoxin pathways.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, a first-line defender, has a multifaceted presence in chronic inflammation, autoimmune pathology, and tumor progression. The microenvironmental cues facilitate functional plasticity and phenotypic heterogeneity to neutrophils that enable both their protective and pathogenic roles. Autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) display the presence of dysregulated subsets of neutrophil, such as low-density granulocytes (LDGs) that promote proinflammation and contribute to tissue damage via NETosis and type I interferon-mediated signaling. In cancer, particularly tumors, they exhibit tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) which may polarize either towards anti-tumorigenic ‘N1’ or pro-tumorigenic ‘N2’ phenotypes based on available modulators such as TGF-β and leucine-driven epigenetic modifications. The development in neutrophil biology has introduced several novel therapeutic strategies that allow NET targeting, inhibition of chemokine receptors like CXCR2, and exploration of neutrophil-derived biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. Such findings encourage the importance of neutrophils as both effectors and therapeutic targets in inflammatory and neoplastic conditions.">

        <tr id="Microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) are the primary targets of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in humans and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in nonhuman primates, contributing to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and establishment of a persistent viral reservoir in the central nervous system (CNS). Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), neurocognitive and other neurological disorders persist in people with HIV (PWH). Opioid users can suffer exacerbated disease progression and neurological complications. However, the impact of ART-treated infection and opioids on brain myeloid cells, the main targets for HIV/SIV in the brain, remains poorly understood. Using an SIV-infected rhesus macaque model and single-cell multi-omic sequencing, we show that ART promotes the restoration of homeostatic microglial states, while morphine exerts immunosuppressive effects on brain myeloid cells. Consistent with this immunosuppression, in morphine-treated, SIV-infected ART-suppressed macaques we found that myeloid cells exhibited reduced antiviral gene expression, including downregulation of MHC class II and interferon-stimulated genes, as well as decreased activity of AP-1 and ETS transcription factors. Furthermore, through the integration of single-cell data from PWH, we found that homeostatic microglial signatures were also evident in ART-treated PWH, although the microglia from PWH exhibited more activated/inflammatory phenotypes than those from the macaque model. These findings reveal distinct effects of ART and morphine on brain myeloid cell dynamics during SIV infection, indicating potential mechanisms underlying worsened neurocognitive outcomes in opioid-using PWH.">

        <tr id="Massive immune cell infiltration and persistent inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) are key hallmarks of multiple sclerosis. Here, we report a myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)–based therapeutic strategy, named CNS Immune Targeting Enabled by MDSCs (CITED), which uses surface-decorated MDSCs carrying rapamycin nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted multimodal immune reprogramming in CNS. We show that NP decoration enhances MDSC immunomodulatory function, facilitates their trafficking to inflamed CNS regions, and increases NP accumulation within CNS. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, CITED exhibited robust therapeutic efficacy, resulting in reduced disease progression, improved motor function, and diminished myelin damage. Mechanistic studies reveal that CITED exerts its therapeutic effects by targeted reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune responses in CNS. Specifically, CITED inhibits immune cell infiltration, rebalances CD4 T cell phenotypes, and promotes the polarization of myeloid cells toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Collectively, CITED could provide a broadly effective approach for targeted immune restoration in multiple sclerosis and potentially other autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are integral components of the bone marrow and stromal cell network. They express the immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1 and can induce T cell exhaustion, thereby promoting immunosuppression. In this study, we investigated whether tumor-derived Cldn7 deficiency could recruit polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), induce their metabolic reprogramming, and consequently drive their transition toward a pro-tumor phenotype, leading to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, clinical sample validation, and both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we found that Cldn7 deficiency in colorectal cancer (CRC) results in a tumor microenvironment characterized by significantly increased infiltration of CD11b⁺ Ly6G⁺ neutrophils. This is accompanied by neutrophil metabolic reprogramming that facilitates their phenotypic shift toward a tumor-promoting state, which in turn suppresses the cytotoxic function of CD8⁺ T cells and contributes to the formation of an immunosuppressive TME, thereby accelerating CRC progression. Mechanistically, Cldn7 deficiency indirectly activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to elevated secretion of chemokines such as CXCL1 that are responsible for PMN recruitment. Inhibition of the NF-κB/CXCL1 axis reduces PMN infiltration, decreases PD-L1 expression on neutrophils, suppresses neutrophil glycolysis and histone lactylation, reverses the exhausted phenotype of CD8⁺ T cells, thereby mitigating the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Furthermore, overexpression of Cldn7 enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.Collectively, our findings indicate that Cldn7 deficiency not only contributes to immune evasion and malignant progression in CRC but also plays a critical role in immune modulation. Targeting PMN metabolic reprogramming and immunosuppressive function associated with Cldn7 loss may offer a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy in CRC.">

        <tr id="The immune ecosystem is central to maintaining effective defensive responses. However, it remains largely understudied how immune cells in the peripheral blood interact with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastasis. Here, blood analysis of patients with advanced breast cancer revealed that over 75% of CTC-positive blood specimens contained heterotypic CTC clusters with CD45+ white blood cells (WBCs), which correlates with breast cancer subtypes, racial groups, and decreased survival. CTC-WBC clusters included overrepresented T cells and underrepresented neutrophils. Specifically, a rare subset of CD4 and CD8 double-positive T (DPT) cells was 140-fold enriched in CTC clusters versus their frequency in WBCs. DPT cells shared properties with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but exhibited unique features of T cell exhaustion and immune suppression. Mechanistically, the integrin heterodimer α4β1, also named very late antigen 4 (VLA-4), in DPT cells and its ligand, VCAM1, in tumor cells are essential mediators of DPT-CTC clusters. Neoadjuvant administration of anti-VLA-4 neutralizing antibodies markedly blocked CTC–DPT clusters, inhibited metastasis, and extended mouse survival. These findings highlight a pivotal role of rare DPT cells in fostering cancer dissemination through CTC clustering. It lays a foundation for developing innovative biomarker-guided therapeutic strategies to prevent and target cancer metastasis.">

        <tr id="The role of bone marrow (BM) compensatory response in autoimmune hemolytic anemias (AIHAs) is emerging and inadequate reticulocytosis has been associated with more severe disease and adverse outcomes. However, few is known about the BM immunologic microenvironment composition in these diseases. Here we investigated BM features in a large cohort of 97 patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and observed a high prevalence of hypercellularity, dyserythropoiesis, reticulin fibrosis, and T-cell infiltration (65%, 29%, 76%, and 69% of patients, respectively). These findings were associated with inadequate bone marrow compensation, more severe anemia at onset, and need of multiple treatments. In a subset of warm type AIHA patients we investigated BM microenvironment by single-cell RNA sequencing. We found distinct immune cell profiles across disease stages (diagnosis, remission, relapse). In particular, upregulation of inflammatory response pathways was noted in CD8 + , CD4 + , and monocyte subsets during relapse compared to diagnosis and remission. Moreover, by single-cell TCR sequencing, we found small T cell clones at diagnosis that may either disappeared or expanded at remission. Disappearing clones exhibited a naive CD8+ phenotype and were more likely to respond to glucocorticoid treatment. Expanding clones showed upregulation of cytotoxic T cell markers and may play a role in the transition to a chronic/relapsing phase. Finally, cytokine gene expression differed across disease phases. At relapse, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 were upregulated in CD4+ and CD8 + T cells, while TGF-beta was downregulated, potentially in an attempt to counteract the transition to chronic phase. This is the largest study evaluating BM histology and clinical characteristics, and the first evaluation of BM microenvironment by single-cell RNA sequencing in AIHA. We showed a complex scenario encompassing T-cell infiltration, clonality, and up/down-regulation of cytokine genes, associated with a more severe and relapsing disease.">

NK cells are correlated with increased tumor control and better overall patient survival across various types of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite their promising potential for anti-tumor killing, NK cell function is often diminished within the tumor microenvironment. There are many factors that lead to decreased tumor-infiltrating NK cell killing, including immunoinhibitory factors from tumor cells and resident tissues, acquired immune tolerance, NK cell exhaustion, and the hypoxic state of the tumor microenvironment. Unleashing NK cell activity therefore has high potential to create a new class of immunotherapy that could combat both primary and acquired resistance to current checkpoint inhibitors. In this review we discuss mechanistic details of NK cell tumor killing, NK cell immunosuppression, and gaps in knowledge regarding highly complex microenvironment-specific effects on NK cell function. We also discuss the promise and limitations of emerging NK-cell based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with its progression shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic factors but also by a complex and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Within this niche, diverse immune populations—including CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cell subsets (Th1, Th17, Tregs), B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—collectively regulate immune surveillance and tumor escape. While effector lymphocytes mediate antitumor responses, their function is often attenuated by TAM- and MDSC-driven immunosuppression via cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), metabolic disruption, and immune checkpoint expression. High densities of M2-polarized TAMs and MDSCs correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have improved outcomes in lung cancer, yet therapeutic efficacy remains limited by the immunosuppressive TME. This review outlines the functional roles of key immune cell subsets in lung cancer and highlights emerging strategies to reprogram the TME and enhance immunotherapeutic responsiveness.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Numerous studies have demonstrated the promising efficacy of granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) in the treatment of couples with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (URPL) during early pregnancy. While neutrophils are recognised as the main effectors mediating immunoregulation, their G‐CSF‐mobilised phenotype and mechanisms regulating maternal–fetal immunity remain unclear. Methods Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) and single‐cell T‐cell receptor sequencing (scTCR‐seq) were conducted to uncover the immune reconstitution dynamics of peripheral blood under G‐CSF stimulation. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic‐proteomic profiles with functional validation revealed a unique immunomodulatory neutrophil population. Further, we used spatial transcriptomics, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of this population at the maternal–fetal interface, and validated its therapeutic efficacy in animal models. Results G‐CSF‐mobilised peripheral blood (G‐PB) displayed immune hyporesponsiveness. Unique neutrophils expressing high levels of CD177 and the S100A gene family expanded substantially in response to G‐CSF. These neutrophils exhibited a comparatively immature morphology and impaired T‐cell responses via contact‐dependent arginase 1 release, as well as upregulation of T‐cell immune checkpoints. A reduction of CD177+S100Ahi neutrophils was observed in both peripheral blood and decidua of URPL patients relative to healthy pregnant women. Functional validation in abortion‐prone murine models confirmed that exogenous supplementation of G‐CSF or adoptive transfer of CD177+S100Ahi neutrophils could successfully improve the pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion G‐CSF played a crucial regulatory role in improving pregnancy outcomes by selectively expanding CD177⁺S100Ahi neutrophils with polymorphonuclear myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (PMN‐MDSCs) properties, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the treatment of patients with URPL using G‐CSF. Key points G‐CSF induces peripheral blood immune hyporesponsiveness in patients with UPRL. First to characterize G‐CSF mobilised CD177+S100Ahi neutrophils displayed PMN‐MDSCs properties. Both CD177+S100Ahi‐LDNs and CD177+S100Ahi‐NDNs induce T cell hyporesponsiveness through coordinated activation of the ARG1/L‐Arg metabolic axis and synergistic upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules. CD177+S100Ahi neutrophils are diminished in the peripheral blood and decidua of patients with UPRL.">

        <tr id="Since their discovery, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have emerged as key players in immune regulation, tissue homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis. Early research focused on defining ILC subsets, including ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, by distinguishing their development, transcriptional profiles, and effector functions relative to T cells. Subsequent studies characterized the tissue-resident nature of ILCs and mapped their context-dependent phenotypes across diverse organs. In parallel, increasing evidence linked ILC subset imbalances to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and various cancers. Recent work has leveraged circulating ILC frequencies and phenotypes as potential biomarkers for disease severity and progression. Notably, the immunomodulatory, tissue-reparative, and cytotoxic functions of helper ILCs have attracted interest as novel therapeutic avenues. Current strategies to harness ILCs for therapy include ex vivo expansion of autologous or allogeneic ILCs, derivation of ILC-like cells from umbilical cord blood or pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), and engineering of ILCs with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to enhance antigen specificity. Additionally, cytokine modulation and immune checkpoint blockade are being explored to sustain or redirect ILC function in disease contexts. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the functional diversity, plasticity, and tissue residency of ILC subsets, emphasizing their interactions with other immune and stromal cells, and their roles as predictive, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases and cancers. Key translational challenges, including subset heterogeneity, plasticity, tissue-restricted residency, and limited scalability, remain barriers to clinical application. However, emerging multi-omic technologies, single-cell atlases, and synthetic biology approaches are accelerating efforts to map ILC states with unprecedented resolution and guide rational therapeutic design. Looking forward, integration of ILC-based therapies with regenerative medicine, cellular engineering, and immuno-oncology platforms holds promise for developing next-generation precision immunotherapies. By bridging fundamental biology with translational innovation, this field is poised to expand the therapeutic landscape for both autoimmune and malignant diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors have traditionally been understood to exert their effects primarily within the tumor microenvironment, particularly targeting CD8 + T cells. However, recent studies have highlighted a pivotal role of tumor-draining lymph nodes in mediating responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study aimed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which tumor-draining lymph nodes respond to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and regulate the tumor microenvironment in human colorectal cancer. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing on tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumor tissues from patients with colorectal cancer. Through in-depth analysis of the single-cell data, we established the connection between TDLNs and tumor, and explored the impact of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy on the immune microenvironment of tumor-draining lymph nodes. In addition, we conducted animal experiments to validate these findings. Results Our findings revealed that immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment induced the expansion of tumor-specific CD8 + effector memory T cells within tumor-draining lymph nodes, which may serve as a source for the progenitor-exhausted CD8 + T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, conventional dendritic cells type 1 and macrophages within tumor-draining lymph nodes facilitated this process. We also observed that immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy promoted the expansion of tumor-specific CD4 + follicular helper T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which may explain the increase of CD4 + follicular helper T cells in the tumor microenvironment after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. These hypotheses were corroborated through experiments in mice. Conclusions Our findings delineate the critical regulatory function of tumor-draining lymph nodes in modulating the tumor microenvironment during Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

        <tr id="Retinoic acid (RA) plays a key role in mucosal immune regulation and tolerance, with implications for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, its effects have not been extensively studied in humanized in vitro models that recapitulate epithelial–immune interactions. We established a 3D in vitro small intestinal model composed of three epithelial cell types, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocyte/dendritic cell (M/DC) precursors derived from CD34+ umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The epithelial microenvironment strongly suppressed monocyte/DC differentiation and T cell activation, indicating a regulatory role of epithelial-derived signals. Retinoic acid (RA) priming of M/DC precursors induced CD103+CD11b+Sirp1α− regulatory DCs and promoted a shift from naive to memory-type T cells. Upon addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β), the model mimicked an inflamed intestinal state, resulting in CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes and increased T cell activation (CD25+CD69+). RA-primed DCs modestly counterbalanced T cell activation and IBD-like responses, even under inflammatory conditions. Flow cytometry and clustering analysis revealed distinct immune cell phenotypes depending on RA exposure and cytokine context. This model provides a reproducible and physiologically relevant human system to study RA-mediated immune programming in the intestinal mucosa and may support the development of novel therapeutic strategies for IBD and related inflammatory conditions. Statistical differences were evaluated using ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test (n = 4; p < 0.05).">

        <tr id="Background Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive hematologic malignancy, with the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype displaying particularly poor prognosis due to inherent treatment resistance and elevated recurrence rates. Despite advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, a significant proportion of patients experience relapse or refractory disease, highlighting the urgent need for novel biomarkers and innovative therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes. Methods A multi-dimensional analysis of SH3BP5 expression was performed across DLBCL subtypes, integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical datasets to assess its correlation with immune infiltration, tumor metabolism, and patient prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing data were employed to examine the tumor microenvironment (TME) with higher resolution. Further analysis of the association between SH3BP5 and immune checkpoint gene expression was conducted to explore its potential role in immunotherapy response. Functional in vitro assays were carried out to assess the impact of SH3BP5 knockdown on DLBCL cell proliferation and apoptosis. Results The analysis revealed that SH3BP5 is preferentially overexpressed in the ABC subtype of DLBCL across multiple datasets and validated cohorts, and its high expression is significantly associated with poor overall survival. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that SH3BP5 is mainly expressed in malignant B cells and inversely correlated with immune cell infiltration, particularly CD8 + T cells. Mechanistically, pathway enrichment and metabolic assays indicated that SH3BP5 is linked to mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and potentially contributing to reduced responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Functional studies showed that SH3BP5 knockdown significantly suppressed DLBCL cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced tumor cell viability in vitro. Conclusion This study suggests that SH3BP5 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in DLBCL, particularly within the ABC subtype. By delineating its associations with immune evasion and metabolic reprogramming, these findings provide a mechanistic basis for further exploration of SH3BP5-targeted interventions to help overcome therapy resistance. Future studies in larger clinical cohorts and functional models are warranted to validate these results and assess the potential of integrating SH3BP5 expression profiling into precision medicine strategies for DLBCL.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, yet most patients fail to achieve durable responses. To better understand the tumor microenvironment (TME), we analyze single-cell RNA-seq (~189 K cells) from 36 metastatic melanoma samples, defining 14 cell types, 55 subtypes, and 15 transcriptional hallmarks of malignant cells. Correlations between cell subtype proportions reveal six distinct clusters, with a mature dendritic cell subtype enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDC) linked to naive T and B cells. Importantly, mregDC abundance predicts progression-free survival (PFS) with ICIs and other therapies, especially when combined with the TCF7 + /– CD8 T cell ratio. Analysis of an independent cohort (n = 318) validates mregDC as a predictive biomarker for anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapies. Further characterization of mregDCs versus conventional dendritic cells (cDC1/cDC2) highlights their unique transcriptional, epigenetic (single-nucleus ATAC-seq data for cDCs from 14 matched samples), and interaction profiles, offering new insights for improving immunotherapy response and guiding future combination treatments.">

        <tr id="Administration of IL-2 may promote the suppressive function and proliferation of Treg cells that cause immune tolerance in patients with cancer, which causes low-dose IL-2 to fail in achieving an optimal anti-tumor effect. Here, we designed an immunocytokine by fusing IL-2 and an anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody, named αTIGIT-IL2, that targets Treg cells and promotes their fragility in the tumor milieu. These fragile-like Treg cells show impaired suppressive function and high IFN-γ production, triggering an immune-reactive tumor microenvironment. Such inflammation leads to the recruitment and functional reprogramming of intratumoral neutrophils, improving cross-talk between neutrophils and CD8+ T cells and enhancing the antitumor ability of CD8+ T cells. Combination therapy with αTIGIT-IL2 and PD-1 blocker could eliminate triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. These findings provide the basis for developing a new generation of immunocytokines that target Treg cells and promote their fragility in the tumor milieu, resulting in robust antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="The release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as ATP from stressed or damaged cells is a key initiator of sterile inflammation. In autoimmune diseases, extracellular ATP acts as a potent pro-inflammatory signal by activating the purinergic receptor P2X7, which is expressed on both mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) and T cells—key drivers of pathological processes. While it is well established that P2X7 mediates ATP-dependent immune activation, its cell-specific contributions to innate versus adaptive immunity in autoimmune conditions remain unclear, especially in autoimmune uveitis. Here we used the experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) mouse model to delineate the cellular mechanisms underlying P2X7’s role in autoimmune responses. Using a combination of multiple cell-specific conditional models and transcriptomic approaches, we showed a pivotal role forP2X7 expressed by MPs in orchestrating T-cell mediated autoimmune responses. P2X7 deficiency in MPs decreased disease severity. Additionally, cell-specific transcriptomic analyses, including single-cell analyses, revealed that P2X7 exerted distinct modulatory effects across monocyte-derived macrophages (MdM) versus microglia. In MdM, lack of P2X7 was associated with reduced expression of genes related to the inflammasome, phagocytosis pathways, and components of the complement system, leading to a marked decrease in pathogenic Th17 cell frequency in the retina. In microglia, P2X7 deficiency instead particularly impacted an IFN-responsive microglial subset that is normally characteristic of EAU. By specifically deleting P2X7 in microglia, we demonstrate its role in driving pathogenic processes in this cell population. These findings suggest that inhibition of P2X7 could be a promising therapeutic strategy in autoimmune neuroinflammatory disorders.

Myeloid cells are frequently found in the tumor microenvironment and their infiltration correlates with survival and response to treatment. High myeloid infiltration is typically a poor prognostic factor, and the immune suppressive and prometastatic roles of myeloid cells are well established. However, there is an increasing appreciation of the antitumor functions performed by myeloid cells, which include direct tumor cell killing, phagocytosis, antigen presentation and T and natural killer cell recruitment. Moreover, advances in immune phenotyping have uncovered myeloid subsets with positive prognostic significance, including subsets correlating with higher response rates to immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent progress in mapping and dissecting the opposing effects of myeloid cells on cancer progression and immunotherapy response. The overall impact of myeloid cells is context-dependent, and combination therapies are needed to leverage the antitumor potential of these cells.">

        <tr id="Although checkpoint immunotherapy has primarily focused on CD8⁺ T cells, emerging evidence highlights an important role for cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in mediating therapeutic responses. However, research on the functional properties of cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in the context of immunotherapy is still at an early stage and remains insufficiently defined. Utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets obtained from metastatic melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, we performed transcriptomic profiling of conventional CD4⁺ T cells, excluding proliferative and regulatory (FOXP3⁺) subsets, and compared responders and non-responders as distinct groups. Importantly, our analysis identified distinct clusters that discriminate between responders and non-responders, with cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells occupying a central position within these clusters. In responder-specific clusters, cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells exhibited features of early activation, whereas clusters specific to non-responders were characterized by an exhausted phenotype. Notably, non-responder-specific clusters were positioned proximally to Treg-like clusters, suggesting a potential transition from cytotoxic to regulatory CD4⁺ T cell states in non-responders. Our findings reinforce the emerging concept that cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells play a central role in mediating immunotherapy responses. These results provide a foundation for the development of predictive biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating CD4⁺ T cell differentiation.

        <tr id="Background and objective Tumor antigen–escape variants undermine immunotherapy by subverting lymphocyte effector functions and reshaping tumor–immune dynamics. It is essential to delineate functional interplay within immune networks during tumor progression. We investigated whether homeostatic crosstalk between CD8+T cells and natural killer (NK) cells preempts tumor antigen–escape. Methods Adoptive CD8+T cell transfers were administered before (D–7, homeostatic pre-priming) or after (D+1) tumor establishment in Rag1−/− and Rag1−/−γc−/− mice. Antigen presentation, immune activation, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory were quantified by flow cytometry, live bioluminescence and confocal imaging. Monoculture, co-culture, and a 3D silica nanofiber carpet mimicking basement-membrane-like topography modeled intercellular interactions. Signaling arrays and motion metrics (Speed-Distance Index, deceleration) were conducted. Human ligand–receptor pairs engaged in CD8+T–NK crosstalk were probed in silico. Results and discussion Pre-tumor D–7 CD8+T cell transfer completely suppressed antigen–escape tumors with NK cells as major effectors showing elevated CD25, CD69, CD107a, and GzmB, marking activated and effector phenotype, and promoting central-memory CD62L⁺CD44⁺CD8⁺TCM precursors. By contrast, post-tumor D+1–transferred CD8+T cells allowed emergence of tumor variants resistant to antigen-specific cytolysis as assessed on day 25, despite those T cells retaining higher intrinsic cytotoxic capacity than the D–7 T cell cohort. Mechanistically, CD8+T and NK cells formed stable contacts through pseudopodial intercellular nanotubes enabling bidirectional membrane exchange and signaling via STAT, Akt, and mTOR pathways, augmenting NK effector function and promoting CD8+TCM differentiation. In silico analysis identified human ligand–receptor pairs engaged in CD8+T–NK adhesion, stimulatory and regulatory axes, including CD200–CD200R, PD-L1–PD-1, and CD18/CD11a–DNAM-1 (CD226). Together, data support a three-phase model of preemptive immunosurveillance initiated by early CD8⁺T–NK crosstalk. Conclusion Homeostatic conditioning and effector cooperativity between CD8+T and NK cells protect against tumor immune escape. The findings uncover a mechanistic axis of preemptive immunosurveillance that lays the foundation for next-generation preventive immunotherapies to control antigen–escape tumors.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The sustained effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) treatment is limited to a subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, highlighting the need to identify targetable biomarkers that synergize with PD1 blockade. Abnormal cholesterol metabolism plays a critical role in HCC progression, along with growing evidence indicating its complex immunomodulatory effects within the tumor microenvironment. However, the interplay between cholesterol homeostasis and immune evasion remains elusive. Methods Transcriptomic and clinical data from HCC datasets were analyzed to identify cholesterol metabolism-related targets. Multiplex immunostaining and flow cytometry were applied to examine the immune landscape association with squalene epoxidase (SQLE) in human and murine tumors. Mechanistic studies were conducted in vitro, and co-culture experiments of tumor cells and T cells were followed by metabolomics and transcriptome analyses. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in mouse HCC models. Results We demonstrated that elevated SQLE expression in human HCC was associated with poor clinical outcomes and correlated with reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of SQLE in tumor cells promoted CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation in co-culture experiments. Untargeted metabolomics identified 27-hydrocholesterol, an oxysterol derived from tumor cells, as a key factor impairing CD8+ T cell function via cholesterol dysregulation. SQLE inhibition in tumor cells suppressed oxysterols secretion, therefore overcoming cholesterol restrictions and enhancing the immune responses of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, SQLE targeting with terbinafine restored antitumor immunity and synergized with anti-PD1 therapy in HCC. Conclusion Targeting tumorous SQLE restores CD8+ T cell function by overcoming cholesterol restrictions via oxysterol-SREBP2 signaling, highlighting SQLE as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC.">

Tumors with non-inflamed, “cold” microenvironments exclude cytotoxic lymphocytes and evade checkpoint blockade. Innate nucleic acid-sensing pathways—including TLRs, RIG-I-like RNA sensors, and the cGAS–STING DNA-sensing axis—can recondition this hostile landscape by licensing dendritic cells, restoring antigen presentation, and recruiting effector T and NK cells. In this review, we synthesize mechanistic insights into how these receptors function across tumor and immune compartments and evaluate recent translational advances spanning small-molecule and nucleic acid agonists, engineered delivery systems, and clinical trials. We highlight challenges that have limited clinical impact, including pathway silencing, systemic toxicity, and lack of predictive biomarkers, while emphasizing emerging solutions such as tumor-intrinsic targeting, CAR-T/NK engineering, and biomarker-guided patient selection.

        <tr id="Background The immune-balancing role of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) is well-recognized in contexts of immune dysregulation. Within the anti-tumor context, Tα1 demonstrated to act as an immune-enhancer, with potential roles in immunotherapy-based treatments. However, Tα1 immunomodulatory potential on tumor cells is poorly understood. Additionally, Tα1 pleiotropic effects on immune cells require in-depth investigations to unravel its specific impact on different immune cell populations. Thus, we first aimed to investigate whether Tα1 treatments influenced the transcriptional immune profile of various cancer cell lines. Alongside, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, B, and natural killer cells from healthy donors (HDs) were treated individually with Tα1, to assess its direct effects on each immune cell population. Methods Cutaneous melanoma, glioblastoma, and pleural mesothelioma cell lines and HD immune cell subsets were treated with Tα1 for 48 hours. Total RNA was subsequently isolated, and gene expression profiles were analyzed by the nCounter® SPRINT Profiler. Genes with a log2ratio ≥0.58 and ≤−0.58 in Tα1-treated vs untreated cells were defined as differentially expressed (DEGs) and subsequently evaluated for the enrichment of Gene Ontology terms to identify biological processes potentially affected by Tα1 in tumor and immune cells. Results Tα1 minimally changed cancer cell DEGs and immune-related biological processes, suggesting a comprehensive lack of transcriptional immunomodulatory potential on the tumor counterpart. Conversely, Tα1 exhibited to directly affect the proliferation and/or transcription processes of each studied immune cell subset, with the greatest transcriptional impact observed for activated CD8+ T cells, crucial players in anti-tumor immunity. Conclusion Our findings question the tumor immunomodulatory properties of Tα1, simultaneously underscoring the importance of further investigating Tα1 influence on specific immune cell subsets in the periphery or within the tumor microenvironment of cancer patients. This would contribute to understand Tα1 potential in immunotherapy-based combination strategies, within the anti-tumor setting.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Type I interferons (IFNs) play complex roles during bacterial infections. We previously found that type I IFNs were induced in Bordetella pertussis-infected adult mice but not in infant mice, a potentially relevant clinical dichotomy, since pertussis can be fatal in human infants. We investigated the role of type I IFNs and their cross-regulation with type III IFNs (IFN-λ) in B. pertussis infection across developmental stages. In contrast to global IFNAR1 knockout adult mice, in which lung inflammation was equivalent to that in wild-type mice, myeloid cell-specific deficiency of the type I IFN receptor protein IFNAR1 (LysMCreIFNAR1fl/fl) resulted in significantly reduced lung inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, despite elevated pulmonary IFN-λ levels. Mechanistically, we found that, in contrast to WT macrophages, IFNAR1-deficient macrophages produced IFN-λ in response to B. pertussis or pertussis toxin, a process dependent on the G protein-coupled receptor lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1). IFNAR1 deficiency did not affect type I IFN expression or killing capacity by macrophages and neutrophils. In striking contrast to WT infant mice, which developed resistance to lethal B. pertussis infection by postnatal day 10 (P10), LysMCreIFNAR1fl/fl infant mice remained highly susceptible to lethal infection through P21, exhibiting increased lung bacterial burden and inflammation, as well as increased bacterial dissemination compared to WT infant mice. These findings reveal a critical age- and cell-specific interplay between type I and III IFNs during B. pertussis infection and highlight a novel LPAR1-dependent pathway for IFN-λ induction in the absence of type I IFN signaling.">

Despite decades of use of standard immunosuppressive therapy, treatment responses remain variable, and many patients experience relapses or develop end-stage renal disease. This review synthesizes emerging insights into the immunopathogenesis of LN, drawing on studies from single-cell transcriptomics, signaling pathway analyses and renal tissue immunology. It examines the role of both innate and adaptive immune cells in mediating disease. The therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving with novel biologics targeting B cell survival and cytokine signaling, small-molecule inhibitors modulating intracellular pathways, and promising developments in cell-based interventions. Notably, recent clinical case series have demonstrated that CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy can induce durable drug-free remission in LN, representing a transformative approach to immune modulation. These advances are further supported by the application of multi-omics platforms to refine biomarker-driven disease monitoring and personalized treatment. Integrating immunologic and technological innovations holds the potential to redefine therapeutic strategies in LN. Precision medicine approaches that leverage targeted therapies, immune resetting modalities, and biomarker-guided clinical decisions may significantly improve long-term renal outcomes and patient quality of life.">

The macrophage–NK cell interplay can either promote or suppress immune responses depending on the context, representing both a challenge and a therapeutic opportunity. NK cells are key effectors capable of recognising and eliminating malignant cells without prior sensitisation, whereas macrophages exhibit remarkable plasticity, functioning as either promoters or suppressors of tumour immunity depending on their activation state. This review focuses on current strategies to harness macrophages in cancer therapy, including phenotype repolarisation, selective depletion, and disruption or enhancement of the macrophage-NK cell crosstalk to enhance NK cell-mediated tumour surveillance. Finally, we highlight emerging technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics, as powerful tools to elucidate the dynamic interplay between macrophages and NK cells and inform the next generation of immunotherapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Mounting evidence shows that myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) reprogramming can significantly enhance the outcomes of immunotherapy. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting MDSCs alone is limited by persistent immunosuppressive cytokines and cellular crosstalk. In our previous study, we found that novel cryo‐thermal therapy (CTT) can drive MDSCs maturation and induce CD4+ T helper type (Th)1‐dominant differentiation, improving long‐term survival in spontaneous high metastatic mouse models. Considering the established roles of Interleukin (IL)‐6 and IL‐17A in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression and immune evasion, we developed a combination strategy integrating cytokine neutralization with CTT (combination therapy) in LLC1 tumor‐bearing mice. Although the combination therapy successfully promoted MDSCs maturation and Th1 differentiation, the underlying mechanistic basis remained unclear. Methods The combination therapy was implemented in LLC1 tumor‐bearing mice. We then observed its impacts on MDSCs maturation and Th1 differentiation and explored the related mechanisms by examining various aspects including the expression of CD40, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF‐κB) pathway, and the induction of tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α). Results It was observed that the combination therapy increased the expression of CD40 on MDSCs through the ROS‐NF‐κB pathway‐dependent TNF‐α induction. This TNF‐α‐mediated CD40 upregulation facilitated Th1 polarization via CD40L engagement on CD4+ T cells. Our results provided the first mechanistic evidence that autocrine TNF‐α production by reprogrammed MDSCs governs CD40 expression following combination therapy. Conclusion Our research elucidated the methods and mechanisms of MDSCs reprogramming and offered a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with NSCLC and other types of cancer.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ), are markedly elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis (ICI-M). Endomyocardial biopsies from these patients also show GBP-associated inflammasome overexpression. While both factors are implicated in ICI-M pathophysiology, their interplay and cellular targets remain poorly characterized. Our aim was to elucidate how ICI-M-associated cytokines affect the viability and inflammatory responses of endothelial cells (ECs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs) using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived models. ECs and CMs were differentiated from the same hiPSC line derived from a healthy donor. Cells were exposed either to IFN-γ alone or to an inflammatory cytokine cocktail (CCL5, GZMB, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α). We assessed large-scale transcriptomic changes via microarray and evaluated inflammatory, apoptotic, and cell death pathways at cellular and molecular levels. hiPSC-ECs were highly sensitive to cytokine exposure, displaying significant mortality and marked transcriptomic changes in immunity- and inflammation-related pathways. In contrast, hiPSC-CM showed limited transcriptional changes and reduced susceptibility to cytokine-induced death. In both cell types, cytokine treatment upregulated key components of the inflammasome pathway, including regulators (GBP5, GBP6, P2X7, NLRC5), a core component (AIM2), and the effector GSDMD. Increased GBP5 expression and CASP-1 cleavage mirrored the findings found elsewhere in endomyocardial biopsies from ICI-M patients. This hiPSC-based model reveals a distinct cellular sensitivity to ICI-M-related inflammation, with endothelial cells showing heightened vulnerability. These results reposition endothelial dysfunction, rather than cardiomyocyte injury alone, as a central mechanism in ICI-induced myocarditis. Modulating endothelial inflammasome activation, particularly via AIM2 inhibition, could offer a novel strategy to mitigate cardiac toxicity while preserving antitumor efficacy.">

        <tr id="Currently approved type 1 diabetes (T1D) immunotherapies broadly target T cells and delay but do not fully prevent diabetes development, highlighting the need for more selective targets. Anti-insulin germinal center B cells are uniquely able to present pathogenic insulin epitopes and drive anti-insulin T cells to adopt a T follicular helper fate. T cell expression of BCL6, a key transcriptional repressor in the germinal center response, is essential for spontaneous diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. However, the impact of T cells on pro-pathogenic anti-insulin B cell activity is still poorly understood. Here, we show that VH125SD.NOD mice with T cell loss of BCL6 still produce peripheral anti-insulin B cells yet are protected against diabetes (relative to Bcl6-sufficient controls). This protection was associated with reduced activation, proliferation, germinal center differentiation, and pancreatic infiltration of insulin-binding B cells. Minimally supervised analysis revealed insulin-binding B cells skew towards atypical memory B cell subsets specifically in pancreas and pancreatic lymph nodes, which was reduced by Bcl6ΔCD4 loss. Overall, this work suggests BCL6-expressing T cells are pivotal to license pathogenic insulin-binding B cells. Our findings support BCL6 inhibition as a promising T1D immunotherapy, even after insulin autoimmunity is established in the B cell repertoire.">

        <tr id="T cell responses are generally curtailed by suppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) that prevent T cell infiltration and function. Consequently, T cell-based therapies for solid tumors have yielded limited and often non-durable clinical responses. Tumors develop a hostile TME, where tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that initially support T cells are converted into immune suppressive TAMs that facilitate tumor evasion from T cell control. In fact, immune suppressive TAMs represent a dominant fraction of immune cells within the TME and their presence is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to immunotherapy. Often in close contact with effector T cells, TAMs directly suppress CD8+ T cells through mechanisms involving metabolic mediators, co-signaling receptors, their ligands and/or cytokines. Here, we revisit molecular interactions behind TAM-mediated suppression of T cell responses and address the potential targeting of such molecules and pathways to re-boost anti-tumor T cell immunity. This perspective, focusing on molecular interactions between TAM and T cells, may aid the improvement of T cell-based therapies for solid tumors.">

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a key role in cancer progression and immune modulation, critically influencing the efficacy of ICIs. Recent advances in single‐cell technologies have enabled high‐resolution profiling of the TME, particularly tumor‐infiltrating immune cells, across diverse cancer types. However, our understanding of how immune cells shape ICI responses and how they are dynamically altered during treatment remains incomplete. In this review, we summarize recent progress in characterizing TME features associated with ICI responsiveness, highlighting key immune cell subsets involved in ICI therapy and emphasizing their phenotypic plasticity and functional adaptability following ICIs. Additionally, we outline the spatial architecture of the TME in terms of its effects on immune cell behavior and interactions, and discuss the critical role of stromal components and the microbiota in modulating the immune landscape and influencing ICI responsiveness. By integrating these insights, we aim to deepen our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ICI responses, elucidate determinants of therapeutic sensitivity and resistance, and inform the development of more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Invasive candidiasis, primarily caused by Candida albicans, represents the most common fungal disease among hospitalized patients and poses a significant threat to human health. Intrinsic or acquired immunosuppression serves as a critical risk factor predisposing individuals to this disease, while simultaneously reducing the efficacy of conventional antifungal therapies and worsening clinical outcomes. Given the central role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of invasive candidiasis, immunotherapeutic strategies hold substantial promise. We targeted dectin-1, the primary pattern recognition receptor for β-1,3-glucan, by engineering XJ104, a bispecific T-cell engager that fuses dectin-1 to the light chains of an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. This construct is designed to bridge Candida β-1,3-glucan with CD3 on T cells, thereby inducing anti-Candida immunity. Our results demonstrate that XJ104 exhibits high specificity for β-1,3-glucan and activates effector cells in a Candida-dependent manner in vitro. In murine models, XJ104 enhances Th1 and Th17 responses and confers significant protection against both C. albicans and non-albicans infections. Crucially, CD3+ T-cell depletion and cytokine neutralization abolished this protection, confirming the T-cell-dependent protective efficacy of XJ104. These results establish that enhancing the endogenous T-cell function represents an effective strategy against invasive candidiasis. In conclusion, our study presents a novel therapeutic approach that bridges T cells and Candida pathogens, promoting robust Candida-specific immunity and controlling invasive infections caused by Candida spp. These findings underscore the potential of XJ104 as a clinically promising immunotherapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.">

        <tr id="Immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function, profoundly impacts cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes by fostering a tumor-promoting microenvironment and impairing immune surveillance. This review delineates eleven molecular hallmarks of immunosenescence, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation, which collectively drive immune cell dysfunction and systemic immunosuppression. Aging reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) through recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP), and metabolic reprogramming, contributing to therapy resistance and poor prognosis in elderly patients. While immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) cells show promise, their efficacy in aging populations is limited by T cell exhaustion, myeloid bias, and altered intercellular communication. Emerging strategies—including senolytics, epigenetic modulators (e.g., histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor), and metabolic interventions (e.g., spermidine, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN))—highlight potential avenues to rejuvenate aged immunity. Single-cell multi-omics (single cell RNA-seq, single cell ATAC-seq) further unravel immune cell heterogeneity, revealing tissue-specific chromatin accessibility dynamics and novel targets like interleukin-34 (IL-34) for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. However, challenges persist in translating preclinical findings to clinical practice, necessitating age-tailored trials and biomarker-driven approaches. By integrating mechanistic insights with translational innovations, this review underscores the urgency of addressing immunosenescence to optimize cancer immunotherapy for aging populations, ultimately bridging the gap between aging biology and precision oncology.">

Here, we present a novel strategy harnessing acute transplant rejection mechanisms by employing a recombinant oncolytic rVMG vector engineered to express the murine H-2Kk MHC class I alloantigen (rVMG-H-2Kk), thereby inducing tumor-specific antigenic mismatch responses. In vitro, rVMG-H-2Kk exhibited strong replication and cytolytic activity while inducing cell surface expression of both H-2Kk and endogenous H-2Kb, in addition to upregulation of antigen presentation genes (β2-microglobulin, Tap1, and Tapbp). In two independent immunocompetent PDAC models, intratumoral and systemic delivery of rVMG-H-2Kk delayed tumor progression and prolonged survival. Multiplex immunohistochemistry and immunophenotyping revealed substantial TME remodeling, marked by increased effector T-cell infiltration, regulatory T-cell depletion, and reduced fibrosis. Spatial transcriptomics further showed compartment-specific immune activation and epithelial metabolic reprogramming, corroborating with enhanced tumor immunogenicity. Despite these effects, rVMG-H-2Kk also induced compensatory immunosuppressive pathways, including upregulation of antiviral response genes and immune checkpoint receptors such as PDL-2. Importantly, combination therapy with rVMG-H-2Kk and murine checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) drastically improved survival than checkpoint blockade alone. Strikingly, surviving mice resisted tumor rechallenge, indicating the establishment of durable antitumor memory. Collectively, these findings establish rVMG-H-2Kk as a novel immunotherapeutic platform capable of converting immune-cold tumors into immune-hot, sensitizing tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and establishing durable antitumor immunity in PDAC.">

        <tr id="Background Relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) remains a major clinical challenge, as most patients eventually relapse following standard treatments and are left with limited therapeutic options. Although b-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR-T cell therapy has recently shown remarkable efficacy in select patients, broader implementation is hindered by its reliance on autologous cells, prolonged manufacturing timelines, high costs, and severe immune-related toxicities. These challenges have prompted an urgent demand for safer, more accessible, and rapidly applicable immunotherapeutic alternatives. Methods CBMC (cord blood mononuclear cells) were cultured with irradiated BMMC (bone marrow mononuclear cells) from RRMM patients in the presence of defined cytokines, aiming to develop a new therapeutic immune cell product for RRMM. Their phenotypic and functional characteristics, including non-MHC-restricted and MHC-restricted cytotoxicity mechanisms, were analyzed using surface marker profiling, cytokine secretion assays, in vitro cytotoxicity assays, functional and blocking assays. Antitumor activity was evaluated in xenograft mouse models using MM.1 S and RPMI-8226 cells. Results We successfully generated CD8+ NKT-like cells through tumor priming, which exhibited potent cytotoxicity and elevated cytokine production against multiple myeloma cell lines and primary RRMM samples. Mechanistically, tumor-priming CD8+ NKT-like cells (TPNC) cytotoxicity was mediated by both non-MHC–restricted pathways involving LFA-1 and DNAM-1, and MHC-restricted, TCR-mediated recognition. TPNC efficiently formed immune synapses, rapidly polarized cytotoxic granules, and engaged in serial killing. In xenograft models, TPNC significantly suppressed tumor progression, prolonged survival, and persisted in circulation without observable toxicity. Based on these findings, we extended the tumor-priming strategy to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), successfully generating TPNC with robust cytotoxic activity. In ALL samples, TPNC exhibited cytotoxicity comparable to anti-CD19 CAR-NK cells. Conclusions TPNC represents a novel cytotoxic lymphocyte product generated through tumor-driven priming. Their dual recognition capacity, functional versatility, and favorable safety profile highlight their potential as a scalable and personalized immunotherapy platform for hematologic malignancies.

        <tr id="Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), traditionally characterized in innate immune cells, are emerging as critical modulators of T cell function. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), STING, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and natural killer receptors (NKRs) are expressed by CD8+ T cells, where they influence various cellular responses. Primarily serving as noncanonical costimulatory signals, TLRs can modulate T cell activation, differentiation, metabolic fitness, and memory formation. RLRs and STING can promote T cell expansion and cytokine production. Both activating and inhibitory NKRs can also alter T cell cytotoxicity and differentiation. As demonstrated in recent advancements, the capacity of these signaling cascades to enhance T cell responses offers promising therapeutic opportunities in cancer. Clinical strategies are being developed to selectively harness each of these pathways, such as TLR and STING agonists to bolster antitumor responses, and NKR-based approaches to amplify cytotoxic function. Additionally, adoptive T cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, are incorporating these innate signaling components to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression, enhance functional longevity, and improve therapeutic efficacy.

        <tr id="Disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) is a rare but serious systemic fungal infection that can trigger secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a hyperinflammatory syndrome with high mortality. However, the immunopathogenesis of DH-associated HLH remains poorly defined due to the lack of high-resolution immune profiling data. The dynamics of immunological and metabolic analysis was performed in a 14-year-old female patient with DH-HLH using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and multiplex cytokine profiling. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were collected at three timepoints: before antifungal treatment, and at 1, and 2 weeks post-treatment, respectively. Immune subsets, functional markers, and cytokine/chemokine levels were evaluated. Mass cytometry identified 13 distinct immune cell subsets, including NK cells, double-negative T (DNT) cells, memory CD8+ T cells, and M2 macrophages. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated a progressive decline in proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IP-10) accompanied by an expansion of reparative subsets, particularly M2 macrophages. Concurrent immune-metabolic profiling revealed a metabolic shift from glycolysis to lipid oxidation, characterized by decreased expression of GLUT1 and CPT1A and increased expression of CD36. This transition from a glycolysis-driven inflammatory state to an oxidative, immunoregulatory phenotype correlated with clinical recovery and attenuation of the cytokine storm. This case demonstrates the utility of mass cytometry for dynamic immune monitoring in infection-triggered HLH. The findings highlight metabolic reprogramming and immune restoration as key features of disease resolution and suggest potential immunometabolic targets for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases (ADs) arise from the breakdown of self-tolerance, leading to pathogenic immune responses against healthy tissues. The PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint is pivotal for maintaining peripheral tolerance by suppressing autoreactive T cells, and its dysfunction drives the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), and other ADs. Conventional approaches—including monoclonal antibodies, soluble PD-L1 fusion proteins, small-molecule or RNA regulators, and cell- or gene-based therapies—have shown promise. However, their broader application is constrained by systemic immunosuppression, off-target effects, infection and malignancy risks, and manufacturing complexities. Nanomedicine offers transformative solutions by leveraging polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes or lipid nanoparticles, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and biomimetic cell-membrane coatings to deliver PD-1/PD-L1 agonists with high spatial and temporal precision. These nanocarrier platforms enable localized checkpoint activation, co-delivery of tolerogenic agents, and improved biodistribution with reduced systemic toxicity. Here, we systematically review the structural and signaling features of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, outlines the limitations of conventional therapeutic modalities, and highlights how nanocarrier-based approaches overcome these barriers to restore immune homeostasis in ADs. By integrating mechanistic insights with advanced delivery technologies, this review outlines a roadmap for next-generation, precision-engineered interventions aimed at reestablishing immune tolerance and improving clinical outcomes in ADs.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors a highly inflammatory microenvironment driven predominantly by activated innate immune cells, despite being classified as an immunologically cold tumor due to limited T cell infiltration. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key contributors to disease progression, in part through their production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a pro-inflammatory cytokine with tumor-promoting functions. However, the precise role of IL-1β⁺ TAMs in GBM remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the functional contributions of IL-1β⁺ TAMs to GBM malignancy and to explore their therapeutic relevance. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed that IL-1β⁺ TAMs were enriched in GBM tissues compared to normal brain tissue, with their elevated infiltration correlating with aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis. Functionally, IL-1β stimulated GBM cells to secrete inflammatory mediators such as PGE2 and TNFα. These mediators, in turn, upregulated C/EBPβ expression in macrophages, thereby enhancing IL-1β transcription. Mechanistically, tumor-derived PGE2 and TNFα synergistically activated C/EBPβ via EP4 receptor signaling, initiating a self-sustaining IL-1β-PGE2/TNFα-EP4-C/EBPβ-IL-1β feedback loop that amplified pro-inflammatory crosstalk between GBM cells and TAMs. Disruption of PGE2/EP4 signaling effectively suppressed IL-1β+ TAM generation and attenuated tumor growth in preclinical models. Our finding highlights how GBM cells induce macrophages to secrete IL-1β through the synergistic action of PGE2 and TNFα via the EP4 receptor and C/EBPβ activation. This feedback loop between tumor cells and macrophages fosters a pro-inflammatory TME that drives GBM progression. Targeting the PGE2/EP4-C/EBPβ signaling axis may therefore present a promising immunotherapeutic strategy to disrupt tumor-TAM crosstalk and suppress GBM progression.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major global health challenge and current therapies are not always effective. In addition, certain immune cell populations, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), pose a significant barrier to immune-based treatments. Some phytochemicals, particularly compounds derived from Allium spp. like Propyl-Propane Thiosulfonate (PTSO), have shown strong immunomodulatory potential in digestive disorders. This study aims to investigate the capacity of PTSO to modulate immune responses and affect tumor progression in CRC models, in vitro and in vivo, with a focus on the immune cell populations that comprise the tumor microenvironment. Methods: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were incubated with PTSO (25 μM for 48 h) and characterized by flow cytometry. These cells (1 × 106) were then injected into NOD scid gamma (NSG) immunodeficient mice, which were simultaneously induced to develop a subcutaneous tumor by injection of HCT116 enriched cancer stem cells (CSCs) colonospheres (60,000 cells/mouse). Results: PTSO reduced MDSC populations, specifically, it significantly reduced monocytic (M-MDSCs, Control: 7.27 ± 0.53% vs. PTSO: 4.70 ± 2.39%; p = 0.0458) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-MDSCs, Control: 5.28 ± 0.99% vs. PTSO: 3.41 ± 1.58%; p = 0.0385) MDSCs. In parallel, PTSO increased T cell subpopulations, particularly interferon gamma (IFNG)-producing cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Control: 9.52 ± 2.06% vs. PTSO: 15.04 ± 5.01%; p = 0.0685). In the humanized tumor xenograft mouse, the administration of PTSO-pretreated hPBMCs led to a significant reduction in tumor size (Control: 1.43 ± 0.82 cm3 vs. PTSO: 0.44 ± 0.35 cm3; p = 0.0068), accompanied by increased infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes and Natural Killer (NK) cells and downregulation of immunosuppressive genes. These effects resulted in a reduction in cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. Conclusions: The dual effect of PTSO on immune cell populations, reducing immunosuppressive myeloid cells and enhancing effector T lymphocyte and NK cell responses, resulted in an anti-tumor effect, highlighting this bioactive compound as a promising adjuvant in CRC immunotherapy and opening avenues for future research combining immunotherapy with PTSO in alternative models to optimize dosing and enhance translational potential.">

        <tr id="Abstract Senescent immune cells secrete varied inflammatory factors that weaken the systemic anti-tumor ability and promote the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. Tumor cells could also accelerate the immune cellular senescence through diverse mechanisms. However, there has been a lack of indicators to quantify the senescence levels of different immune cell types. A model for Identifying Senescent Immune Cells and Samples was developed to explore the role of senescent immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). By integrating bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data, we constructed immune cell gene expression profiles for 23 cancer types using a deconvolution algorithm. By calculating the cellular senescence scores, we found that tumor samples exhibited higher senescence levels than normal samples. Monocytes/macrophages were prone to co-senescence with other cell subtypes. Differentially expressed genes in the high- and low-immune cellular senescence scores groups were enriched in the senescence pathway. Patients with higher levels of immunosenescence were associated with better prognosis. At the single-cell level, the number and strength of cell-to-cell interactions increased following immune cellular senescence in most cancers. Samples with senescent immune cells exhibited poorer immunotherapy response. Our study advances our understanding of senescent immune cells in the TIME, provides insights into cancer-specific relationships between immune cellular senescence and immune characteristics, and offers a model for identifying these senescent immune cells.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer represents a typically immune “cold” tumor, where obvious immunosuppression, spatial T-cell exclusion, and cellular dysfunction collectively limit immunotherapy effectiveness. Especially in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the immune low-response state is driven by complex interactions among tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), suppressive stromal networks, and the T-cell compartment (regulatory T cells, Tregs, and exhausted effector T cells). Emerging multi-omics technologies—particularly single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics—have showed the heterogeneity and spatial immune organization underlying this suppressed state. Here, we integrate these datasets to describe TAM phenotypes and spatial niches, T-cell exhaustion, Tregs accumulation, NK-cell dysfunction, and stromal barriers that enforce exclusion. We then derive phenotype-guided combination strategies to remodel the tumor microenvironment and improve responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. This synthesis provides a concise, multi-dimensional framework for precision immunotherapy and for overcoming resistance in immune-low ovarian cancers.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening complications that can arise following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). GVHD occurs when immune cells—primarily T cells—from the graft recognize host cells as foreign entities and initiate an immune response against host tissues. This immune reaction generally involves a diverse array of cytokines, including interleukins (ILs), which play a pivotal role in modulating the immune response, promoting inflammation, and sustaining immune tolerance. Members of the interleukin family are not only directly involved in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells but also regulate inflammatory responses and the migration of immune cells. Consequently, they significantly influence both the clinical manifestations and prognosis of GVHD. The objective of this study is to review recent advancements in research concerning interleukins and their role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. This study aims to elucidate how interleukins contribute to immune regulation, inflammatory responses, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, we will discuss their potential as therapeutic targets, with the intention of providing novel insights and strategies for the clinical management of GVHD.">

However, the influence of distinct tissue environments on the differentiation and clonal selection of polyclonal T cells remains unclear, primarily because of the technical challenges in tracking these cells in vivo. To address this question, we generated Tracking Recently Activated Cell Kinetics (TRACK) mice, a dual-recombinase fate-mapping system that enables precise spatial and temporal labeling of recently activated CD4+ T cells. Using TRACK mice during influenza infection, we observed organ-specific clonal selection and transcriptional differentiation in the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes (medLNs), and spleen. T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing revealed that local antigenic landscapes and clonal identity shape repertoire diversity, resulting in a low clonal overlap between tissues during acute infection. During the effector phase, spleen-derived CD4+ T cells preferentially adopted a stem-like migratory phenotype, whereas those activated in the medLNs predominantly differentiated into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Memory formation was associated with increased clonal overlap between lung and medLN-derived cells, whereas splenic clones retained a distinct repertoire. Additionally, memory CD4+ T cells displayed converging antigen specificity across tissues over time. These results highlight the tissue-dependent mechanisms driving clonal selection and functional specialization during infection and underscore how memory development facilitates clonal redistribution and functional convergence.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), comprising up to 50% of the tumor mass, are recruited via chemokine axes such as CCL2/CCR2, CX3CL1/CX3CR1, and CXCL12/CXCR4 and adopt an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype, facilitating immune escape and angiogenesis. Key signaling pathways, including CSF1R, STAT3, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, and HIF-1α, regulate TAM function, making them promising therapeutic targets. Strategies such as TAM depletion, reprogramming, and immune checkpoint blockade (PD-1/PD-L1, and CD47-SIRPα) have shown potential in preclinical models. Emerging approaches, including CAR-macrophage (CAR-M) therapy, nanotechnology-based drug delivery, and exosome-mediated modulation, offer new avenues for intervention. However, clinical translation remains challenging due to GBM’s heterogeneity and adaptive resistance mechanisms. Future research should integrate multi-omics profiling and AI-driven drug discovery to refine TAM-targeted therapies and improve patient outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of TAM-mediated immune regulation in GBM and explores evolving therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming its treatment barriers.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.">

        <tr id="Objectives Preclinical models that accurately recapitulate the human immune response, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME), are needed for the translational and predictive testing of new therapies. Here, we examine whether the genO-BRGSF-HIS model—characterized by robust reconstitution of both human lymphoid and myeloid cells following engraftment with CD34+ cord blood cells—could be a translatable mouse model for human tumor biology and a relevant platform for evaluating novel immunotherapies. Methods genO-BRGSF mice were reconstituted with human CD34+ cord blood cells (genO-BRGSF-HIS) and treated with exogenous human Flt3 ligand (hFlt3L). Myeloid and dendritic cell functionality was analyzed following treatment with different compounds (TLR agonists, TREM1 agonist, STING agonist, or T-cell engagers) and following the implantation of different tumor cell lines (MDA-MB-231, A549, HPAF-II). Results We show that myeloid, dendritic and lymphoid cells (including NK and γδ T cells) are functional and recruited into the TME in genO-BRGSF-HIS mice implanted with different tumor cell lines, and that different immune cell populations are activated and get polarized within the TME. The composition of the TME is dependent on tumor type and tumor burden, demonstrating plasticity in the crosstalk between the human immune system and the tumor cells. Furthermore, we observed polarization of the cells recruited to the TME, as well as a wide diversity of recruited cell populations, suggesting that this model reproduces human physiopathology in the context of cancer. Based on the recruitment of the different cell populations according to tumor type, we also demonstrate that this model can be used for testing new therapies targeting lymphoid cells, such as T-cell engagers. Conclusions genO-BRGSF-HIS mice do not exhibit adverse effects associated with the development of human lymphoid and myeloid cells following CD34+ cord blood cell reconstitution, and their extended lifespan allows for longer experimental study windows. Overall, we show that this model develops functional myeloid and lymphoid cells which are recruited to the TME, making it a valuable tool for testing new immunotherapies that modulate the interaction between the tumor and the immune system.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It follows a dynamic course in which early hyperinflammation coexists and overlaps with progressive immune suppression, a process best described as immunodynamic disruption. Key mechanisms include extensive lymphocyte death, expansion of regulatory T cells, impaired antigen presentation, and persistent activation of inhibitory checkpoints such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). These changes reduce immune competence and increase vulnerability to secondary infections. Clinically, reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen–DR (HLA-DR) on monocytes and persistent lymphopenia have emerged as robust biomarkers for patient stratification and timing of immunomodulatory therapies. Beyond the acute phase, many survivors do not achieve full immune recovery but instead develop a Persistent Immune Remnant, defined as long-lasting immune, metabolic, and endothelial dysfunction despite apparent clinical resolution. Recognizing PIR emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring and biomarker-guided interventions to restore immune balance. To integrate these observations, we propose the SIMMP–Sepsis model (Sepsis-Associated Persistent Multiorgan Immunometabolic Syndrome), which links molecular dysfunction to clinical trajectories and provides a framework for developing precision immunotherapies. This perspective reframes sepsis not only as an acute crisis but also as a chronic immunometabolic syndrome, where survival marks the beginning of active immune restoration.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) proliferation is significantly influenced by the interactions between leukemia blasts and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Specifically, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) derived from AML patients (AML-MSCs) are known to support leukemia growth and facilitate disease progression. Studies have demonstrated that the transfer of mitochondria from MSCs to AML blasts not only aids in disease progression but also contributes to chemotherapy resistance. Furthermore, BM stromal cells can trigger a metabolic shift in malignant cells from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, which enhances both growth and chemo-resistance. This study focuses on identifying transcriptional and metabolic alterations in AML-MSCs to uncover potential targeted therapies for AML. We employed RNA sequencing and microarray analysis on MSCs cocultured with leukemic cells (MLL-AF9) and on MSCs isolated from both non-leukemic and MLL-AF9 leukemic mice. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated a significant downregulation of gene sets associated with oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in AML-MSCs. Furthermore, coculture of MSCs from wild-type mice (WT-MSCs) and a healthy donor individual (HD-MSCs) with AML cells demonstrated reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. These metabolic changes were consistent in AML-MSCs derived from both leukemic mice and patients. Our results indicate that AML cells diminish the metabolic capacity of MSCs, specifically targeting oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. These findings suggest potential metabolic vulnerabilities that could be exploited to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for AML.">

        <tr id="The clinical effectiveness of immunotherapies for lung cancers has been greatly hindered by the immune-excluded and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and limited pulmonary accessibility of therapeutics. Here, we develop an inhalable lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system that enables simultaneous delivery of mRNA encoding anti-discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) single-chain variable fragments (mscFv) and siRNA targeting PD-L1 (siPD-L1) into pulmonary cancer cells. The secreted anti-DDR1 scFv blocks the binding of DDR1 extracellular domain to collagen, disrupting collagen fiber alignment and reducing tumor stiffness, thereby facilitating T cell infiltration. Meanwhile, PD-L1 silencing alleviates immunosuppression and preserves T cell cytotoxicity. In vivo results demonstrate that mscFv@LNP induces collagen fiber rearrangement and diminishes tumor stiffness. In both orthotopic and metastatic mouse models of lung cancer, inhalation of mscFv/siPD-L1@LNP promotes tumor regression and extends overall survival. This strategy could be broadly applicable to solid tumors and benefit other cancer immunotherapies by addressing the universally hostile TME involved in tumor progression.">

Key mechanisms involve KC-mediated fibronectin deposition, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and MDSC-driven T-cell exhaustion. Clinically, therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) such as CSF1R inhibition, CCR2/CCR5 blockade, and CD40 agonism show promise in preclinical and early-phase trials, especially when combined with immunotherapy. However, challenges remain in overcoming systemic immunosuppression. This review summarizes the dual roles of hepatic immune cells including Kupffer cells (KCs), neutrophils, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in either suppressing or promoting metastatic colonization. We elucidate how the liver’s immunological balance, governed by innate and adaptive responses, shifts toward immunosuppression during metastasis, fostering a pro-tumor niche. This synthesis of immunological insights underscores the potential of TME-modulating therapies to improve outcomes in MLC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are organized aggregates of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and stromal cells that form at sites of inflammation, providing adaptive immune responses outside of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). Found in various pathological conditions—including chronic infections, cancer, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and allergy—the presence of TLSs is linked to potentiation of local immunity. TLSs can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on context, and have been implicated as prognostic for disease severity and therapy response. Architecturally, TLSs resemble SLOs with distinct T and B cell areas supported by fibroblasts that secrete chemokines and cytokines that support immune cells. These structures must be created de novo in non‐lymphoid tissues; thus, the steps for TLS formation mimic, but do not completely copy, those of SLO formation. The accumulation of immune cells in tissues in inflammatory settings can initiate remodeling of tissue fibroblasts, leading to TLS formation; this process is common across tissues, although there are tissue‐ and disease‐specific pathways that impact TLS formation in certain contexts. This review will explore the immune‐stromal crosstalk in kidney, lung, and skin TLSs across a range of disease settings, highlighting shared as well as tissue‐specific mechanisms for TLS formation.">

 Radiation therapy (RT) can trigger type I interferon (IFN-I) responses and anti-tumor immunity in various can- cers. However, glioblastoma inevitably recurs, suggesting RT does not generate a long-lasting immune response. This may be due to a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and/or RT-induced immune evasion. Our ﬁndings show that RT promotes fatty acid synthase (FASN)-mediated lipid synthesis, a metabolic program that reportedly suppresses IFN-I in viral immunity. We hypothesized that FASN induction similarly inhibits IFN-I in irradiated glioblastoma, limiting antitumor immunity. We aim to determine whether FASN blockade restores IFN-I signaling, enhances immune inﬁltration, and improves RT and immunotherapy eﬃcacy.



 Murine glioblastoma cells were subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FASN knockout or treated with FASN in- hibitors (FASNi), then irradiated (6Gy) and analyzed 24h post-RT using RNA sequencing, LEGENDplex, and ELISA. In vivo, glioblastoma-bearing mice received FASNi (days 9-30), anti-PD-1 (twice weekly, days 15-24), and fractionated RT (5×6Gy, days 10-14). Survival was monitored (n=7/group), and tumor immune inﬁltration was assessed at day 20 using ﬂow cytometry and multiplex imaging. Long-term survivors (>100 days) were rechal- lenged in the contralateral hemisphere. In some experiments, mice received anti-CD8 or anti-IFNAR antibodies.



 Transcriptome analysis identiﬁed IFN-I signaling as the most enriched pathway in irradiated FASN-knockout cells, conﬁrmed by increased IFN-I protein levels. In vivo, RT+FASNi inﬂamed glioblastoma tumors, enhancing CD11c and CD8 T-cell inﬁltration. Remarkably, adding anti-PD-1 to RT+FASNi further improved survival, with 86% of mice tumor-free at 100 days vs. 43% in other RT-treated groups. Rechallenged RT+FASNi+anti-PD-1 survivors did not develop a tumor when compared to naïve animals, demonstrating immunological memory. CD8 depletion or IFNAR blockade abrogated this effect, highlighting the critical role of IFN-I and CD8



 FASN inhibition restores IFN-I responses in irradiated glioblastoma, enhancing immune inﬁltration and im- munotherapy eﬃcacy. These ﬁndings highlight FASN as a key target to shift glioblastoma from immunosup- pressive to immunoresponsive.

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic active white matter lesions, identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1)-like and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite chronic B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. CSF:serum protein ratios revealed compartmentalized myeloid activation in cases with PRL. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.">

In this review, we summarize the evidence that innate immune memory is epigenetically encoded in HSPCs, and we consider whether HSPC subpopulations with differentiation bias, cell autonomous epigenetic reprogramming, or both features underlie the phenomenon of central trained immunity.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) have demonstrated promising results in patients with solid tumors, yet the immunological mechanisms influencing their efficacy require further investigation. T cell exhaustion, induced by prolonged antigen exposure, is known to compromise T cell-based immunotherapies, but its effect on TCB efficacy remains unclear. Herein, we assessed the TCB efficacy on tumor-specific T cells, emphasizing their functional status. Utilizing an immunocompetent mouse model with melanoma expressing an immunogenic antigen, we showed that tumor-specific T cells acquire an exhausted phenotype and fail to expand under TCB treatment. Both mouse and human tumor-specific T cells in vitro demonstrated that chronically stimulated T cells exhibit a reduced response to TCBs. The comparison of TCB efficacy in T cell-inflamed versus non-inflamed tumors in mice revealed TCB success depends more on T cell functional fitness than their initial abundance. These data underscore the importance of T cell exhaustion, suggesting that exhausted tumor-specific T cells are unlikely to be the primary effectors redirected by TCBs for tumor eradication. Our study highlights the need to maintain T cell fitness and prevent exhaustion to enhance TCB therapy outcomes, which may help identify patients who could benefit most from TCB treatments in clinics.">

Characterized by their immunosuppressive capabilities and reliance on the transcription factor Foxp3 (Forkhead box protein P3), Tregs employ multiple mechanisms, including cytokine secretion, metabolic control, and cell contact inhibition, to restrain excessive immune activation to prevent autoimmunity while maintaining tissue repair processes. However, dysregulation in their frequency or function—whether deficiency or hyperactivity—is implicated in diverse pathologies, spanning autoimmune disorders, cancer progression, transplant rejection, and emerging associations with neurological and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, Treg-targeted strategies represent a promising approach for restoring immune balance under various conditions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on Treg biology, from their discovery and definition of markers to their new regulatory mechanisms. We further explore the roles of Tregs across diseases, emphasizing their context-dependent therapeutic potential. Strategies to deplete or inhibit Tregs in cancer immunotherapy contrast with approaches to expand or stabilize their function in autoimmunity and transplantation. However, challenges persist, including achieving tissue-specific targeting, ensuring the functional stability of engineered Tregs, and minimizing off-target effects.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Disialoganglioside (GD2) is a tumor-associated antigen that is highly expressed in various neuroectodermal cancers, including melanoma. While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy has demonstrated remarkable success in treating hematologic neoplasms, the identification of suitable targets remains a major obstacle in translating this approach to solid tumors.


METHODS
Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from six healthy donors were used to generate GD2-specific CAR T cells via retroviral transduction. The resulting GD2.CAR T cells were characterized by NanoString transcriptome profiling, flow cytometry with hierarchical stochastic neighbor embedding (HSNE) dimensionality reduction, and in vitro cytotoxicity assays against GD2+ and GD2- melanoma cell lines. In vivo experiments were also performed using GD2+ xenograft models and a single intratumoral dose of 8 × 106 GD2.CAR T cells.


RESULT
The GD2.CAR T cell population exhibited a predominantly naive phenotype (CD8+CD40L+CD69‒CD107a+4-1BB+FasL+) and effective anti-tumor mechanisms involving the granzyme A/B axis, the Fas/FasL axis, and cytokine release. Transcriptome analysis revealed transduction-related effects on proliferation and a shift towards an effector phenotype during early co-culture with tumor cells, accompanied by upregulation of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and cytokine signaling genes. GD2.CAR T cells demonstrated robust cytotoxicity against GD2+ melanoma cells in vitro, while significant in vivo tumor control was observed in xenograft models.


CONCLUSION
GD2.CAR T cells demonstrate potent anti-tumor activity against melanoma in vitro and in vivo, highlighting their therapeutic potential and warranting further clinical investigation.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME), comprising malignant and non-transformed cells like immune cells, endothelial cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts, significantly affects tumor growth and progression. Tumor cells manipulate the TME by releasing chemokines and inhibitory cytokines, reprogramming surrounding cells to support their survival and evade immune detection. Innate immune cells within the TME play dual roles, either promoting or inhibiting tumor progression, impacting immunotherapy outcomes. Recent studies highlight the influence of innate immune cells in shaping the TME and the pivotal role of tumor-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating these cells. miRNAs regulate gene expression and enhance tumor immune evasion, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and invasion. Their tumor-specific expression patterns suggest potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This study focuses on how miRNAs affect innate immune cells like macrophages, dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and natural killer cells, contributing to immunosuppressive or immunogenic environments. Understanding miRNA-mediated interactions between cancer and immune cells opens new possibilities for improving targeted immunotherapy and advancing cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Significance Mice are essential for studying immune responses, but functional differences between human and murine systems limit their utility, particularly for neutrophils. Humanized mice with a human immune system have advanced understanding of human immunity, yet suboptimal myelopoiesis and lack of functional neutrophils remain challenges. We developed MaGIC mice, a model expressing human CD47, M-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and thrombopoietin while reducing murine CD47 on the C57Bl/6 N background. MaGIC mice support robust human hematopoiesis, including functional neutrophils, monocytes, and tissue macrophages. These neutrophils, phenotypically and developmentally comparable to human neutrophils, exhibit chemotaxis, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation in response to inflammatory stimuli, providing an innovative platform to study human neutrophils in infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-MPNs) are clonal hematologic malignancies characterized not only by driver mutations such as JAK2V617F, CALR, and MPL but also by a profoundly dysregulated immune microenvironment. Chronic inflammation and immune remodeling sustain malignant hematopoiesis and contribute to disease progression from essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) to overt myelofibrosis (MF). Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines—including IL-2, IFN-α, IL-23, and TNF-α—drive abnormal T cell polarization, favoring a pathogenic Th17 phenotype. Lymphocyte subset analysis reveals a predominance of exhausted PD-1+ T cells, reflecting impaired immune surveillance. Concurrently, alterations in neutrophil apoptosis lead to persistent inflammation and stromal activation. GRO-α (CXCL1) is elevated in ET but reduced in MF, suggesting a subtype-specific role in disease biology. Fibrosis-promoting factors such as TGF-β and IL-13 mediate bone marrow remodeling and megakaryocyte expansion, while VEGF and other angiogenic factors enhance vascular niche alterations, particularly in PV. These immunopathologic features underscore novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. In addition to JAK inhibition, targeted strategies such as CXCR1/2 antagonists, anti-TGF-β agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 blockade) may offer disease-modifying potential. Understanding the interplay between cytokine signaling and immune cell dysfunction is crucial for developing precision immunotherapies in MPNs.">

However, the unique and/or conserved features that enable B cell development at this site remain unclear. To investigate the molecular and cellular scaffolds for B cell lymphopoiesis in mouse and human fetal intestines, we leveraged single-cell RNA-Seq, in situ immunofluorescence, spatial transcriptomics, and high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry. We found that SI mesenchymal and stromal cells expressed higher levels of chemokines known to recruit common lymphoid progenitors. Importantly, local lymphatic endothelial cells expressed IL-7 and TSLP in proximity to IL-7R+ precursor B cells, likely promoting their differentiation in the SI. Notably, we found that fetal-derived lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells were required for B cell development and localization in the SI, but not fetal liver. These findings identify a lymphoid tissue development–independent role for this immune cell in B cell development. Collectively, our data reveal a conserved intestinal B cell niche in mice and humans, challenging traditional models of lymphopoiesis. The identification of a requisite cellular/molecular scaffold for fetal B cell development allows future studies to test the importance of this de novo B cell lymphopoiesis to long-term immunity.">

        <tr id="Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with chronic liver inflammation being a major risk factor. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have been associated with improved survival and better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in several cancers. However, their role in HCC remains unclear, and findings are often contradictory. Methods: The study investigated the presence and composition of TLSs across multiple liver disease models, including livers containing HCC. TLSs were characterized to identify the essential cellular components for functional lymphoid activity. The functional role of age-associated B cells (ABCs) was further explored by blocking T-bet expression in B cells, thereby preventing their differentiation into ABCs. Results: TLS frequency was increased in livers containing HCC. Characterization confirmed the presence of key immune cell subsets supporting lymphoid function. Blocking T-bet in B cells led to a reduction in ABCs, which resulted in smaller TLS, a specific decrease in hepatic B cells, and reduced tumor lesion size in HCC-bearing mice. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ABCs promote TLS formation and growth, facilitating B-cell recruitment to the liver and supporting HCC progression. Targeting T-bet–dependent ABC differentiation may represent a novel strategy to limit TLS formation and slow HCC progression.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family includes natural killer (NK) cells, recognised for over 50 years, as well as several more recently identified populations. Over the past 15 years, ILCs have emerged as key orchestrators of tissue homeostasis and inflammation. To build upon the early promise of cancer immunotherapies, it is essential to better understand the pathways regulating the composition of, and immunosuppressive mechanisms that dominate many solid cancers and effectively curtail or block T cell responses. Given their residence within most tissues, how these cellular sentinels influence tumour development and progression remains an active area of both discovery and more translationally focused research. By defining precisely how different immunosuppressive pathways form, rationalised immunotherapy combinations can be devised to specifically target these. Current evidence indicates that for each ILC subset, both pro‐ and anti‐tumourigenic roles are possible, likely reflecting local cues within different tissues and contexts. Here, we seek to concisely review some of the prevailing data describing ILC contributions to tumour immunity and highlight some of the challenges that still exist in fully dissecting these mechanisms.">

        <tr id="T cell-based therapies, involving ex vivo expansion of patients’ T lymphocytes, hold significant promise for chemotherapy resistant cases of breast cancer (BC), although their effectiveness remains challenging. Building on our previous findings that the expression of the antigen presenting molecule, HLA-DR, is crucial on tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for a favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we further investigated the role of HLA-DR-expressing CTLs in anti-tumor responses and evaluated strategies to amplify these cells. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that HLA-DR expression on CTLs is important for effective tumor cell elimination. Notably, blocking HLA-DR or depleting CD4+ T cells impaired CTLs activation, suggesting a critical role for antigen presentation by CTLs to CD4+ T cells through HLA-DR in promoting robust anti-tumor responses. Based on these findings we optimized an ex vivo stimulation protocol that increases the proportion of HLA-DR+CTLs with improved cytotoxicity, prioritizing cell quality over yield. Moreover, we showed that adding anti-PD-1 to the stimulation, further upregulated HLA-DR expression, and intensified CTLs’ cytotoxic ability. This aligns with our in silico analysis suggesting a potential regulatory link between PD-1 and HLA-DR via non-coding RNAs. Overall, our findings open new avenues for advancing T cell-based therapies and improve the outcomes of chemotherapy-resistant-BC.">

Functional assays demonstrated that CD2 knockdown inhibited cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity, leading to impaired tumor cell recognition and enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo studies showed that CD2‐deficient CTLs promoted tumor growth and brain metastasis while affecting metabolic reprogramming by altering key enzyme expressions in pyrimidine biosynthesis and arginine metabolism pathways.

        <tr id="Background Circulating lymphocytes are essential for the immune response to helminth infections, as they secrete cytokines and thus coordinate subsequent immunological processes. In canine angiostrongylosis, a potentially fatal disease caused by the metastrongylid nematode Angiostrongylus vasorum, the underlying immune mechanisms driving disease progression remain poorly understood despite the severe clinical consequences. Canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy dogs and stimulated with three different antigens of A vasorum, including adult excretory-secretory products (ESP), adult full-worm somatic antigen, and first-stage larval (L1) somatic antigen. Temporal dynamics and magnitude of relative cytokine expression (IFNγ, TNF, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13) was evaluated after 4 h, 24 h, and 5 days of antigen exposure via quantitative reverse transcription PCR. To determine whether the cytokine expression changes translated into shifts in circulating mononuclear cell subsets or proliferative activity, phenotypic characterisation by flow cytometry was conducted after a 72 h stimulation with L1 antigen or ESP, and compared to unstimulated controls. Results Early responses varied across antigen types, with ESP promoting a regulatory cytokine profile with modest upregulation of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, and downregulation of IFNγ, TNF, and IL-13. Adult antigen induced increased expression of all examined cytokines, while L1 antigen triggered the strongest inflammatory response compared to the other antigens. At 24 h, all responses were amplified, particularly those to L1 and adult antigen, and showed a shift towards a Th2 cytokine profile with increased IL-4 and IL-13 expression. By five days, IL-4 and IL-13 remained predominant. No change in the relative abundance of major immune cell populations (CD4⁺ T cells, CD8⁺ T cells, B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and CD14⁻ CD22⁻ antigen-presenting cells) was observed in flow cytometry following stimulation. However, a notable increase in Ki67 expression, a marker of cell proliferation, was detected in CD8⁺ T cells after L1 antigen stimulation. Conclusions Distinct cytokine profiles elicited by different A. vasorum antigens suggest that the parasite’s modulation of host immunity and induction of stage-specific responses are key to persistence and clinical presentation of canine angiostrongylosis. Further investigation into the antigenic components and immune pathways may lead to tailored therapies, improved clinical management, and to a deeper understanding of stage-specific aspects of helminth infections.">

These cells employ unique antigen recognition mechanisms to trigger rapid immune responses. γδ T cells facilitate early pathogen elimination and immune regulation, whereas MAIT cells detect microbial metabolites and modulate the systemic inflammation. NKT cells balance immune homeostasis through dual pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production.

Elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying sepsis could advance therapies that restore immune equilibrium and potentially improve clinical outcomes.

 Adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies have shown limited efficacy against most solid tumors. A key barrier to success is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Beyond local effects, tumors induce systemic immune disturbances that further hinder anti-tumor immunity and promote disease progression. In this study, we investigate how tumor-driven systemic immunosuppression compromises the function of both endogenous and adoptively transferred natural killer (NK) cells, identifying potential strategies to enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes.



 We utilized syngeneic murine cancer models to systematically characterize alterations in immune cell populations within the circulation and spleen. Comprehensive and in-depth assessment of immune cell function, transcriptional activity, and metabolic state was performed using flow cytometry, Seahorse metabolic analysis, RNA sequencing, metabolic tracing, and ex vivo co-culture systems.



 In our PDAC mouse models, tumor burden elicited a robust systemic inflammatory response marked by expansion of myeloid lineage cells, particularly MDSCs, within the TME, peripheral blood, and spleen. Tumor growth led to reduced frequencies and functional deficits in both endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells in circulation and spleen. Depletion of Gr-1+ MDSCs effectively restored NK cell effector functions. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice promote NK cell dysfunction through induction of lipid peroxidation. Notably, we observed pronounced upregulation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)—a central lipid metabolism regulator—in MDSCs, which drove increased lipid oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Disruption of the ApoE-LDL receptor (LDLR) axis in MDSCs, achieved via genetic ablation, reprogrammed their metabolic activities and significantly reduced their immunosuppressive capacity toward both endogenous and transferred NK cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of lipid utilization rescued NK cell function and, when combined with NK cell adoptive transfer, produced synergistic anti-tumor effects in PDAC models.



 Our results emphasize the pivotal role of MDSC expansion in mediating systemic immunosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts. We identify the ApoE/LDLR axis as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt MDSC-driven immunosuppression, thereby enhancing the efficacy of NK cell–based immunotherapies. These findings underscore the importance of resolving systemic immune dysregulation in cancer patients to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Solid tumors often suppress antitumor immune responses by promoting various dysfunctional CD8+ T cell states, which limit the effectiveness of T-cell-based immunotherapy. However, the mechanisms that promote these states have not been fully characterized. It is demonstrated that spontaneous priming responses during tumor growth can produce memory T cell reservoirs that are conducive to poor proliferative responsiveness during boosting vaccination. Surprisingly, when type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is impeded, boosting vaccination can elicit robust proliferative responses from tumor-primed memory T cells and promote tumor control. This is observed in multiple tumor types and target antigens. In contrast to conventional memory T cells, tumor-primed memory T cells are unique in their pre-encoded responsiveness to IFN-I and show enrichment of pathways pertaining to DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Tumor-primed memory T cells up-regulate p21 expression and blockade of either p21 or IFN-I can alleviate this effect to improve their proliferative capacity during boosting vaccination. Characterization of tumor-primed memory T cells revealed transcriptional and phenotypic features of cellular senescence, where higher senescence severity correlated with higher responsiveness to IFNα/β receptor blockade. Overall, IFN-I hyperresponsiveness may be a unique feature of senescent tumor-primed memory T cells that can exacerbate their dysfunction during cancer vaccination.">

Despite advances in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and targeted therapies, clinical responses remain heterogeneous, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of RCC immunobiology. This review comprehensively examines the immunosuppressive TME of RCC, emphasizing the roles of cytotoxic and immunosuppressive immune cells, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), abnormal vasculature, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in fostering immune evasion. This review summarized emerging biomarkers—including PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), gene mutations, and immune-based subtypes—that may predict ICI response. Furthermore, we evaluate current immunotherapeutic strategies, such as ICIs, combination therapies, and novel approaches targeting immunosuppressive cells and metabolic pathways. While combination therapies have improved outcomes, challenges like toxicity and resistance persist, necessitating biomarker-driven patient stratification and optimized treatment sequencing. Future directions should focus on deciphering TME heterogeneity and developing precision immunotherapy strategies to enhance clinical efficacy in RCC.">

        <tr id="Introduction Crohn’s disease (CD) is a relapsing inflammatory disease that is currently not curable. Despite the availability of anti-inflammatory treatments, 30–60% of patients develop resistance, necessitating the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Data from colitis models in mice indicate that granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-activated monocytes (GMaMs) may serve as a promising cellular therapy. However, it remains unclear whether inflammatory mediators, medication, or intrinsic defects impair the functionality of monocytes in active CD (aCD), potentially affecting their therapeutic efficacy. Methods Monocytes from 8 aCD patients and healthy donors (HDs) were activated in vitro with GM-CSF, and their migratory capacity, adherence, metabolic activity, surface marker expression, and cytokine release were assessed. Cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to evaluate their inflammatory response. Results The GMaM phenotype was characterized by increased metabolic activity, enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines, stronger adhesion, and remodeling of surface receptors involved in T-cell activation, compared to naïve monocytes. These features were largely comparable between aCD patients and HDs. LPS stimulation of GMaMs from both groups resulted in a significant production of pro-inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. Both are crucial recruiters of neutrophils and monocytes. Notably, monocytes from aCD patients showed an increased IL-10 response to GM-CSF, while the LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma release were reduced compared to HDs. Discussion Peripheral monocytes from aCD patients retain functional responsiveness to GM-CSF activation, displaying preserved migratory, adhesive, metabolic, and cytokine responses. Differences in cytokine production by aCD monocytes may reflect disease-specific regulation, but do not appear to limit their suitability as cellular therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells represent a unique population of innate-like T lymphocytes capable of detecting non-peptide antigens in the context of monomorphic antigen-presenting molecules. Due to their abundance in barrier tissues, reactivity to local inflammatory cues, and cytotoxic and regulatory functions, MAIT cells are poised to shape the dynamics of various tumor microenvironments. Growing evidence suggests that MAIT cells can exert protumor and/or antitumor effects in cancers arising from or metastasizing to mucosal tissues. However, MAIT cell roles in bladder cancer (BCa) remains unclear. Methods To begin to identify MAIT cells in BCa, we stained bladder tumor biopsies for T cell receptor (TCR) Vα7.2+ cells. We then refined a human MAIT cell signature, which enabled us to interrogate a bulk RNA sequencing dataset and conduct correlation analyses linking intratumoral MAIT cell abundance and mortality from BCa. To extend our work to an in vivo setting, we employed a clinically relevant mouse model in which Mr1+/+ B6-MAITCAST (MAIT-sufficient) and Mr1−/− B6-MAITCAST (MAIT-deficient) mice were exposed to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine, a chemical carcinogen associated with tobacco smoke. In additional experiments, MAIT cells were functionally removed through acetyl-6-formylpterin (Ac-6-FP) administration. Effector and regulatory cell types were phenotyped by flow cytometry, and BCa tumor burden and progression were assessed by MRI and/or H&E and Ki67 staining. Results TCR Vα7.2+ cells were readily detectable in several BCa biopsies, and our bioinformatic analyses correlated heavier MAIT cell presence in BCa tumors with poorer overall survival. Similarly, we found higher tumor burdens in Mr1+/+ B6-MAITCAST mice than in Mr1−/− or Ac-6-FP-treated animals. Bladder MAIT cells from tumor-bearing mice exhibited phenotypic MAIT17 bias based on transcription factors they harbored along with increased interleukin-17A and tumor necrosis factor-α production capacities upon stimulation. Finally, FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cell frequencies were elevated in Mr1+/+ mouse bladder tumors, likely contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, a finding that could be recapitulated in our transcriptomic studies on human BCa. Conclusions MAIT cells are abundant in BCa tumor microenvironments where they potentiate Treg cell accumulation and play protumor roles.">

 Adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies have shown limited efficacy against most solid tumors. A key barrier to success is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Beyond local effects, tumors induce systemic immune disturbances that further hinder anti-tumor immunity and promote disease progression. In this study, we investigate how tumor-driven systemic immunosuppression compromises the function of both endogenous and adoptively transferred natural killer (NK) cells, identifying potential strategies to enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes.



 We utilized syngeneic murine cancer models to systematically characterize alterations in immune cell populations within the circulation and spleen. Comprehensive and in-depth assessment of immune cell function, transcriptional activity, and metabolic state was performed using flow cytometry, Seahorse metabolic analysis, RNA sequencing, metabolic tracing, and ex vivo co-culture systems.



 In our PDAC mouse models, tumor burden elicited a robust systemic inflammatory response marked by expansion of myeloid lineage cells, particularly MDSCs, within the TME, peripheral blood, and spleen. Tumor growth led to reduced frequencies and functional deficits in both endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells in circulation and spleen. Depletion of Gr-1+ MDSCs effectively restored NK cell effector functions. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice promote NK cell dysfunction through induction of lipid peroxidation. Notably, we observed pronounced upregulation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)—a central lipid metabolism regulator—in MDSCs, which drove increased lipid oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Disruption of the ApoE-LDL receptor (LDLR) axis in MDSCs, achieved via genetic ablation, reprogrammed their metabolic activities and significantly reduced their immunosuppressive capacity toward both endogenous and transferred NK cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of lipid utilization rescued NK cell function and, when combined with NK cell adoptive transfer, produced synergistic anti-tumor effects in PDAC models.



 Our results emphasize the pivotal role of MDSC expansion in mediating systemic immunosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts. We identify the ApoE/LDLR axis as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt MDSC-driven immunosuppression, thereby enhancing the efficacy of NK cell–based immunotherapies. These findings underscore the importance of resolving systemic immune dysregulation in cancer patients to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Success of cancer immunotherapy (CIT) is intricately influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex ecosystem that encompasses immune cells, stromal elements, and extracellular components. Despite the clinical breakthroughs of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), adoptive cell therapies, cancer vaccines, and other immunotherapeutic interventions, many patients fail to respond and eventually die. Emerging evidence points to cancer stem cells (CSCs) as critical drivers of immune evasion, therapy-resistance, and tumor relapse. CSCs modulate the TME by secreting immune-suppressive factors, recruiting regulatory immune cells, and inducing phenotype-switching of anti-tumor TME subsets, thereby creating a protective niche that hinders immune surveillance. Conversely, the TME protects CSCs through hypoxia, altered metabolism, and immuno-suppressive cell populations. This bi-directional crosstalk supports tumor progression and provides resistance to immunotherapeutic strategies mainly by: (i) escaping immune-recognition and inhibiting active T cells via high immune-checkpoint molecule expression, (ii) creating immunosuppressive pro-tumor environment, and (iii) evading immune-mediated apoptosis of CSCs along with therapy-induced enrichment of their pool. Targeting CSCs in concert with reprogramming the TME via CSC-directed agents, metabolic modulators, or combinatorial immunotherapies, therefore, offers a promising avenue to overcome immunotherapy-resistance and achieve durable clinical responses. This review discusses the deeper mechanistic understanding of CSC-TME interactions, in light of designing next-generation immunotherapies with broader efficacy across diverse tumor types.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T lymphocytes are central effectors of anticancer immunity. Their abundance and spatial distribution within solid tumors are strongly correlated with patient prognosis and response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Tumors have been categorized into “hot,” “excluded,” and “cold” types based on the infiltration patterns of CD8+ T cells, which reflect the underlying immune contexture and therapeutic potential. However, many tumors remain resistant to T-cell infiltration, posing a significant barrier to immunotherapy. This review systematically outlines the seven critical steps of the Cancer-Immunity Cycle that govern CD8+ T-cell infiltration: antigen release, antigen processing and presentation, T-cell priming, trafficking through the vasculature, tumor infiltration, target recognition, and cytolytic activity. At each step, tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental barriers—including low tumor mutational burden, defective antigen-presenting machinery, immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., TGF-β, IL-10), abnormal vasculature, fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix, and inhibitory cell populations (e.g., Tregs, MDSCs, TAMs)—can stall the immune response. We further discuss the roles of immune-checkpoint signaling, metabolic competition, and suppressive cell networks in shaping T-cell exhaustion and exclusion. Cutting-edge technologies—such as single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, imaging mass cytometry, and TCR repertoire profiling—have revealed spatial and functional heterogeneity within intratumoral CD8+ T cells and informed the design of rational combination therapies. Understanding and targeting these barriers is critical for converting immune-cold tumors into immune-infiltrated, therapy-responsive states. We conclude with a perspective on the future of immunoengineering and immune-atlas integration to optimize CD8+ T-cell–based interventions in solid tumors.">

Granulocyte–Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) and Prostaglandin-E1 (PGE-1) (“Kit M”) convert blasts in patients’ whole blood (WB) into leukemia-derived dendritic cells (DCleu), enabling leukemia-specific immune reactivation after mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). We quantified immune checkpoint molecule/ligand (ICM/ICML)-expressing immune effector cells and blasts before/after Kit M treatment, examining both the WB of relapsed AML patients after allo-SCT, and healthy WB—Kit-M-pretreated (vs. not-pretreated) leukemic blood improved blast lysis after MLC. Higher frequencies of ICM co-expressing uncultured T-cells/blasts correlated negatively with blast lysis after MLC or patients’ clinical response to relapse therapy. However, post-MLC, Kit-induced blast lysis was independent of the frequencies of ICM-expressing T cells. The quantification of ICM/ICML-expressing cells could contribute to an accurate assessment of the efficacy of AML immunotherapy in future clinical applications. Kit-M has the potential to target the exhaustion status of ICM/ICML-mediated immune cells, thereby enabling the reactivation of antileukemic immune cells. This DC/DCleu-mediated mechanism could contribute to improvements in therapy as well as the outcome in relapsed AML patients after allo-HCT.">

        <tr id="Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing global health concern, and hemodialysis (HD) remains the most common life-sustaining therapy for patients with advanced kidney failure. Both humoral and cellular immunity are impaired post hemodialysis, leading to immune system dysfunction. Methods: We utilized flow cytometry to quantify cell populations based on surface markers, including CD3 (total T lymphocytes), CD4 (helper T-cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T-cells), CD19 (B lymphocytes), and CD16/CD56 (natural killer (NK) cells). EDTA-blood samples were collected intravenously immediately before and after dialysis. Results: A consistent decline in CD3+ T lymphocytes was observed post hemodialysis. This reduction occurred across both male and female cohorts: p = 0.0342 and p = 0.0002, respectively. CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells decreased significantly post HD, p = 0.0003. Conversely, CD4+ helper T-cells exhibited a paradoxical increase, p = 0.0321. The divergent trends in CD4+ and CD8+ cells led to a statistically significant increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio post dialysis, p = 0.0005. Notably, stratification by gender uncovered that the post-HD changes in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were exclusive to female patients. Females demonstrated a pronounced increase in CD4+ cells and a sharper decline in CD8+ cells compared to males. CD19+ B lymphocytes showed a statistically significant decline post hemodialysis (p < 0.0001). While both genders exhibited reduced B-cell percentages, female patients experienced a more pronounced reduction than males. NK cells were severely depleted post dialysis in both male and female cohorts. Conclusions: Overall, the immune alterations observed in HD patients, including T-cell reduction, B-cell lymphopenia, and changes in NK cell populations, contribute to the increased risk of infections, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease in this population.">

 Fractionated focal radiation therapy (RT) induces immunogenic cell death and activates the type I interferon pathway via the cGAS/STING pathway, promoting tumor antigen cross-presentation by conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and driving tumor-specific T-cell activation. However, the impact of RT on tumor regression is often limited by its complex effects on the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME). Several studies have shown that RT increases both the frequency and functional activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), due in part to their intrinsic radioresistance and to RT-induced modulation of recruitment signals such as TGFβ, CCL17, and CCL221-2. In a recent study, we showed that RT combined with immunotherapy can remodel the TiME3, et persistent infiltration of activated Tregs can dampen the full immunostimulatory effects of RT-driven viral mimicry responses4. Here, we evaluated whether combining RT with blockade of the myeloid checkpoint SIRPα could modulate Treg infiltration and activity. Using mouse models of luminal (TSA) and triple-negative (AT3) breast cancer, we tested RT in combination with a blocking anti-SIRPα antibody (MY1; SIRPα-b). While MY1 monotherapy showed minimal activity, its combination with RT led to enhanced regression of irradiated tumors and inhibition of non-irradiated (abscopal) tumor growth in both tumor models. This effect was lost upon conditional cDC depletion using Zbtb46-DTR mice, highlighting the importance of cDCs in mediating the therapeutic synergy. To dissect the immune mechanisms underlying this synergy, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing and CITE-seq on CD45+ tumor-infiltrating cells from TSA tumors treated with RT ± SIRPα-b. We observed a significant reduction in Treg infiltration in SIRPα-b–treated tumors, with or without RT. Furthermore, expression of Treg activation markers OX40, CTLA-4, and GITR was reduced, particularly in the RT + SIRPα-b group. Among infiltrating CD45+ cells, expression of Treg recruiting Ccl22 and Ccl17 chemokines was observed only in a highly activated cluster of CCR7high cDCs expressing SIRPα, CXCL16, PD-L1, and IL-15Rα. Notably, expression of both chemokines was strongly decreased following SIRPα-b treatment, suggesting that SIRPα signaling supports Treg recruitment via this cDC population.Studies to understand the mechanisms of Treg recruitment to the tumor via chemokine secretion by CCR7high cDCs and their role in tumor regression after RT + SIRPα-b are underway. Intra-tumoral CCR7high cDCs are known to support the activation and cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in the tumor through transpresentation of Il-155. Our results suggest that this population also plays a key immunoregulatory role in shaping the TiME. Targeting the CD47/SIRPα axis may thus improve RT efficacy by modulating the dual functions of CCR7high cDCs in both effector stimulation and Treg recruitment.

Notable advancements in patient survival have been achieved due to the clinical application of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) and bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs). However, the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the bone marrow hinders the effectiveness of these novel immunotherapies, consequently restricting their efficacy. Hence, it is imperative to clarify the exact mechanisms to devise strategies aimed at improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of recent research concerning the different T cell subtypes in the immune evasion mechanisms of MM.

Despite advancements in surgical techniques, chemotherapies, and novel therapeutic approaches, the overall survival rates remain bleak, primarily due to the complex and dynamic tumor microenvironment (TME) which fosters cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. Central to the TME are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which exhibit significant heterogeneity and play multifaceted roles in tumor progression, ranging from remodeling the extracellular matrix to modulating immune responses. Recent breakthroughs in single-cell sequencing and spatial omics have unraveled the diverse functional states and spatial organization of various cell types within the TME, including distinct subtypes of CAFs which differ vastly in their influence on pancreatic cancer pathophysiology. This review delves into the intricate interactions between CAFs and pancreatic cancer cells, highlighting how metabolic reprogramming and immune regulation by CAFs contribute to the high malignancy of PDAC. By integrating single-cell and spatial resolution data, we offer new insights into the metabolic crosstalk and immune landscape remodeling driven by CAFs, establishing a foundation for targeting these stromal interactions in therapeutic strategies.">

 Glioblastoma, the most common and lethal primary brain tumor, creates profound immunosuppression that has resisted clinical interventions. The mechanisms behind immunotherapy failures in glioblastoma remain unclear. We conducted a systematic comparison of different immunotherapeutic approaches in mouse models to better understand treatment responses.



 Using multiomic single-cell analysis and spatial profiling, we evaluated GL261 glioma-bearing mice treated with anti-PD-L1 antibodies, NKG2D-CAR-expressing T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, or macrophages.



 All treatment models induced immune cell migration through chemotaxis. Additionally, PD-L1 and CAR T cell treatments led to an exhaustion-associated T cell signature alongside increased cytotoxic T cell presence. Further, we observed higher numbers of immunomodulatory lymphocytes and macrophages associated with these two immunotherapies. CAR macrophages and CAR NK cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxic gene signatures without increasing T cell numbers. Also, the immunomodulatory macrophage response appeared attenuated in CAR NK cells and macrophages. Notably, CAR NK cells demonstrated an enhanced antiviral response with interferon-beta expression that was not observed in other models.



 While PD-L1 and CAR cell treatments successfully polarized the lymphoid compartment toward cytotoxic phenotypes, these approaches alone appear insufficient as they were accompanied by pronounced immunomodulatory cell responses. CAR NK cells and macrophages were characterized by attenuated immunomodulatory responses. Our findings suggest that cytotoxic lymphocytes alone fail to override tumor-associated immune suppression. This is in line with recent evidence on T helper cell roles in CAR therapy. Future immunotherapy approaches should balance cytotoxic and helper lymphocyte populations while enhancing inflammatory macrophages to overcome the immunosuppressive environment of glioblastoma

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has fundamentally reshaped oncology by harnessing the immune system to eliminate malignant cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 have achieved durable remissions in select cancers, yet most patients exhibit resistance due to tumor heterogeneity, immunometabolic rewiring, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To address these limitations, next-generation immunotherapies have emerged, targeting multiple layers of immune regulation. These include co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory checkpoint modulators, bispecific antibodies, adoptive cell therapies, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, cytokine-based strategies, and synthetic immunomodulators that activate innate sensors. Nanotechnology and in vivo immune engineering further enhance specificity, reduce toxicity, and broaden applicability. Combination immunotherapy has become central to overcoming resistance, with rational regimens integrating ICIs, cytokines, vaccines, and targeted agents. Biomarker-guided strategies, leveraging tumor mutational burden, immune cell infiltration, and multi-omic profiling, are enabling personalized approaches. However, immune-related adverse events and variability in therapeutic responses necessitate predictive biomarkers and improved patient stratification. Emerging frontiers include microbiome-targeted interventions, chronotherapy, and AI-driven modeling of tumor–immune dynamics. Equally critical is ensuring global equity through inclusive trial design, diverse biomarker validation, and expanded access to cutting-edge therapies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of multimodal immunotherapeutic strategies, their mechanistic basis, and clinical integration. By unifying innovation in immunology, synthetic biology, and systems medicine, next-generation cancer immunotherapy is poised to transition from a transformative intervention to a curative paradigm across malignancies.">

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the most prevalent and lethal form of lung cancer worldwide. Among the diverse components of the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are increasingly recognized as key regulators of NSCLC progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. TAMs, particularly those polarized toward the M2-like phenotype, facilitate tumor growth through immunosuppression, angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling. They promote immune evasion via PD-L1, IL-10, and TGF-β signaling, and confer chemoresistance through activation of the IL-6/STAT3 and P2X7/STAT6 pathways. Moreover, high infiltration of M2-TAMs and their expression of immune checkpoint ligands have been associated with poor prognosis and, paradoxically, with improved response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in certain patients. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram TAM phenotypes, inhibit their recruitment, or selectively suppress their immunosuppressive functions. However, challenges such as macrophage plasticity, lack of specific biomarkers, and potential systemic toxicity remain significant barriers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biological functions, mechanistic roles, and clinical implications of TAMs in NSCLC, highlighting both their value as prognostic indicators and their potential as therapeutic targets in the era of precision oncology.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer and there is mounting evidence that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a role in the pathogenesis of haematologic malignancies as well as treatment resistance. Macrophages play a central role in anti-tumor immunity, and dysregulation of macrophage mediated phagocytosis has recently emerged as a key player in blood cancers. The integrin associated protein CD47 is expressed in a variety of cancers and interacts with its ligand, signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on macrophages, resulting in down regulation of macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. CD47 is highly expressed in various cancers including multiple myeloma (MM). It is therefore postulated that blockade of the CD47-SIRPα immune checkpoint has the potential to ‘re-awaken’ macrophage mediated phagocytosis of MM plasma cells. In this review, we provide our perspective on the key pre-clinical data supporting the CD47-SIRPα axis as a therapeutic target in MM. We subsequently discuss the ongoing clinical trials which may provide the basis for future clinical translation of these agents. We also highlight key gaps in our knowledge of macrophage biology in MM which need to be addressed by future research. Finally, we present potential future directions for translational research and personalized application of macrophage-based immunotherapy in MM.

On one hand, uncontrolled cell death accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage.

These mechanisms have emerged as promising targets for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics, immunotherapies, and vaccines. Recent advances have elucidated key aspects of cell death and DAMP pathways, highlighting their association with upstream viral sensors, their capacity to regulate immune responses, and their potential as therapeutic targets in the context of respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has transformed the landscape of cancer treatment, offering hope to patients who were once considered beyond the reach of effective care. However, its success is restricted to a limited fraction of patients. This discrepancy in response is largely due to the complex and dynamic nature of the tumor immune-microenvironment. At the heart of this complexity is the concept of cancer immunoediting—a dynamic process through which the immune system both sculpts and is shaped by the tumor. This process unfolds in three key stages: Elimination, Equilibrium, and Escape, each representing a shifting balance between immune defenses and tumor adaptation. Central to this interaction are tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TILs are frontline defenders in targeting tumor cells, while TAMs can either hinder or facilitate tumor growth based on their polarization. As cancer progresses, immune selection pressure induces phenotypic alterations that promote immune evasion, fostering an environment detrimental to effective immune response. This review explores the role of these immunological components in each phase of immunoediting and their impact on the efficacy or failure of immunotherapy. Gaining deeper insight into these interactions is crucial for developing advanced immunotherapies that reshape tumor microenvironment and expand the reach of immunotherapy to more patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Natural killer (NK) cells are pivotal effectors in innate antitumor immunity by mediating cytotoxicity, secreting cytokines, or expressing cell membrane receptors, which facilitate interactions with other immune cells. The cytotoxic activity and immune function of NK cells are governed by dynamic receptor–ligand interactions, cytokine networks, and metabolic–epigenetic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent years, NK cell‐based therapies are emerging as a promising clinical approach for antitumor treatment, owing to their rapid response, unique recognition mechanisms, potent cytotoxic capabilities, and memory‐like characteristics, along with their low risk of posttreatment adverse effects and cost effectiveness. However, immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming driven by TME subvert NK cell surveillance, impairing its antitumor function. This review comprehensively details molecular mechanisms underpinning NK cell dysfunction, including dysregulated activating/inhibitory receptor signaling, metabolic reprogramming, and epigenetic silencing of effector genes. We further synthesize advances in clinical strategies to restore NK cytotoxicity including ex vivo expansion for adoptive transfer, chimeric antigen receptor‐NK engineering, TME‐remodeling agents, immune checkpoint blockade, cytokine‐based therapies, and NK cell engagers targeting tumor antigens. By bridging mechanistic insights with translational applications, this work provides a framework for rationally designed NK cell‐based immunotherapies to overcome resistance across solid and hematologic malignancies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Sepsis, caused by an unbalanced host response to infection, remains a global health burden. The dysregulation between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is a primary driver of immune imbalance. As a central player in adaptive immunity, CD4+ T cells are crucial for maintaining this balance during sepsis by differentiating into various effector T cell subsets. Thus, elucidating the underlying mechanisms within the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance in CD4+ T cell subsets during sepsis is of great value. We first identified the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) as a significantly upregulated gene in CD4+ T cells from sepsis patients by conducting a comprehensive transcriptome meta-analysis. The expression of PIM1 was significantly elevated on CD4+ T cells from sepsis patients and was correlated with both SOFA and APACHE II scores. Moreover, we found that PIM1 promoted the differentiation of CD4+IFN-γ+ Th1 and CD4+IL-17A+ Th17 subsets while inhibiting the differentiation of CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs. Additionally, upon inhibiting PIM1 kinase activity in CD4+ T cells, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the cholesterol metabolism gene, ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), exhibited significant upregulation. More importantly, we found that the intracellular cholesterol content was decreased in CD4+ T cells after inhibiting the PIM1 kinase activity or knocking down PIM1. The portion of CD4+IFN-γ+ Th1 and CD4+IL-17A+ Th17 cells was recovered, and the CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs decreased after cholesterol supplementation to CD4+ T cells. These findings indicated that PIM1 may regulate the balance of Th1, Th17, and Treg subsets in a cholesterol-dependent manner in sepsis. IMPORTANCE This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance of CD4+ T cell subsets during sepsis. Our study provides evidence that PIM1 serves as a crucial regulator of sepsis-induced inflammation and elucidates that PIM1 participates in regulating the imbalance of Th1, Th17, and Treg subsets, further promoting inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance in sepsis. Additionally, the cholesterol metabolism, potentially mediated by ABCG1, is implicated in PIM1’s regulatory effect on the Th1, Th17, and Treg imbalance. Our study provides novel insights into the inflammatory imbalance during sepsis, which could facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the immune-inflammatory cascade in this condition.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a unique subset of T cells vital for maintaining immune balance, preventing autoimmune diseases, and controlling immune responses. First identified in the early 1990s, Tregs are now well recognized for their role in suppressing excessive immune reactions and promoting tolerance to the body’s tissues. Among the broader Treg population, Tissue regulatory T cells (Tissue Tregs) are distinct as they do more than suppress immunity; they actively contribute to tissue repair and regeneration. Studies in both mice and humans have highlighted the important role of in aiding tissue repair and maintaining tissue integrity. Recent research reveals that Tregs participate in wound healing and tissue regeneration across various organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys, muscles, lungs, bones, and central nervous system. These discoveries emphasize the wide-ranging and significant influence of Tregs in fostering recovery and healing in different tissues throughout the body. These cells are characterized by their ability to produce a variety of growth factors, cytokines, and signaling molecules that support the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues. In this review, we present an overview of the emerging understanding of Treg-mediated repair processes in damaged tissues and organs.">

        <tr id="Introduction Salmonella-induced colitis is a global health burden characterized by intestinal barrier disruption and deficient epithelial repair that involves a critical interplay between neutrophil dynamics and intestinal stem cell (ISC) regeneration. Current therapies do not target this interplay and do not adequately address therapeutic need. This study investigated the therapeutic mechanism of asiatic acid (AA) in a murine Salmonella typhimurium (S.T) infection model, focusing on its effects on the neutrophil-Notch-ISC axis. Methods Balb/c mice were administered S.T for 3 days to model S.T infection AA (10 mg/kg) was gavage administered to mice 6 h after the S.T infection. Neutrophil-deficient mice were generated by daily intraperitoneal injection of Ly6G for 3 days. Results Mouse colons were analyzed histologically, and transcriptomic, network pharmacology, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry investigations were performed. AA restored mucosal integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin 1) and acidic mucin granules levels, and by rescuing ISC proliferation through suppression of Notch2/Hes5/Hey1 signaling. Multiomics analyses further revealed the modulation of neutrophil chemotaxis and inflammatory pathways by AA. Strikingly, neutrophil ablation reduced the efficacy of AA, confirming that AA acts via neutrophil-mediated containment of bacterial invasion and epithelial shedding. Discussion By revealing the neutrophil-Notch2-ISC axis as a pivotal regulator of mucosal repair, our findings show AA to be a dual-action therapeutic agent that synergizes immune containment and regenerative pathways. These findings highlight an aspect of S.T pathogenesis and underscore the potential of natural compounds to harmonize host defense and tissue regeneration, offering a transformative strategy for infectious colitis beyond conventional anti-inflammatory approaches">

 Despite recent advances in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) biology and new therapies, this aggressive subtype remains difficult to treat. A key obstacle is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), often dominated by myeloid cells that impair anti-tumor immunity. Radiation therapy (RT), used as an in-situ vaccine, enhances tumor immunogenicity and has shown promise when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical and clinical settings1-3. We previously found that combining RT with CTLA-4 blockade and a CD40 agonist antibody (CD40a), which activates myeloid cells, led to profound tumor regression and occasional complete responses in a rapidly metastasizing TNBC mouse model4. However, CD40a did not improve control of lung metastases beyond that achieved with RT and CTLA-4 blockade. In tumors, CD40a induced remodeling of dendritic cell and macrophage populations, along with enrichment in B cell–associated gene signatures. As CD40 signaling can promote either effector or regulatory B cell responses depending on context5, we hypothesized that triple therapy induces organ-specific B cell differentiation that may hinder systemic immune control. We first assessed systemic versus local effects of CD40a on B cells in naïve and tumor-bearing (4T1) mice. In both settings, CD40a expanded splenic B cells and increased MHC-II+ expression. In lungs, tumor implantation alone led to increased B cell infiltration, even without CD40a. However, these lung B cells showed reduced activation in untreated tumor-bearing mice, only partially restored by CD40a, suggesting a distinct, potentially immunosuppressive phenotype. To evaluate this in the context of RT + CTLA-4 blockade + CD40a, we analyzed B cells from lungs and tumors via multiparametric flow cytometry and observed that CD40a consistently shifted B cell profiles across compartments. Among B cells, we identified regulatory B cells (Breg) as expressing TIM1, CD138, CD5, CD39, and FasL. CD40a decreased Breg infiltration in tumors but significantly increased it in lungs. In both tissues, Breg marker expression correlated with tumor or lung burden. Given TIM1’s role in IL-10–producing Bregs—and its capacity to suppress T cells independently of IL-10—6-8 we tested a TIM1-blocking antibody in combination with RT + CTLA-4 blockade + CD40a. While TIM1 blockade did not enhance tumor control, it markedly reduced lung Bregs. Our data highlight organ-specific B cell responses following CD40a-based immunotherapy and suggest that lung-resident Bregs may limit systemic immune efficacy. Ongoing work focuses on defining mechanisms of Breg-mediated suppression and, in collaboration with bioengineers, on developing intra-tumoral delivery strategies to reduce systemic immunosuppressive effects of agents like CD40a. 1-PMID: 29180535 2-PMID: 33476307 3-PMID: 30397353 4-PMID: 37620372 5-PMID: 19265127 6-PMID: 25582854 7-PMID: 31511630 8-PMID: 31685302

        <tr id="Background The programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1 or PD-1) is a key regulatory immune checkpoint and a major target for therapeutic intervention. In oncology, antibodies blocking the PD-1 pathway are used to activate immune cells to promote anti tumour immunity while in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, PD-1 agonist molecules have the potential to achieve immune suppression. NK cells are a specialised population of innate lymphocytes able to recognize a large range of distressed cells including damaged tissues in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Of note, NK cells can upregulate PD-1 expression upon activation and their effector functions can be modulated by the PD-1 signalling pathway. Methods We have generated a novel bispecific inhibitory molecule, comprised of a targeting domain highly specific for a pre-pro-insulin peptide presented by the HLA-A*02 molecules on the cell surface of pancreatic β-cells and a PD-1 agonist effector domain. Suppressive effects of the β-cell tethered bispecific PD-1 agonist molecule on NK cells and NK92-PD-1 cell line activation were assessed through gene expression, cell surface expression of the CD107a degranulation marker, intracellular IFNγ production and Granzyme B secretion. EndoC-b cells proliferation and insulin production were also measured. Results We observed that the bispecific PD-1 agonist molecules tethered to pancreatic b-cells accumulate at the immunological synapse, modify NK cell gene expression and decrease their inflammatory and cytotoxic functions. Conclusions Targeted PD-1 agonist molecules, inhibiting T cells and NK cells in a tissue-specific manner offer a new promising treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal meningitis is a fungal infection in patients with compromised CD4 T cell function. CD4 T cells provide killing signals to macrophages, principally IFNγ, to limit intracellular fungal replication. However, CD4 T cells may also drive inflammatory tissue damage. Yet, it is not fully understood how fungal-specific CD4 T cells infiltrate the brain and how they influence functional phenotypes of CNS-resident myeloid cells. In the current work, we develop a mouse model to track fungal-specific CD4 T cells and determine their influence on microglia. We found IFNγ+ fungal-specific CD4 T cells have limited TCR signalling and characterise a population of inflammatory microglia that upregulate MHCII and IFNγ-regulated genes during infection. Inflammatory microglia have poor fungicidal capacity and significantly expand during infection, a process that depends on CD4 T cell infiltration. Taken together, these data identify the early inflammatory consequences of fungal-specific CD4 T cell infiltration and identify proliferating microglia as important drivers of brain inflammation during infection.">

 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are major negative regulators of anti-tumor immunity. Identifying tumor secreting factors and signaling pathways that enhance their pro-tumorigenic activity could lead to new strategies to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. We have identified tumor-secreted epidermal growth factor-like 6 (EGFL6) as a new mediator of tumor immune suppression. In-vitro and ex-vivo analyses indicated that EGFL6 binds beta integrins to activate spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling, functioning as (i) a chemotactic factor for myeloid cell migration and (ii) a driver of their differentiation into immunosuppressive phenotypes. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer, EGFL6 expression promoted intra-tumoral accumulation of MDSCs and TAMs with high SYK, CXCL2, and IL-10 expression. In an immune ‘hot’ tumor model, EGFL6 completely abrogated the response to anti-PD-L1 therapy, whereas Egfl6 neutralization decreased the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD206+ TAMs and MDSCs and thereby restored the efficacy of a-PD-L1 therapy. Spatial transcriptomic datasets of human ovarian cancer tissues revealed strong correlation between tumor EGFL6 and myeloid cell SYK expression. Dual immunohistochemistry confirmed increased SYK+ macrophages in ovarian cancer compared to normal ovary. We therefore tested whether SYK inhibition could hinder EGFL6-induced signaling in myeloid cells and reprogram them from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory phenotype. Treatment with the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (R788) prolonged survival in Egfl6+/- ID8p53-/- tumor-bearing mice, reduced the number of intra-tumoral granulocytic MDSCs, and decreased VEGF, M-CSF, and CXCL5 levels in ascites. scRNA-seq revealed that SYK inhibition depleted specific CCL8+ TAM and CXCL2+ MDSC subsets, induced immunostimulatory myeloid cell populations, and reduced exhausted of TIGIT+CTL4+ CD8 T cells. These findings demonstrate that targeting the EGFL6-SYK axis, via EGFL6 blockade or SYK inhibition, can reprogram the ovarian tumor microenvironment to enhance anti-tumor immunity and restore responsiveness of “cold” tumors to immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Pediatric oral rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare and aggressive cancer of the head and neck, characterized by a complex and mostly immunosuppressive tumor–immune microenvironment. Unlike adult cancers, pediatric RMS typically exhibits a “cold” immune profile, characterized by minimal T-cell infiltration, a low mutational burden, and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. The tumor’s location in the oral cavity adds difficulty to treatment because of anatomical and functional limitations. Additionally, the presence of fusion oncogenes, such as PAX3:FOXO1, hampers immunogenicity and treatment response by disrupting antigen presentation and reducing immune cell infiltration. Advances in immuno-oncology have introduced new strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies, cancer vaccines, and oncolytic viruses. However, these approaches face specific challenges in the pediatric population due to developmental immune factors. This narrative review highlights recent findings on the immunobiology of pediatric oral RMS, focusing on tumor–immune interactions and their impact on disease progression and treatment resistance. We reviewed the cellular components of the TIME, the mechanisms of immune evasion, and the expression of immune checkpoints, including PD-L1 and B7-H3. Emerging immunotherapies, including CAR-T, CAR-NK, and CAR-CIK cell therapies; checkpoint inhibitors; oncolytic viruses; and cancer vaccines, are discussed, with an emphasis on their current limitations and potential to transform the pediatric RMS immune landscape.">

Therefore, next‐generation cancer immunotherapies would emerge from deepened mechanistic insights on the full spectrum of cellular and molecular interactions between cancer cells and their immune sentinels. This review embarks on an exhaustive exploration of the cardinal immunological principles that catalyze robust cancer surveillance and their potential escapes and recapitulate the state‐of‐art understanding of both receptors and corresponding immune cell types involved. Both tumor intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental mediators of immune escapes are outlined in the context of current clinic applications. Following emphasizing the exceptional requisites that effective cancer immunity cycle must meet, specific cellular subsets crucial for igniting tumor immunity, notably effector and helper T cells alongside antigen presentation cells are examined, focusing on their close interactions in both antigen‐dependent and ‐independent manners. Such intricate interactions form dynamic immune hubs at the tumor site, holding promising key functionality in rendering effective cancer retreat. Grounded on these recent insights, refined immunotherapeutic strategies, especially those bolstering priming based anticancer effector functions are advocated.">

        <tr id="Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) has been implicated in multiple inflammatory diseases by regulating pro-inflammatory mediators or altering immune cell polarization. However, the expression and direct functional role of CB1 in T cells remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that primary murine T cells express CB1 and that its novel agonist, BI-5756, directly increases the frequencies of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in primary murine pan T cells after activation. In addition, BI-5756 exhibits an in vivo protective effect against graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), an allogeneic T cell-mediated inflammatory complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), resulting in an improved overall survival with enhanced platelet recovery and reconstitution of bone marrow-derived B and T cells. BI-5756 also directly suppresses tumor cell growth and upregulates MHC I, MHC II, and CD80 on tumor cells, which may subsequently enhance T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses in mixed lymphocyte reaction with A20 cells. The ability of BI-5756 to increase Tregs was significantly abrogated by rimonabant, a potent and selective CB1 antagonist, suggesting that the immunomodulatory effect of BI-5756 is mediated via CB1. In summary, BI-5756, a potent CB1 agonist, increases Tregs while preserving anti-tumor responses in vitro and effectively reduces GvHD in vivo.">

 Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) is a cutting-edge treatment strategy modulating T cell activity and has emerged at the forefront of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) management, yet most patients do not durably respond. Studies have shown that innate immune cells could create an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) thus, resulting in resistance to ICB. Therefore, to design an effective therapeutic strategy, it is imperative to consider the diverse immune cells and their complex interactome. In noncancerous conditions, pro-inflammatory neutrophils release extracellular traps or NETs that interfere with monocyte differentiation to macrophages. However, their interaction and its effect in mediating immune evasion in NSCLCs is poorly understood.



 To study the role of neutrophils in macrophage behaviour, freshly isolated monocytes were differentiated into pro-tumorigenic M2-like macrophages and polarized with or without NETs. These NETs-educated macrophages (NeMacs) were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. Functionally, their role in the TME was investigated using a Tumor-Immune-Microenvironment on-chip (TIMEoC) platform. Here, immune cells such as donor matched T cells or neutropils were loaded into a microfluidic channel magnetically attached to active NSCLC spheroids embedded in a collagenous matrix containing NeMacs. T-cell or neutrophil migration and tumor cytotoxicity in the presence of NeMacs were monitored on TIMEoC.



 In the presence of NETs, macrophages presented an immunosuppresive phenotype with significantly reduced expression of CD80, a key co-stimulatory receptor for T cell activation. NeMacs recruited significantly more neutrophils to the tumor than M2-like macrophages. In contrast, NeMacs retarded activated CD8+ T cell migration to the TME and significantly impacted their cytotoxic abilities observed by caspase 3/7 expression. The presence of NeMacs also affected ICB efficacy in vitro.



 Therefore, NETs could reprogram macrophages to create an immune-suppressive TME. This study was able to unveil previously unexplored relationship between NETs and macrophages in NSCLCs which could help identify prospective targets that could augment the current standard of care.

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is defined by a myeloid-enriched microenvironment and has shown remarkable resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD-1 and CTLA-4). Here, we sought to define the role of myeloid immunosuppression in immune resistance in PDA. We report that depletion of CSF1R+ myeloid cells in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy triggers T cell infiltration into PDA but causes compensatory remodeling of the myeloid compartment with limited tumor control. Unexpectedly, combined therapy against multiple myeloid targets including CSF1R, CCR2/5 and CXCR2 was insufficient to overcome treatment resistance. High-dimensional single cell analyses performed on T cell infiltrates in human and mouse PDA revealed upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4. Combinatorial blockade of PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4 along with chemotherapy and anti-CSF1R was necessary to trigger activation of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and led to deep, durable, and complete tumor responses, with each immune checkpoint blockade agent contributing to efficacy. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive approach targeting both negative regulatory signals controlling T cell function and the myeloid compartment will be fundamental to unveiling the potential of immunotherapy in PDA.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Melanoma is recognized as a highly malignant cancer with a generally poor prognosis, underscoring the critical need for effective therapeutic strategies. Adoptive cell therapy has emerged as a promising modality to improve treatment outcomes in melanoma. For endogenous cell therapy (ECT), peripheral blood (PB) has traditionally served as the primary cell source. However, the potential of umbilical cord blood (UCB) as an alternative source for ECT remains unclear. Furthermore, the repertoire of TCRs remains limited. These deficiencies impede the optimization and broader application of ECT for melanoma, highlighting the necessity for focused investigations to resolve these issues. Methods To evaluate the effects of HLA‐A2 restricted antigen‐specific CD8⁺ T cells on melanoma cells, the cytotoxic activity of CD8⁺ T cells derived from UCB and PB were conducted in vivo and in vitro assays. Single‐cell RNA sequencing combined with TCR V(D)J sequencing was employed to characterize cellular composition and quantify the frequencies of specific TCR clonotypes. The generation probability and peripheral occurrence probability of antigen‐specific CD8⁺ TCR sequences from UCB and PB were computed using the Simple Olga Sonia algorithm. Finally, molecular docking simulations were conducted to predict the binding affinity between isolated TCRs and pMHC. Results No significant differences were observed in the cytotoxic effects mediated by antigen‐specific CD8⁺ T cells derived from UCB versus PB. Phenotypic analysis revealed that PB‐derived antigen‐specific CD8⁺ T cells were predominantly effector and proliferating cells, whereas those from UCB consisted largely of memory cells. TCR sequencing identified a greater diversity of antigen‐specific TCR clonotypes in PB, meanwhile UCB‐derived TCRs exhibited strong pMHC binding. Molecular docking simulations confirmed high binding affinity between pMHC and TCR clones isolated from both sources. Conclusions Antigen‐specific CD8⁺ T cells from UCB and PB display comparable cytotoxic efficacy against melanoma, albeit with distinct compositional profiles of antigen‐specific CD8⁺ T cell subsets. Candidate TCRs can be effectively activated by the tumor‐associated antigens MART1 and gp100. This activation promotes the expansion of the available TCR repertoires, thereby mitigating the previous constraint of a limited TCR library. Key points Endogenous T‐celltherapy for melanoma has used adult peripheral blood as the cell source andachieved certain results, but the cellular components of effector T cells werenot clear. At the same time, it was not clear whether umbilical cord bloodcould be used as a cell resource bank for endogenous T‐cell therapy. This studydemonstrated that T cells from umbilical cord blood can be used as a cellresource bank for endogenous T‐cell therapy. It further clarified that thereare different components of antigen‐specific T cells in umbilical cord bloodand peripheral blood. Antigen‐specific T cells from peripheral blood are mainlyproliferative T cells, while those from umbilical cord blood are mainlyeffector T cells and memory T cells. Finally, TCR sequencing was used to obtainTCRs that can target melanoma, expanding the corresponding TCR database.">

NEUs exacerbate mucosal injury through reactive oxygen species (ROS), neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), proteases, and cytokine interactions, while also exhibiting dual roles in tissue repair. Macrophages contribute to UC progression via M1-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine release and epithelial barrier disruption, whereas M2 macrophages promote resolution through anti-inflammatory signals (IL-10, TGF-β) and epithelial regeneration. Clinically, NEU-derived biomarkers predict disease activity and therapeutic response, while macrophage-targeted therapies modulate inflammation.

Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the migratory behaviors of key immune cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, regulatory T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils and the molecular mechanisms that guide their trafficking from lymphoid organs to inflamed tissues. We highlight the stepwise migration cascade: priming in secondary lymphoid organs, trafficking through blood vessels, adhesion to endothelium, and extravasation into tissues. Each step is critically regulated by chemokines, selectins, integrins, and proteases. We also examine current pharmacological strategies that target immune cell migration in inflammatory diseases, such as integrin blockers and chemokine receptor antagonists, emphasizing both therapeutic potential and clinical limitations. In addition, we discuss emerging technologies including intravital imaging, CRISPR-based screening, and computational modeling that provide novel insights into immune cell dynamics and may guide the development of next generation migration-targeted therapies. Overall, this review integrates fundamental immunological principles with translational medicine by identifying key challenges, unresolved controversies, and future directions in the therapeutic modulation of immune cell migration.">

While the exact pathogenesis of CLE remains incompletely understood, accumulating evidence highlights the pivotal role of interferon (IFN) as a central mediator in disease initiation and progression. Stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells within CLE lesions demonstrate elevated expression of IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs), establishing a characteristic IFN signature. IFN orchestrates multiple pathological processes, including chemokine‐mediated immune cell recruitment, cutaneous inflammation cascade, and tissue fibrosis. This review systematically examines the IFN‐CLE axis through an integrated analysis of in vitro and in vivo experimental data. Emerging clinical trials reveal therapeutic promise in strategies targeting plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), neutralizing IFN signaling, or blocking downstream pathways. Given the current limitations in CLE management, IFN‐focused strategies may offer innovative solutions to address unmet clinical needs through precision immunomodulation.">

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has shown remarkable efficacy in RRMM. However, limitations such as antigen escape, tumor heterogeneity, and T-cell exhaustion led to relapse. This review provides a comprehensive perspective on the transformative potential of bispecific CAR-T cell therapy as a promising strategy to overcome resistance and improve outcomes for patients with RRMM. The mechanisms of resistance to BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapy are comprehensively analyzed and categorized into BCMA-positive and BCMA-negative relapse/refractory mechanisms. The MIF/CD74 pathway as a potential contributor to BCMA CAR-T resistance was supported by single-cell RNA sequencing data and previous studies. The mechanistic advantages of dual-target are explored dual target CAR-T can prevent antigen escape and enhance T-cell activation. Clinical review of clinical trial data demonstrates the superior efficacy of bispecific CAR-T compared to BCMA CAR-T, including higher drug effect and more manageable side effects.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AR-NHL), a leading malignancy among people living with HIV (PLWH), may not receive standard intensive curative therapies as the general population due to immune deficiency concerns, even in the combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and immunochemotherapy era. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of T-cell subsets landscapes is urgently needed to grasp the complex and dynamic role of the immune system in AR-NHL patients’ survival. Materials and methods This longitudinal cohort study enrolled 31 de novo adult AR-NHL patients and 52 HIV-negative NHL controls. Multi-color flow cytometry profiled peripheral blood immunophenotypes at baseline and during immunochemotherapy. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses evaluated associations between baseline risk factors and clinical outcomes. Results AR-NHL patients exhibited comparable 1-year overall survival (71.0% vs. 74.8%) and progression-free survival (60.4% vs. 64.6%) to HIV-negative NHL individuals. Baseline β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and EBER positivity were higher in AR-NHL. AR-NHL revealed persistent immune senescence during immunochemotherapy, including reduced CD4+ T cells, lower CD4/CD8 ratio, decreased Tregs, naïve CD45RA+, and memory CD45RO + CD4+ T cells, alongside elevated Tregs/CD4, CD8+, CD8 + CD28+, and CD8 + CD28− T cells, highlighting the complex HIV-driven immune compromise. Multivariate analysis identified baseline circulating CD8 + CD28− T cells as an independent predictor of inferior prognosis in AR-NHL, correlated with aggressive disease markers such as elevated β2-MG, hypoproteinemia, decreased CD4/CD8 ratio, high International Prognostic Index score, and EBER positivity. Conclusions AR-NHL patients warrant standard full-dose cancer therapy to improve prognosis despite immunocompromised and immunosenescence phenotypes. CD8 + CD28− T cells serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for AR-NHL, potentially associated with chronic immune activation and viral exposure. Our data suggest that characterizing T-cell subsets may enhance understanding of immune dynamics in AR-NHL, providing a foundation for exploring personalized approaches to infection prophylaxis.">

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains a formidable malignancy with persistently poor clinical outcomes. Recent research has underscored the pivotal role of the innate immune system, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a key component of the myeloid lineage, in orchestrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and shaping disease progression. As professional phagocytes of the innate immune system, macrophages not only mediate pathogen recognition and inflammatory responses but also undergo functional polarization in response to local cues. In OSCC, dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, marked by the overrepresentation of species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis—acts as a chronic inflammatory trigger that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune evasion, and tumor growth. These pathogenic bacteria actively engage innate immune signaling pathways such as TLRs and CSF-1R, skewing macrophages toward an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. M2-like TAMs then contribute to tumor progression by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), promoting angiogenesis, and expressing immune checkpoint ligands such as PD-L1. This review summarizes current knowledge on the bidirectional crosstalk between dysbiotic microbiota and innate immune macrophages in OSCC, highlighting key receptor-mediated pathways and their implications for immune suppression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Targeting microbiota modulation or innate immune reprogramming represents a promising strategy for restoring anti-tumor immunity and enhancing therapeutic efficacy in OSCC.">

        <tr id="The healthy intestine maintains homeostasis in part via immune responses to microbiota, which includes basal production of interferon cytokines. Previous work showed that Type III Interferon (IFN-λ) stimulates localized pockets of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the adult mouse intestinal epithelium at homeostasis that provide preemptive protection from viral pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that a major source of homeostatic IFN-λ production in the intestine is a population of epithelium-associated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). Depletion of bacterial microbiota in the intestine also reduces pDC abundance, and pDC depletion or bone marrow reconstitution with IFN-λ-deficient pDC results in reduced expression of homeostatic ISGs in the intestinal epithelium. Notably, intestinal pDC preferentially produce IFN-λ over Type I IFNs whereas splenic pDC produce more Type I IFNs. Comparison of intestinal and splenic pDC reveal tissue-specific changes in gene expression and genomic accessibility, including evidence of responses to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in the intestine. Isolated gut pDC produce more IFN-λ than splenic pDC upon stimulation, and pre-treatment of a human pDC cell line with TGF-β results in enhanced production of IFN-λ upon stimulation. This study demonstrates that pDC are an important source of homeostatic IFN-λ in the intestine and defines the role of barrier cytokine TGF-β in regulating IFN types produced by pDC upon stimulation. Reprogramming of recruited pDC by tissue cytokines may have important implications for balancing effective antimicrobial responses with damaging inflammation at barrier tissues.">

In this study, MSCs with a Y-shaped bispecific antibody (YMV) assembled via DNA nanotechnology, which integrates anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (anti-VCAM-1) and anti-mucosal addressing cell adhesion molecules-1 (anti-MAdCAM-1) antibodies are engineered, to enhance targeted delivery and inhibit leukocyte recruitment. YMV-modified MSCs show an approximately threefold enhancement in adhesion efficiency compared with native MSCs. Notably, they effectively compete for MAdCAM-1 binding sites and significantly suppress leukocyte adhesion. In a mouse model of IBD, YMV-MSCs demonstrate enhanced homing to the colon, promote mucosal repair, reduce leukocyte infiltration, and attenuate local inflammation. This DNA-mediated bispecific antibody modification strategy improves MSCs targeting and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by blocking leukocyte recruitment, offering a promising platform for MSC-based therapy.">

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is the most extensive measure calculated from complete counts of peripheral blood. Despite there was an increase in the NLR in high grade tumours of our cohorts of study, we did not find evidence of any correlation between the NLR and different degrees of tumour immune infiltration in glioblastoma. The same negative result was obtained with the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR). In addition, glioblastomas associated with extreme values of peripheral NLR did not exhibit substantial gene expression differences that could be linked to distinct tumourigenic properties. Overall, these results suggest that peripheral immune cell ratios cannot be used to reliably infer the immune microenvironment within the tumour, underscoring the complexity of using peripheral markers to assess local tumour immunity.

        <tr id="Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are DNA-protein structures released during a form of programmed neutrophil death known as NETosis. While NETs have been implicated in both tumor inhibition and promotion, their functional role in cancer remains ambiguous. In this study, we compared the NET-forming capacity and functional effects of NETs derived from lung cancer (LC) patients and healthy donors (H). Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood and stimulated in vitro with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce NETosis. Isolated NETs were quantified and assessed for their cytotoxicity against A549 lung cancer cells and their impact on cancer cell migration. Whereas LC neutrophils (LCN) were less cytotoxic to tumor cells than H neutrophils (HN), their NETs maintained similar tumoricidal capacity – 41.6% ± 25.3% (LCN) vs. 46.4% ± 14.5% (HN), ns. Interestingly, we noted a correlation between the amount of NETs and their cytotoxicity to tumor cells. This effect could not be recapitulated with purified genomic DNA, inducing only 3.99% of cytotoxicity to tumor cells, and confirming that intact NETs are required for the anti-tumor activity. LCN displayed an increased frequency of NETosis following PMA stimulation, yet produced significantly fewer NETs per cell – 1569 ± 306 ng (LCN) vs. 2619 ± 313 ng (HN); p = 0.025. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was elevated in LC neutrophils, indicating that the NETosis defect was not due to impaired oxidative burst. LCN had increased expression of immunosuppression (PDL-1) as well as exhaustion and aging markers CD62L and CD11b). Only NETs from HN inhibited the migration of A549 tumor cells, whereas those from LCN failed to suppress, and in some cases appeared to enhance, cell motility. Our data suggest that NETs in lung cancer retain anti-tumor cytotoxicity capabilities but lose their anti-migratory capacity, highlighting their dual role in tumor biology and potential as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including myasthenia gravis (MG), but their specific function in MG exacerbations remains unclear. This study utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bone marrow and peripheral blood from MG patients during acute exacerbations, combined with experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) mouse models and clinical cohort analyses, to investigate the potential involvement of a neutrophil-B-cell activating factor (BAFF) -plasma cell axis. The results reveal that, during MG acute exacerbation, bone-marrow neutrophils exhibit significantly enhanced maturation. Upon migration to the peripheral blood, these neutrophils secrete increased amounts of BAFF, further promoting pathological B-cell differentiation and plasma cell activation. Moreover, gene knockout models and serum cytokine analyses reveal that the IFN-γ signaling pathway is a key driver of this excessive BAFF secretion, supporting the existence of a neutrophil-BAFF-plasma cell interaction relevant to MG exacerbation. Clinical data analysis shows that MG patients with high baseline neutrophil levels derive greater benefit from treatment with the BAFF/APRIL dual-target inhibitor telitacicept. Collectively, this study reveals the mechanistic link between neutrophil activation and MG exacerbation, providing insights that may inform precision-targeted immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Neutrophils, constituting a predominant subset of innate immune cells in mammalian systems, play pivotal roles in pathogenic clearance and homeostatic maintenance. In the progressive development of cancer, neutrophils exert dual roles in both anticancer and procancer processes through their heterogeneity. In recent years, research into the role of neutrophils in cancer and various nontumor diseases has been continuously deepening. However, current research in this area remains incomplete. This review comprehensively summarizes the tissue homing dynamics, lifespan regulation, and physiological functions of neutrophils, starting from their development and heterogeneity. Furthermore, we delineate the dual regulatory functions of neutrophils in carcinogenesis, encompassing both tumor‐suppressive mechanisms and protumor mechanisms. This section further synthesizes recent advancements in neutrophil‐targeted therapeutic platforms and biomimetic delivery systems, while critically evaluating persistent methodological and translational challenges in clinical applications. In addition, we systematically analyze the role of neutrophils in non‐neoplastic diseases and list several typical diseases, including infectious diseases. Finally, we also discuss current controversies and research perspectives on neutrophils. It is hoped that this review will deepen insights into the role of neutrophils in homeostasis and disease, while exploring their potential in disease treatment.">

        <tr id="Endometriosis (EMs) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by dysregulated innate immunity, particularly impaired cytotoxic function of natural killer (NK) cells. As pivotal effectors of the innate immune response, NK cells fail to eliminate ectopic endometrial lesions due to aberrant receptor–ligand interactions, elevated levels of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10), and dysfunction of adhesion molecules. This compromised immune surveillance facilitates the survival and implantation of ectopic lesions, contributing to the hallmark symptoms of pain and infertility. Recent immunotherapeutic strategies, including NK cell checkpoint blockade (anti-NKG2A, anti-PD-1), IL-2-based activation, and adoptive NK cell transfer—seek to restore NK cell cytotoxicity and reestablish immune homeostasis. This review summarizes current advances in understanding NK cell dysfunction in EMs, emphasizing its central role in immune evasion and the therapeutic promise of targeting innate immune pathways.">

        <tr id="Nanographene oxide (NGO) exhibits immunomodulatory activity and holds promise as a therapeutic agent for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In a xenogeneic GVHD mouse model, NGO administration improves survival and attenuates pathology with reduced weight loss and leukocyte engraftment, without sustained systemic toxicity. In GVHD patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), NGO treatment shifts T cell subsets toward immune homeostasis by increasing naïve T cells and decreasing effector memory T cells. Integrated transcriptomic analyses of PBMCs from GVHD patients and healthy donors reveal downregulation of pro-inflammatory and interferon-gamma-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (IFN-γ-STAT1)-associated genes, coinciding with the suppression of M1 macrophage signatures and induction of anti-inflammatory profiles. Mechanistically, NGO inhibits STAT1 activation and biases macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory state, independent of reactive oxygen species scavenging and lipopolysaccharide-myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (LPS-MyD88) signaling. To improve translational feasibility, NGO-primed macrophages (NGO-Mac) are generated, which produce higher levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), inhibit helper T cell 1 (Th1) differentiation, and promote regulatory T cell (Treg) induction in an IL-10-dependent manner. In vivo, NGO-Mac therapy reduces M1 macrophage infiltration, increases Treg frequencies, and attenuates GVHD pathology. These findings highlight NGO and NGO-Mac as complementary immunotherapies, while further studies on safety, biodistribution, and feasibility are necessary for translation.">

 CD8 T cells are effector cells of the adaptive immune system responsible for mediating protective immune responses in cancer. However, CD8 T cells can also be critical drivers of pathologic responses including autoimmunity. A key feature of these cells is that they must infiltrate tissues to execute their primary function of cell killing. It is well established that naive T cell responses do not originate in these tissues. Rather, prior to antigen-driven activation, naïve T cells are restricted to lymph nodes, spleen, and blood. T cell activation by cognate antigen drives expression of multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors, including programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and/or cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), as well as migration to nonlymphoid tissues. Work over the last two decades has harnessed T cell effector activities by blocking PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, which has revolutionized cancer care and demonstrated remarkable efficacy in diverse cancer types. However, many patients do not respond to checkpoint blockade therapy, and worse, other patients develop autoimmune-like immune-related adverse events (irAEs), limiting the utility of this approach. To maximize the therapeutic benefit of checkpoint blockade without accelerated irAE development, targeted approaches are needed to increase recruitment of protective CD8 T cells to tumors while preventing pathogenic T cell entry into sensitive tissues. However, an inability to granularly measure recruitment into non-lymphoid tissues has created a significant gap in knowledge in: 1) how checkpoint inhibitors impact T cell entry rates into tissues, 2) whether these entry rates are different for tumors and lesional irAE tissues, 3) where recruited cells localize, and 4) the precise functional contributions of recruited versus resident T cells in driving tumor regression or autoimmunity. To fill this gap in knowledge, we are utilizing an intravenous antibody labeling approach to mark CD8 T cells in the blood prior to entry into tissues, an approach which enables a 72-hour window to track tissue entry. Using this approach in the preclinical setting, we are interrogating how PD-1 inhibitors impact CD8 T cell recruitment to tumors as well as the pancreas in the context of Type 1 Diabetes. In our tumor studies, we have found that PD-1 inhibitors induce an increase in the number of recently recruited CD8 T cells, and that these recruited T cells have a less exhausted phenotype than the T cells that have been in the tumor for longer. In our diabetes studies, we have found that PD-1 inhibitors impact CD8 T cells both in the periphery and the pancreas, and in some mice cause an increase in migration to the pancreas. These studies support a model where peripheral CD8 T cell recruitment can positively contribute to productive anti-tumor immunity but can also exacerbate autoimmunity. Thus, our studies emphasize the doubled-edged nature of T cell recruitment, and our future studies will examine ways to both improve recruitment to tumors and mitigate recruitment to lesional irAE tissues.

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapies (ACTs) have revolutionized cancer treatment by harnessing the specificity and potency of T lymphocytes. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have achieved landmark successes in B-cell malignancies and multiple myeloma. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells offer complementary strategies to target solid tumors and intracellular antigens. Despite these advances, ACTs face challenges including cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, on-target/off-tumor effects, manufacturing scalability, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Innovative strategies, such as dual-antigen targeting, localized delivery, checkpoint blockade combinations, gene-editing, and machine-learning-guided antigen discovery, are being used to mitigate toxicity, enhance efficacy, and streamline production. As CAR-T, TIL, and TCR modalities converge with advances in manufacturing and computational biology, the next generation of “living drugs” promises broader applicability across hematologic and solid tumors, improved safety profiles, and better treatment outcomes for patients. This review details the evolution of ACTs from first-generation CAR constructs to next-generation “armored” designs. It also focuses on the development and clinical deployment of TIL and TCR therapies. Furthermore, it synthesizes mechanisms, pivotal clinical trial outcomes, and ongoing challenges of ACTs. It also highlights strategies that will drive broader, safer, and more durable applications of these therapies across hematologic and solid tumors.">

In our study, we identified a lactate-based chemical barrier surrounding FAP+ cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the LUAD microenvironment (TME), which may hinder the infiltration and function of CD8+ T cells. Further investigation revealed that FAP+ CAFs specifically overexpress LINC01711, which drives lactate production by promoting FGFR1-mediated phosphorylation of lactic dehydrogenase A (LDHA) at the Y10 site and facilitating the formation of active LDHA tetramers. These FAP+ CAFs then export lactate into TME via the MCT4 transporter, thereby establishing a chemical barrier and fostering an immunosuppressive TME. Notably, we developed a small extracellular vesicle (sEV)-based in vivo self-assembled siRNA system for in vivo knockdown of LINC01711 and demonstrated its potential to enhance the response rate to ICIs in LUAD. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of FAP+ CAFs in driving resistance to ICIs and propose novel therapeutic strategies to overcome this obstacle.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), derived from circulating monocytes recruited to tumor sites via chemotactic signals such as C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functionally polarized into distinct subtypes, TAMs play dual roles: proinflammatory M1-type TAMs enhance antitumor immunity through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. This polarization is dynamically regulated by different cytokines, various signaling pathways, and metabolic cues within the TME. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that M2-like TAMs predominantly infiltrate hypoxic and stromal regions, where they secrete factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to remodel the extracellular matrix and suppress immune responses via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and arginase-1 upregulation. Crucially, TAMs interact extensively with immune cells; M2-TAMs secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TGF-β to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes while expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells and impairing natural killer (NK) cell function via altered antigen presentation. Conversely, M1-TAMs synergize with dendritic cells to enhance T-cell priming. Therapeutically, targeting TAMs offers promising strategies, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, CCL2 antagonists, and nanoparticle-mediated repolarization of M2-TAMs toward the M1 phenotype. Emerging genetic approaches, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) editing, aim to disrupt protumorigenic pathways in TAMs. Additionally, TAM-related biomarkers (e.g., CD206 and CD163) are being evaluated for their prognostic and predictive utility in immunotherapies. Despite progress, challenges persist owing to TAM plasticity and TME heterogeneity across cancers. This review synthesizes TAM biology, immune crosstalk, and therapeutic advancements, providing a foundation for novel oncology strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to overcome treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that significantly endangers human health and hampers social development. The accumulation of eggs in the liver can lead to granuloma formation and liver fibrosis. Investigating the immune mechanisms involved may reveal new therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis. Methods: We collected liver cells from both schistosome-infected mice with fibrotic livers and healthy mice for single-cell sequencing, which allowed us to explore the heterogeneity of immune cells in the fibrotic livers and to use ligand-receptor analysis to examine intercellular communication. Results: Single-cell sequencing showed significant upregulation of the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis in the fibrotic livers of schistosome-infected mice. Macrophages were the primary source of CXCL16, while CXCR6 was predominantly expressed in T cells. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased in the livers of schistosomiasis, as well as CXCR6 in CD4+T cells and CD8+ T cells. Among different T-cell subsets, Th2 cells primarily expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR6. In CXCR6KO mice, we observed a reduced granuloma area and diminished liver fibrosis. CD4+ T cells were notably lower in the livers of CXCR6KO mice compared to wild-type mice, although there were no significant differences in CD8+ T cells and NKT cells. Furthermore, Th2 cells in the livers of CXCR6KO mice were markedly reduced, along with significant decreases in IL-13, IL-5, and IL-4 levels. In vitro, CXCR6 was significantly upregulated under Th2-polarizing conditions. Conclusions: Th2 cells are recruited to the liver via the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis, promoting granuloma formation and liver fibrosis in schistosomiasis. The CXCR6 pathway holds potential as a therapeutic target for treating schistosome-associated liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TRIM) is a form of long-lasting functional reprogramming of innate immune cells and their progenitors that enhances responsiveness to subsequent stimuli. Although first characterized in myeloid cells, TRIM was recently extended to nonmyeloid cell types, including endothelial and glial cells, which also exhibit stimulus-driven, memory-like behavior. While initially recognized as a protective mechanism, particularly in the context of vaccines and acute infections, TRIM can also become maladaptive, promoting chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and disease. This Review focuses on virus-induced TRIM while also addressing microbial, metabolic, and endogenous inducers. We examine key ligands and receptors that initiate TRIM and dissect the associated signaling and epigenetic pathways. Importantly, we argue that maladaptive TRIM arises not from a specific ligand, receptor, or molecular event, but from contextual factors such as stimulus persistence, dose, tissue microenvironment, and preexisting inflammation. The nature of the secondary challenge also shapes whether a trained response is adaptive or maladaptive. We further discuss TRIM induction in the bone marrow, involvement of both myeloid and nonmyeloid cells, and the role of lipid rafts in sustaining TRIM. We review maladaptive TRIM’s potential contribution to systemic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, sepsis, cancer, and autoimmunity, along with its influence on viral vaccine responses. Finally, we outline potential strategies to redirect maladaptive TRIM and propose key outstanding questions for future research.">

These discoveries have sparked growing interest in therapeutically targeting myeloid cells as a next generation strategy in cancer immunotherapy. As a complementary or alternative approach to T cell-centered immunotherapies, myeloid-directed therapies offer unique opportunities to reprogram the immune landscape, enhance antitumor responses, and overcome resistance mechanisms. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries in myeloid cell biology in cancer and discuss emerging therapeutic targets, with an emphasis on antibody-based therapies that have reached clinical development. We further provide perspective on translational challenges to implement these approaches into the clinic, and discuss how Fc-engineering and rational antibody design can optimize myeloid cell engagement and amplify their immune effector functions.

 Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases. This small CD4+CD25+CD127lo T cell population develops in the thymus and peripheral tissues through expression of the epigenetically stabilized transcription factor FOXP3. Tregs mediate their tolerogenic effects via multiple mechanisms, including secretion of inhibitory cytokines, IL-2 consumption to starve effector T cells, suppression of Teff cells through metabolic disruption, and modulation of antigen-presenting cell maturation and function. Collectively, these mechanisms broadly suppress immune cell activation and effector function. Additionally, Tregs can promote tissue repair, complementing their immunosuppressive effects. Recent advances have focused on harnessing Tregs as a therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases, aiming to restore immune tolerance and repair tissue damage. A key to therapeutic success lies in developing a stable Treg product that preserves functional activity and lineage integrity under inflammatory conditions. Previous studies have shown that polyclonal Tregs can be administered safely to patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases. The cells can be detected in the circulation at least one year after administration and in small studies the cells have been shown to suppress inflammatory cytokines produced by effector T cells.
 In this presentation, I will highlight the differences between blood Tregs and the synovial microenvironment in the joints of healthy donors versus patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Additionally, I will present early preclinical and clinical data on our first engineered product, SBT-77-7101, which expresses a citrullinated protein (CitP)-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) derived from a RA patient-specific anti-citrullinated protein antibody. These CitP CAR-Tregs retain stable phenotypic and epigenetic profiles, remain functional in inflammatory environments, recognize multiple citrullinated proteins present in diseased tissue, and are activated by synovial fluid from patients with RA. Clinical studies of SBT-77-7101 in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa will be summarized. Finally, next-generation Treg engineering strategies aimed at enhancing Treg durability and specificity will be presented including approaches to maximize Treg stability via genome editing and develop synthetic FOXP3-dependent promoters to ensure controlled CAR expression.

        <tr id="Objectives Dendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal antigen-presenting cells capable of bridging innate and adaptive immunity, making them promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. While canine mature DCs (cmDCs) have been successfully generated from circulating mononuclear cells (CMCs) in healthy dogs, their derivation and immunomodulatory capacity in tumor-bearing dogs (TbDs) remain poorly characterized. Methods In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of cmDC generation from peripheral blood of both healthy donors (HDs) and TbDs and investigated their functional responses to Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and mRNA-based genetic modification. Results CD14+ monocytes were successfully isolated from peripheral blood using immunomagnetic sorting and differentiated into cmDCs using recombinant canine GM-CSF and IL-4. The differentiation efficiency was comparable between the two groups. In both cohorts, cmDCs upregulated key maturation markers (CD1a, CD80, CD83) and restored DLA class II expression in TbDs. Stimulation with LPS and R848 significantly increased CD80 and CD83 expression and triggered IL-12/p70 and IL-8 production, confirming the acquisition of a functional immunostimulatory phenotype. To assess their amenability to genetic engineering, cmDCs were transfected using DE-DOPE/mRNA lipoplexes. These lipoplexes exhibited favorable physicochemical properties and achieved robust mRNA delivery, resulting in 100% GFP-positive cells and >60% viability, outperforming electroporation in terms of cytocompatibility. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that cmDCs derived from both HDs and TbDs are phenotypically and functionally competent and can be efficiently transfected using a non-viral mRNA delivery system. This strategy offers a viable platform for the development of personalized, DC-based cancer vaccines in canine patients.">

 The dynamic evolution of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) during targeted therapy is a critical yet poorly understood determinant of treatment response and resistance. While most studies compare immune states before and after treatment, temporal immune changes during therapy remain largely uncharacterized, limiting development of effective combination strategies. Here, we investigated immune dynamics throughout targeted therapy using mouse melanoma models that recapitulate human therapeutic responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified an inflection point where the inflamed TME during tumor regression, characterized by robust NK cell infiltration, transitions to an immune-excluded state upon onset of drug-tolerant residual disease. We uncovered a unique macrophage subset that orchestrates NK cell recruitment during regression. Depletion of these macrophages using LysM-cre;iDTR mice significantly reduced NK cell infiltration. Extending these findings to human cancer, longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of melanoma and lung cancer patient samples revealed dynamic NK cell infiltration during targeted therapy, establishing a direct link between innate immune remodeling and treatment outcome. Unlike prior prognostic studies assessing immune states at single time points, our results provide mechanistic evidence of a temporal relationship between NK cell infiltration and therapeutic efficacy. Together, these findings position immune evolution as a driver of acquired resistance and identify macrophage–NK cell crosstalk as a therapeutically actionable axis to overcome immune exclusion and improve targeted therapy.

        <tr id="Background: CLEC5A is a C-type lectin expressed by monocytes and neutrophils, playing an important role in innate immunity. Although it has been shown to interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, its role during vaccination remains poorly understood. Methods: To address this question, we combined in vitro assays to characterize CLEC5A and spike expression and their impact on monocyte differentiation and T-cell activation; in vivo studies to evaluate CLEC5A expression, immune responses, and vaccine efficacy in a murine model; and in silico analyses to identify potential spike epitopes and CLEC5A interaction sites. Results: The Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent mRNA vaccine induced spike expression and CLEC5A upregulation in THP-1 monocytes, promoting M1-like differentiation and CD86+ activation. In PBMC co-cultures, CLEC5A+ monocytes acted as antigen-presenting cells, releasing inflammatory chemokines and activating both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, thereby linking CLEC5A expression to adaptive immunity. In mice, CLEC5A expression was observed on inflammatory monocytes (CCR2+CX3CR1low) within two days of vaccination. In vivo, CLEC5A expression increased during SARS-CoV-2 infection and after immunization, but declined following viral challenge in vaccinated animals. Consistently, robust humoral and cellular responses were detected post-immunization. In silico analysis further suggested differential CLEC5A binding across B- and T-cell epitopes within the spike glycoprotein. Conclusions: These findings suggest that CLEC5A may play a role in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Although further studies with different vaccine platforms are necessary to confirm and expand these observations, our results provide preliminary evidence supporting the potential of CLEC5A as an exploratory biomarker of vaccine-induced immunity.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate infected or malignant cells, safeguarding surrounding tissues. Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response, the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast the T-cell response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation, proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. By exploring a broad class of feedback-controller designs as potential immune programs, we demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different immune signals. Notably, we find that designs that balance harm from acute infections and autoimmunity produce immune responses consistent with experimentally observed patterns of T-cell effector expansion in mice. Extending our model to immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the affinity for tumor antigens ("quality") and the abundance ("quantity") of infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment. Finally, we show how therapeutic efficacy can be improved by targeted genetic perturbations to T-cells. Our findings offer a unified control-logic for cytotoxic T-cell responses and point to specific regulatory programs that can be engineered for more robust T-cell therapies.">

        <tr id="Myeloid cells play critical roles as Fc effector cells in antibody-mediated immunity. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes the recruitment and activation of multiple myeloid populations and has been used in combination with vaccines/treatments against infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions and cancers. To evaluate GM-CSF-mediated kinetics of immune cell expansion and immune outcomes, we compared subcutaneous (subQ) and topical hypoosmolar (intravaginal/intrarectal) administration in vivo using rhesus macaques (RM), as they provide easy access to longitudinal mucosal tissue sampling and are a critical model species for vaccines/therapeutics development. While topical GM-CSF did not result in a major change, neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes were elevated within 1-3 days of subQ GM-CSF administration, with peak eosinophil and neutrophil enrichment in blood at days 7 and 8, respectively. Corresponding elevations of neutrophils, eosinophils, total CD64+ and total CD32+ were observed at days 7 and 14 in rectal biopsies, indicating general Fc effector cell accumulation in these animals. Histological evaluations of vaginal biopsies showed myeloid cell infiltration at day 14 of subQ GM-CSF treatment. Further, subQ GM-CSF administration resulted in myeloid cell activation and trafficking, as evidenced by elevated levels of cytokines (CXCL13, MCP-1, IL-1RA). Importantly, neither subQ nor topical GM-CSF administration induced overt systemic inflammation or adverse clinical impacts. Overall, our findings delineate the kinetics of systemic and mucosal myeloid cell expansion, activation and trafficking achieved by subQ GM-CSF administration in RM. These findings will inform the use of GM-CSF as an adjuvant in clinical applications where myeloid cell mobilization is advantageous.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a critical factor contributing to secondary brain injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This process engages diverse cell types within the central nervous system (CNS), including significant infiltration of myeloid lineage cells–primarily neutrophils and macrophages–during the acute and subacute phases of TBI. These myeloid-derived cells represent a major population that critically influences the development and progression of neuroinflammation. Microglia and peripherally infiltrating macrophages exhibit polarization phenotypes that play a pivotal role in modulating inflammatory changes. Due to their functional and phenotypic similarities, their distinct contributions to the inflammatory response in TBI remain a subject of considerable debate. Lysozyme 2 (Lyz2) is a well-established marker for myeloid lineage cells (including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) in mice, allowing specific targeting and depletion of these cells to dissect their functional roles in TBI.In the present study, we investigated the trend of inflammatory factors during the early stage of TBI using Lyz2-IRES-DTREGFP transgenic mice, which specifically target and deplete Lyz2-positive myeloid cells. Tissue samples for RT-qPCR and flow cytometry were harvested from the perilesional cortex (within a 2-mm radius of the impact site) and the underlying hippocampus.Our findings revealed a considerable reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-1β, iNOS, IL-6, IFN-γ) and an increase in the expression of anti-inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, Arg-1). Furthermore, we observed a shift in polarization phenotypes, characterized by a decreased proportion of M1 macrophages and an increased proportion of M2 macrophages. However, during the chronic phase, behavioral and histological analyses revealed worse outcomes. These findings demonstrate that targeted depletion of Lyz2-positive myeloid cells during acute TBI attenuates neuroinflammation. However, this early immunomodulatory shift correlates paradoxically with exacerbated chronic neurological deficits, suggesting that transient suppression of myeloid-driven inflammation may disrupt long-term reparative processes critical for functional recovery after TBI.">

        <tr id="Plasticity of myeloid cells, characterized by their ability to undergo reprogramming in response to environmental cues, is a fundamental feature enabling their versatile functions during immune responses. Macrophages and neutrophils, the primary myeloid cell types, exhibit distinct polarization states. Classical polarization states of macrophages and neutrophils are associated with antimicrobial activity, inflammation promotion, and tissue remodeling. Pathological polarization, observed in chronic inflammation, cancer, and other conditions, is marked by enhanced immune-suppressive activity, aberrant enzymatic activity, and atypical cytokine production, diverging from their classical functions. This review delves into the most up-to-date characterization of those polarization states, the transcriptional and epigenetic factors, and the metabolic pathways governing myeloid cell reprogramming, highlighting the influence of cytokines and tissue-specific conditions, such as hypoxia in tumors, on this process. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathological polarization of myeloid cells offers a promising avenue to modulate their activity for targeted therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic immune-mediated fibroinflammatory disorder characterized by dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and storiform fibrosis, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Although glucocorticoids provide initial clinical improvement, relapse is common, underscoring the need for targeted therapies. B-cell depletion therapy has emerged as a promising approach, shedding light on the roles of plasmablasts and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in disease pathogenesis.


AREAS COVERED
This review summarizes recent advances in immunological mechanisms of IgG4-RD, focusing on plasmablasts, activated B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, other immune cells, and fibroblasts. We highlight how single-cell RNA sequencing and highly multiplex immunofluorescence have uncovered novel immune subsets and their interactions. These technologies have identified previously unrecognized populations, including GZMK+ cytotoxic Tfh cells, MKI67+ B cells, and double-negative type 3 B cells, offering unprecedented resolution into disease mechanisms.


EXPERT OPINION
Single-cell technologies have revolutionized our understanding of IgG4-RD immunopathogenesis and potentially revealed disease heterogeneity across clinical phenotypes. These insights hold promise for biomarker development and precision therapeutic strategies. Future directions should include spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, improved animal models, and translational efforts to bridge mechanistic discoveries with targeted treatment for this complex multi-organ disease.">

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) disproportionately affects Black women, who face higher rates of aggressive disease and poorer outcomes. While tumor-intrinsic features have been studied, less is known about how immune surveillance and lymph node (LN) architecture differ by ethnicity. Anti-tumor immune responses typically begin in LNs through antigen presentation to naïve immune cells and executed by effector cells that circulate to and infiltrate tumors. We hypothesized that Black and White TNBC patients exhibit divergent immune signatures across both compartments. We first analyzed a retrospective cohort of 116 White, and 51 Black early-stage TNBC patients. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were extracted to assess systemic immune status. Black patients showed lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; median 1.61 vs 2.71, p<0.0001), consistent with ancestry-associated benign neutropenia. We next prospectively profiled immune signatures in early-stage TNBC patients. PBMCs from 55 patients (38 White, 17 Black) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Serum from 33 patients (20 White, 13 Black) was profiled using Olink proteomics, and 12 PBMCs by LC-MS. Immune profiling revealed coordinated alterations in both effector and antigen-presenting cell compartments (all padj<0.05). Black patients had increased NK cells, particularly within the cytotoxic CD56dim and NKG2D+ subsets, and elevated dendritic cells skewed toward cross-presenting cDC1 subset. CD8+ T cells displayed reduced PD-1 expression and increased frequencies of both TEMRA and NKG2D+ subsets, suggesting enhanced cytotoxic potential. Circulating CD4+ central memory T cells were reduced, while CXCR5+CD4+ and CD8+ CM cells were elevated, potentially reflecting altered LN trafficking in black patients. Serum analysis showed elevated CXCL1/3 and TNF-α/NFκB signaling. LC-MS proteomics further indicated a shift toward oxidative phosphorylation in Black patients, suggesting distinct metabolic programming that may influence effector function. To examine immune architecture, we analyzed H&E from 736 LNs (110 patients) and CD3/CD20 IHC from 414 LNs (90 patients). LN architecture was preserved across groups, but Black patients exhibited greater CD20+ B cell presence in uninvolved nodes, consistent with enriched germinal center-like features. CD3+ cells were higher in involved nodes of White patients (p<0.05). A subset of 26 LNs (15 White, 11 Black) underwent 21-plex PhenoCycler analysis (∼12M cells). In uninvolved LNs, CD20+ zones in White patients had more CD8+ T cells, while Black patients had more naïve B cells and FDC-associated B cells. In involved LNs, White patients showed more CD8+ infiltration, while Black patients had fewer tumor–CD8+ contacts and more FOXP3+CD8+cells. These findings reveal ethnicity-linked divergence in immune surveillance, with Black patients displaying altered clinical indices, enhanced circulating effector features, but reduced CD8+ cytotoxic engagement in tumor-involved LNs. These systemic and spatial patterns may contribute to TNBC outcome disparities.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a serious condition where cancer spreads throughout the lining of the abdominal cavity. It often occurs in late stages of cancers like ovarian, colon, or stomach cancer and is hard to treat. Patients with PC usually suffer from complications such as fluid buildup (ascites), bowel blockages, and poor nutrition, which severely impact quality of life and limit treatment options. This review focuses on a molecule called interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is part of the body’s immune system but also helps cancers grow and spread. IL-8 attracts immune cells like neutrophils that, instead of fighting the cancer, create an environment through its receptor CXCR1/CXCR2 signaling that helps tumors survive, invade new areas, and avoid immune attack. IL-8 also encourages inflammation, blood vessel growth to feed tumors, and scar tissue buildup that causes bowel obstruction. Blocking IL-8—either with specific antibodies or drugs that stop its action—has shown promise in early lab studies and clinical trials. These treatments may help reduce cancer spread, ease symptoms like ascites, and improve how well other cancer therapies work. Our review concludes that targeting IL-8 and its receptor CXCR1/CXCR2 is a promising new strategy for treating peritoneal carcinomatosis and could improve survival and quality of life for patients. More research is needed to confirm its benefits and develop combination treatments.">

        <tr id="T-cell receptor (TCR) bispecific proteins represent a pioneering therapeutic modality that harnesses the diverse target recognition capabilities inherent to TCRs while preserving the beneficial characteristics associated with protein therapeutics. However, investigations into TCR bispecific proteins, particularly within the context of lung diseases, remain limited. This study aims to elucidate their potential for the treatment of lung cancer. We employed a humanized murine model to evaluate the efficacy of TCR bispecific proteins in eradicating lung tumors in vivo. Cytotoxic activity was assessed against various lung cancer cell lines, and statistical tests were used to analyze the data. To address concerns regarding toxic side effects from systemic administration, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were explored as vehicles for the targeted delivery of TCR bispecific proteins. Our findings demonstrate that TCR bispecific proteins exhibit substantial cytotoxic activity against a variety of lung cancer cell lines. MSCs, with optimal pulmonary targeting properties, were shown to persist within the lungs for over 7 days. By employing MSCs to locally secrete TCR bispecific proteins, we achieved therapeutic effects comparable to systemic administration without manifestations of immune overactivation in murine subjects. Additionally, we evaluated various cytokine combinations and discovered that the combination of IL-7, IL-21, and TCR bispecific proteins significantly augmented their capacity to eliminate antigen-negative cells in a heterogeneous tumor model. Collectively, our findings suggest that the combinatorial therapy of TCR bispecific proteins and MSCs holds considerable promise for clinical application in the treatment of lung cancer, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Despite the clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), patient outcomes vary even among those with identical EGFR mutations. This study investigates whether osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, activates the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in macrophages to drive antitumor immunity and explores its mechanistic basis. Methods Using bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type and gene-deficient mice, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and a Lewis lung cancer murine model, we assessed osimertinib-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, interleukin (IL)-1β secretion, pyroptosis, and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling. Mechanistic studies evaluated lysosomal dysfunction, calcium overload, mitochondrial damage, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Clinical correlations were analyzed in patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs. Results Osimertinib triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages via lysosomal dysfunction-induced calcium overload, leading to mitochondrial damage and ROS production, which acted as damage-associated molecular patterns to activate NLRP3. This process promoted IL-1β release, pyroptosis, and CD8+ T-cell activation while suppressing regulatory T cells in the TME. In murine models, osimertinib’s antitumor effects were abrogated by NLRP3 inhibition (MCC950) and enhanced by recombinant IL-1β (rIL-1β) co-administration (p<0.01). Clinically, high NLRP3 and IL-1β expression in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) correlated with prolonged progression-free survival (p<0.01) and overall survival (p<0.01) in EGFR-TKI-treated patients with NSCLC. Conclusions Osimertinib exerts off-target immunomodulatory effects by activating the tumor-extrinsic NLRP3 inflammasome, linking mitochondrial-lysosomal crosstalk to antitumor immunity. NLRP3 and IL-1β in TAMs emerge as predictive biomarkers for EGFR-TKI efficacy, while rIL-1β combination therapy represents a novel strategy to enhance clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Chronic inflammation supports tissue repair while inadvertently promoting carcinogenesis. Cytokines - critical immune system-signaling molecules - mediate the inflammatory response and establish a cancer-conducive microenvironment. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β, are frequently overexpressed in chronic inflammation and facilitate tumor progression through cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-10) suppress immune surveillance, which predisposes to tumor growth. Chronic inflammation-induced dysregulation of cytokine networks induces sustained transcriptional factor activation (e.g., nuclear factor-kappa B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) that orchestrate gene expression for cell survival and immune evasion. Cytokines influence immune cell recruitment and polarization for immunosuppression and tumor promotion. Emerging evidence highlights the role of cytokines in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a key process in metastasis. Targeting the cytokine-signaling pathway constitutes a promising cancer treatment option. Monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule cytokine inhibitors and their receptors could mitigate tumor-promoting inflammation. Understanding the complex interplay among chronic inflammation, cytokines, and cancer progression is critical for identifying biomarkers and developing targeted therapies to improve clinical outcomes. This review underscores the significance of cytokines in the chronic inflammation-cancer linkage and as potential therapeutic targets. Further research is essential to elucidate intricate cytokine mechanisms in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment for clinical interventions.">

Ad priming elicited robust type I interferon (IFN)-mediated innate-like T cell activation, augmenting T cell responses (innate-to-adaptive signaling), which was dampened at boost by antivector immunity. Conversely, mRNA boosting enhanced innate-like responses, driven by prime-induced spike-specific memory T cell-derived IFN-γ (adaptive-to-innate signaling). Extending the dosing interval dampened inflammation at boost because of waning T cell memory. In a separate vaccine trial, preboost spike-specific T cells predicted severe mRNA reactogenicity regardless of the priming platform or interval. Overall, bidirectional innate-like and adaptive cross-talk, and IFN-γ-licensed innate-like T cells, orchestrate interval-dependent early vaccine responses, suggesting modifiable targets for safer, more effective regimens.">

We initiated a phase I trial (NCT06017258), successfully manufactured and administered CD371/SAVVY/IL-18 CAR T-cells in 5 patients with relapsed/refractory AML and observed expansion following a single infusion of 3x104 or 3x105 CAR T-cells/kg; three patients refractory to ≥5 lines of therapy and post-allogeneic transplant exhibited AML clearance and no evidence of graft-versus-host disease. Dose-limiting toxicity in the two patients treated with 3x105 CAR T-cells/kg dose (prolonged cytopenias with marrow hypoplasia; severe cytokine release syndrome) led to dose reduction to 3x104 CAR T-cells/kg in the following three patients. Single-cell analyses revealed that circulating CAR T-cells in responders included predominantly cytotoxic CD8+ effector T-cells 2 weeks post-infusion while co-existing NK-cells expressed markers of activation.

Cancer’s ability to manipulate the immune system through tumor-induced immunosuppression
remains a significant challenge in oncology. The tumor microenvironment (TME)
employs various mechanisms, including the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, the secretion
of inhibitory cytokines, and metabolic reprogramming, to evade immune responses and
impair immunotherapies. Natural killer (NK) cells, a vital component of innate immunity, exhibit
potent anti-tumor activity. However, their function is often suppressed within the TME.
Recent advancements in genetic engineering have enabled the development of modified NK
cells with enhanced persistence, targeting, and cytotoxicity. Strategies such as chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR)-NK cells, cytokine engineering, immune checkpoint blockade, and resistance to

        <tr id="Simple Summary Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown significant success in treating hematological cancers, but commercialized autologous CAR-T therapies face challenges such as high costs, manufacturing delays, complex standardization and the risk of tumor relapses due to single-antigen targeting. To address these issues, a novel allogeneic CAR-T therapy with broader target specificity was developed, optimizing its manufacturing process. Using CRISPR/Cas9, TCR and HLA class I complex expression were eliminated from donor T cells to reduce the risk of immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Additionally, NKG2D CAR, targeting eight ligands upregulated in both solid and hematological tumors, was lentivirally transduced. This study optimized CAR-T cell manufacture by testing various interleukin supplements (IL-2, IL-7/IL-15, IL-7/IL-15/IL-21). Results showed that IL-7/IL-15/IL-21 supplementation produced CAR-T cells with the most suitable characteristics in terms of genetic modification efficiency, cell proliferation, antitumor activity and memory profile. This new allogeneic NKG2D CAR-T therapy represents a promising universal treatment for a variety of cancers.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a common and potentially severe complication of cancer immunotherapy, including CAR T‐cell therapies, bispecific T‐cell engagers, and less commonly immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although extensive research has established guidelines for managing CRS in hematological malignancies, there is a growing need to address CRS in the context of solid organ tumors due to differences in tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy indications, and patient population. This review aims to provide an overview of CRS in solid tumors, outlining its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and current management strategies. The complexities of CRS in solid tumors arise from challenges such as the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment and the overlap of tumor‐associated antigens with healthy tissues, potentially increasing the risk of severe on‐target off‐tumor toxicities. The review emphasizes early detection and grading of CRS as essential for patient safety and effective intervention. Management of CRS involves supportive care for mild cases, whereas severe presentations often require targeted therapies like tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and escalation to the intensive care unit for organ support. The decision to rechallenge or withhold immunotherapy requires careful consideration of patient‐specific goals and risks. Emerging treatments such as other cytokine inhibitors, plasma exchange, and suicide gene systems are promising avenues for mitigating severe CRS. Future research focuses on refining risk stratification tools, novel therapeutic agents, and evaluating long‐term outcomes. A deeper understanding of CRS in solid tumors will enable more personalized treatment approaches, enhancing the safety and efficacy of immunotherapies for this patient population.">

Strategies that evade immune clearance while modulating host immune components offer promising solutions for treating complex chronic diseases, such as fibrosis. Here, an innate immune checkpoint material-based strategy is presented in which mesenchymal stromal cells, coated with a soft conformal microgel and functionalized with the CD47 self-marker agonist, effectively evade clearance by tissue resident macrophages. These engineered cells reverse persistent fibrotic damage in the lungs through a paracrine mechanism. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies a transitional antigen-presenting macrophage subpopulation that mediates these reparative effects. By combining immune cloaking with the presentation of local signals encoded in the gel coatings, this strategy can be used to design secretory cells for long-term tissue remodeling, enabling a living pharmacy for chronic tissue damage.">

        <tr id="The short lifespan of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in vitro poses challenges, as their limited viability restricts functional assays and experimental manipulations. The HL-60 cell line serves as a valuable model for neutrophil-like differentiation, yet the functional relevance of ATRA- and DMSO-induced differentiation remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the differentiation potential of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on HL-60 cells and compare their functionality with primary PMNs. Besides that, we performed profound immunophenotypes of the cells with multicolor cytometry, and evaluated their antitumor capabilities. Our findings indicate that both differentiation conditions yield cells resembling immature neutrophils, exhibiting promyelocyte-like morphology, lacking key maturity markers. However, ATRA-differentiated cells exhibit a more mature phenotype, with higher expression of C/EBPα and reduced proliferation rates, indicating advanced differentiation. Functionally, ATRA-dHL-60 cells displayed limited immune responses, showing minimal phagocytic activity, low ROS production, and a reduced response to LPS. In contrast, DMSO-dHL-60 cells, despite their less mature phenotype, showed enhanced NET formation, and tumor-promoting potential. Additionally, DMSO-dHL-60 cells demonstrated superior adhesion and migration abilities, likely due to increased expression of CD18 and CD31. Overall, different differentiation conditions shape the functional specialization of HL-60 cells, with ATRA promoting a more neutrophil-like maturation and moderate activation, while DMSO results in a more immature phenotype with enhanced NET formation. These distinct properties suggest that ATRA-dHL-60 cells may better model neutrophils in chronic inflammation, whereas DMSO-dHL-60 cells could be more suitable for studying NETosis-driven autoimmune, thrombotic disorders and cancer.">

        <tr id="Based on previous studies on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells in patients with primary membranous nephropathy (PMN), we successfully established a murine PMN model to investigate the relationship between MDSCs, T cells, and disease progression. Our study demonstrated that MDSCs and their subclasses, as well as Th17 and T helper 2 (Th2) immune responses, were enhanced. In contrast, the proportion of T helper 1 (Th1) and regulatory T (Treg) cells decreased with PMN progression. Depletion of MDSCs with gemcitabine reduced the proportion of Th17 and Th2 cells and the expression of related transcription factors. Conversely, the proportions of Th1 and Treg cells increased in the circulation, spleen, lymph nodes, and kidneys, alleviating the clinical manifestations and pathological damage to the renal tissue in PMN model mice. These findings suggest that MDSCs, along with Th17 and Th2 responses, play critical roles in PMN progression. MDSCs may contribute to disease progression by regulating the differentiation and immune response of T-cell subclasses. The data provide new insights into the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of membranous nephropathy.">

 There is an unmet medical need for more effective therapies against glioblastoma. Cellular immunotherapies with engineered immune cells expressing synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) to recognize and attack cancer cells have great therapeutic potential. However, current strategies focus on single immune cell types, mostly T cells, followed by NK cells and face significant barriers that impede the breakthrough and wide implementation of these treatment strategies. These include long and costly production processes, complex infrastructure requirements and limited activity. Here, we developed and characterized a novel electroporation-based engineering platform to equip peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with multi-targeting CARs and pro-inflammatory cytokines (CAR-PBMC platform) rapidly within a few hours to redirect multiple immune cell lineages with a broad range of effector functions against cancer cells.



 CAR PBMCs were generated by ultra-rapid flow electroporation of mRNA into PBMCs isolated from healthy donors or glioblastoma patients. Cell types and states within multi-targeting and multi-functional CAR PBMCs were characterized by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. Their anti-tumor activity and safety were assessed in vitro using patient-derived cell lines and human glioma-bearing organotypic brain slice cultures as well as in vivo using orthotopic glioma mouse models.



 Ultra-rapid cell manipulation resulted in highly efficient cell engineering of multicellular CAR immune cells with excellent cell viabilities and high transgene expression across immune cell types. In vitro killing assays revealed promising antigen-specific anti-glioma activity. This was also confirmed in human organotypic glioma-bearing brain slice cultures, which also revealed promising safety, as there was no off-target toxicity against neurons, microglia or astrocytes. In orthotopic glioma mouse models, multifunctional and multitargeting CAR PBMC therapy reduced tumor volumes and prolonged survival, without signs of toxicity.



 This study highlights the potential of CAR-PBMCs as a novel adoptive cell therapy for glioblastoma, offering simplified and clinically applicable manufacturing. The safety and efficacy profile provides a strong foundation for clinical translation.

In cancer, tumor-derived exosomes—referred to as cancer-derived exosomes (CDEs)—have emerged as critical regulators of immune evasion, tumor progression, and therapy resistance within the tumor microenvironment (TME). CDEs modulate immune cell function through the transfer of immunosuppressive proteins, cytokines, and non-coding RNAs, ultimately reprogramming immune surveillance mechanisms. This review provides an in-depth analysis of how CDEs influence major immune cell subsets—including T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells—thereby establishing an immunosuppressive TME. We also explore the potential of immune cell-derived exosomes (IDEs) as emerging immunotherapeutic tools capable of counteracting the suppressive effects of CDEs. Furthermore, we highlight exosome engineering strategies aimed at improving therapeutic cargo delivery, tumor targeting, and antitumor immune activation. Finally, we discuss how exosome profiling offers promise in liquid biopsy diagnostics and how integration with 3D tumor models and advanced bioengineering can accelerate the clinical translation of exosome-based cancer immunotherapies.">

Exercise enhances immune cell activation and infiltration into tumors, modulates checkpoint and cytokine signaling cascades, and mitigates treatment-related side effects, thereby improving patient compliance. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial omics, provide unprecedented insights into immune cell heterogeneity and signal transduction dynamics in the TME, uncovering new targets for exercise-modulated therapies.

Personalized exercise regimens, tailored to individual patient profiles, are critical for optimizing therapeutic responses. Integrating exercise with immunotherapy, guided by single-cell and systems-level analyses, may provide a transformative approach for improving the clinical outcomes of AR and NPC patients, paving the way for more effective, individualized cancer treatments.">

Macrophage-derived exosomes have emerged as important mediators of intercellular communication, reflecting the functional state of their parent cells while influencing recipient cell behavior. Exosomes from M1 macrophages amplify inflammation through cytokines and microRNAs, whereas M2-derived exosomes support tissue repair and immune regulation.

        <tr id="Adoptive transfer of NK cells can induce complete remissions in 30-50% of patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoma. While blood chimerism occurs, attaining functional homing to the site of tumor without exhaustion has been elusive. During chronic infections and tumorigenesis, exposure to activating stimuli weakens the effector activity of NK cells. Despite this knowledge, there is little known about the mechanisms that govern this dysregulation and whether these disparate activating stimuli use distinct pathways to downregulate effector immunity. In this study, we reveal that chronic NK cell activating receptor (NKAR) stimulation and chronic IL-15 exposure impart distinct modes of dysregulation, with NKAR stimulation inducing a tissue resident-like state that resembles that of tumor-infiltrating NK cells in cancer patients. Using loss- and gain-of-function studies, we identify the transcription factor KLF2 as a master regulator of the NK cell response to chronic activation and provide evidence that KLF2 overexpression promotes NK cell cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and chemotaxis, and inhibits the development of dysfunctional, tissue resident-like features. Using KLF2 reporter mice, we show that in certain tissues, tissue resident NK cells are predominantly KLF2-negative while circulating NK cells in these tissues are overwhelmingly KLF2+. Lastly, using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we demonstrate that conditional KLF2 deficiency in NK cells leads to altered homing and the acquisition of tissue resident-like features in vivo. Together, these findings highlight the profound changes NK cells undergo during prolonged activation and advance our understanding of how some NK cell therapies fail during malignant relapse.">

        <tr id="Liver transplantation remains the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease (ESLD); however, immune rejection significantly hampers its long-term success. Dendritic cell-derived exosomes (DEXs) have emerged as a promising tool for inducing immune tolerance and enabling precise immunomodulation in liver transplantation, owing to their unique bidirectional immunoregulatory capabilities. This review systematically summarizes the biological characteristics and functional properties of DEXs, with a particular focus on their multidimensional regulatory mechanisms within the hepatic transplant immune microenvironment. These include: the mechanisms and pathways by which DEXs mediate immune tolerance; the synergistic immunoregulatory roles of DEXs and exosomes derived from other immune cells. Furthermore, we explore the potential of DEXs for integrated diagnostic and therapeutic applications, engineering upgrades to treatment strategies, and their prospects for clinical translation. Despite their promise, several challenges persist, including difficulties in exosome isolation and purification, prolonged preparation times, bioengineering limitations, and the lack of effective in vivo tracking methods. We propose that advancements in artificial intelligence, biomaterials science, and interdisciplinary technologies may help overcome these barriers, facilitating the precise isolation, functional optimization, and clinical translation of DEXs. This review emphasizes the molecular immunoregulatory networks governed by DEXs and discusses their translational pathways, aiming to promote individualized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in liver transplantation.">

        <tr id="Macrophages and T cells communicate under homeostatic and pathological conditions. Previous studies elucidated biochemical crosstalk between macrophages and T cells. However, recent technological advances in multiplex tissue imaging reveal that these cells are often located proximally. Notably, recent clinical studies link the proximity of macrophages and T cells to cancer outcomes. These observations suggest that physical contact between the two cell types might influence their phenotype and activity. However, systematic investigations of the potential role of physical contact between these cells are lacking. To address this gap, we developed three-dimensional (3D) coculture assays to study the potential role of physical contact between naïve macrophages and activated CD8+ T cells cultured in 3D Matrigel matrix. Under contact conditions, macrophages and T cells were coencapsulated in the same matrix, whereas under no-contact conditions, they were cultured in matrix, separated by a Transwell membrane. Our findings indicated that T cells changed their migration behavior by stopping and moving over the surface of naïve macrophages during coculture. We quantitatively determined T cells establish durable contact with macrophages, which informed our hypothesis that physical interactions between macrophage-T cells may induce phenotypic changes. Physical contact led to a 3-fold increase in IFN-γ secretion, a key effector molecule of CD8+ T cells. The increase in IFN-γ was mediated by JAK and led to a 2-fold upregulation of ICAM-1 and increased PD-L1 expression. Our findings point to a model whereby activated T cells migrate toward macrophages and are held in proximity by ICAM-1 adhesion molecules, leading to increased production of IFN-γ and PD-L1 expression. These results establish that physical contact is an important determinant of macrophage and T cell states. Broadly, our study establishes a foundation to use biomaterials as a tool to provide mechanistic insights into heterotypic cell interactions to enable rational manipulation of the immune response.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) are essential components of the innate immune system, functioning as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In hematological malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), TLRs influence inflammation, disease progression, and therapeutic response. This review highlights the prognostic relevance of TLR expression, the role of the MyD88 signaling pathway in clonal evolution, and the dual nature of TLR‐mediated immune responses, either promoting antitumor activity or contributing to leukemogenesis. Notably, TLR dysregulation in MDS and AML is associated with poor prognosis and genomic instability, whereas in CML, TLRs contribute to a protective microenvironment via NOD‐like and TNF‐α pathways. Therapeutic strategies targeting TLRs, including agonists and antagonists, show promise in enhancing antitumor responses, especially when combined with agents like purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitors. Furthermore, genetic variations in TLR pathways may influence individual susceptibility to infection and cancer progression, reinforcing the relevance of personalized medicine. Overall, this review underscores the need for continued research into TLR modulation as a foundation for innovative therapies in hematologic cancers.">

        <tr id="Obesity is characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammation and, paradoxically, is also associated with immune cells dysfunction. In this study, we analyzed peripheral blood Invariant Natural killer T cells (iNKT) in individuals with or without obesity. These unconventional T cells recognize lipid antigens presented by the monomorphic CD1d MHC I-like protein. We demonstrated an activation of iNKT cells in individuals with obesity associated with both increased apoptosis and dysfunction as assessed by the lack of responsiveness to PMA/Ionomycin stimulation. This disruption mainly affects the CD4− subset, more dedicated to pro-inflammatory cytokines release and cytotoxicity. Such impact could therefore be involved in the loss of immunosurveillance observed in obesity. Interestingly, CD1d is upregulated on intermediate and non-classical monocytes from individuals with obesity and its expression on both monocyte subsets is correlated with iNKT cell dysfunction. Both the activation and hypo-responsiveness of iNKT cells as well as CD1d modulation on monocytes are significantly reversed after bariatric surgery. Altogether, these data suggest that increased CD1d expression may enhance the presentation of endogenous lipid antigens, thereby contributing to iNKT cell activation in the context of obesity.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis(M.tb), remains a major global infectious disease. T cell-mediated immune responses play a crucial role in host defense against TB. Investigating the differentiation and functional status of T cell subsets may help identify novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prediction of active tuberculosis (ATB). Methods This study enrolled 140 ATB patients and 140 healthy controls (HC) to investigate the immunophenotypic differences in T cell subsets within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between T cell subsets and TB infection, as well as their potential value in predicting ATB. Propensity score matching was used to analyze the immunophenotypic differences in PBMC between mild and severe ATB patients. Results Compared with HC, ATB patients exhibited higher frequencies of CD3⁺ T cells (P < 0.0001), lower frequencies of CD4⁺ central memory T cells (CM) (P < 0.01) and CD8⁺ Effector T cells (P < 0.05), and increased frequencies of CD8⁺ CM (P < 0.01). Expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells was downregulated, while Human Leukocyte Antigen – DR (HLA-DR) expression was upregulated. CCR4⁺ memory regulatory T cells (Tregs), CD8+PD-1+ T cells, and CD4+PD-1+ T cells were closely associated with TB infection and showed potential value in predicting ATB. Severe ATB patients had more CD8⁺ HLA-DR+ T cells (P < 0.05) and fewer CD4⁺ Effector T cells (P < 0.05). Conclusion Differentiation and function of T cell subset are associated with TB infection. CCR4⁺ memory Tregs, CD4+PD-1+ T cells, and CD8+PD-1+ T cells show potential predictive value for ATB.

        <tr id="Radiotherapy (RT)-elicited antitumor immunity serves as a pivotal mechanism in RT-mediated tumor control. The strategic integration of RT with immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), is revolutionizing cancer therapeutics, demonstrating remarkable clinical potential. In this context, identifying molecular targets to potentiate radioimmunotherapy (RIT) efficacy represents a critical research priority. Emerging as a central immunomodulatory axis, the cGAS/STING signaling pathway bridges DNA damage response with antitumor immunity, positioning itself as a prime therapeutic target for radiation sensitization. Our study unveils caspase-activated DNase (CAD) as a previously unrecognized suppressor of cGAS/STING signaling that governs radiosensitivity in colorectal cancer (CRC). CAD physically blocks STING dimerization and cGAMP binding through a nuclease-independent function, thereby compromising RT-induced STING activation and subsequent type I interferon (IFN-I) production. Functional analyses demonstrated that CAD ablation potentiates CD8+ T cell infiltration/activation within the tumor microenvironment and synergizes with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy upon radiation. Translational validation revealed clinical correlations between CAD overexpression in CRC specimens and suboptimal radiotherapy responses coupled with diminished intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration. Collectively, our findings establish CAD as a novel rheostat of cGAS-STING signaling and propose CAD inhibition as a promising combinatorial strategy to enhance RT and RIT efficacy in CRC.">

        <tr id="Inflammation has enduring impacts on organismal immunity. However, the precise mechanisms by which tissue-restricted inflammation conditions systemic responses are poorly understood. Here, we leveraged a highly compartmentalized model of skin inflammation and identified a surprising type I interferon (IFN)-mediated activation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) that results in profound changes to systemic host responses. Post-inflamed mice were protected from atherosclerosis and had worse outcomes following influenza virus infection. This IFN-mediated HSPC modulation was dependent on IFNAR signaling and could be recapitulated with the administration of recombinant IFN-α. Importantly, the transfer of post-inflamed HSPCs was sufficient to transmit the immune suppression phenotype. IFN modulation of HSPCs was rooted both in long-term changes in chromatin accessibility and the emergence of an IFN-responsive functional state from multiple progenitor populations. Collectively, our data reveal the profound and enduring effect of transient inflammation and more specifically type I IFN signaling and set the stage for a more nuanced understanding of HSPC functional modulation by peripheral immune signals.">

        <tr id="The immune response to Trypanosoma cruzi infection relies on robust inflammatory activation of macrophages and proper CD8+ T cells function to control parasite replication. However, an exacerbated respiratory burst from macrophages can damage tissues where parasites reside, such as the heart and liver. Subsequent fibrotic repair in the heart contributes to cardiomyopathy in patients with chronic Chagas disease and in mouse models. Additionally, respiratory burst metabolites are implicated in the impairment of CD8+ T cell responses. While excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is associated with increased differentiation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), T cell receptor (TCR) nitration occurs in the presence of high extracellular nitric oxide (NO) levels. Both mechanisms contribute to CD8+ T cell suppression during T. cruzi infection. In this study, we use metformin (Metf) to balance parasite control and immune-mediated tissue damage by modulating macrophage activation. We found that Metf ex vivo treatment in peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) from acutely infected mice led to reduced iNOS expression, decreased NO production and lower secretion of IL-1β, TNF and IL-6. However, IL-12 levels increased and CD8+ T cells co-cultured with these PEMs showed enhanced proliferation and IFN-γ production. In vivo, Metf-treated infected mice exhibited lower parasitemia and improved CD8+ T cell functionality, potentially linked to reduced TCR nitration and decreased Treg frequencies in the peritoneum, as well as reduced cardiac inflammation. These findings provide new insights into the inflammatory modulation exerted by Metf and its potential impact on CD8+ T cell response and Chagas disease outcome.">

        <tr id="Exercise has long been recognized for its systemic health benefits, including modulation of the immune system. Contemporary scientific inquiry has increasingly turned toward understanding the regulatory effects of exercise on immune cell dynamics within muscle tissue, highlighting their potential role in facilitating tissue repair and modulating chronic disease pathways. Following acute bouts of exercise, especially those involving eccentric or high-intensity contractions, muscle fibers experience micro-damage that triggers a well-orchestrated immune response. This phenomenon entails a coordinated, time-sensitive accumulation of immune effector cells—namely neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes—within compromised muscle tissue. Through the release of immunoregulatory and regenerative mediators like cytokines and growth factors, these cells actively participate in coordinating tissue repair by eliminating cellular debris and resolving inflammation. Macrophage polarization from a pro-inflammatory (M1) to an anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype is particularly crucial in coordinating effective muscle repair and preventing fibrosis. However, dysregulation of this immune response, such as persistent inflammation or impaired immune cell transition, can hinder regeneration and contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic conditions like sarcopenia, insulin resistance, and muscular dystrophies. Moreover, in chronic disease states, immune cell infiltration into muscle may become maladaptive, exacerbating tissue damage and metabolic dysfunction. Regular moderate-intensity exercise appears to modulate this immune infiltration in a way that enhances repair mechanisms while reducing chronic inflammation, highlighting a potential therapeutic avenue for managing muscle-related pathologies. In-depth insight into the molecular and cellular crosstalk between physical activity and immune cell regulation in muscle tissue forms the basis for crafting specialized therapeutic strategies aimed at facilitating muscle regeneration and limiting the development of chronic pathological conditions. Through a detailed evaluation of exercise-elicited immune dynamics, this review underscores the dichotomous functions of immune cell infiltration in supporting muscle regeneration and in contributing to strategies for chronic disease prevention and management.">

 Ovarian cancer (OC) tumors commonly display an immune-cold tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by a high presence of immunosuppressive cells and low level of anti-tumor immune cell infiltration. Studies show that higher levels of immune presence and activation in tumors correlate with better patient prognosis, though clinical trials using single-agent anti-PD1 have not had encouraging results. Therefore, there is a need to develop a tumor-targeting therapeutic that enhances anti-tumor immune infiltration and activation within tumors.



 C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected (IP) with the murine OC model ID8TP53-/-;BRCA2-/-. For bioluminescence imaging (BLI) experiments, on day 45 post cancer injection, the mice received IP phosphate buffered solution (PBS) or encapsulating Luciferase mRNA (LNP-Luc). For immunoprofiling experiments, starting day 40, the mice received either IP IL-2 mRNA (LNP-IL-2), PBS, or LNP-Luc daily for 5 days. To profile, omental tumors were collected post treatment, dissociated, stained for selected immune markers, and analyzed either by conventional or spectral flow cytometry.



 We identified 3 potential LNP candidates that preferentially target OC tumor cells. To test targeting specificity, we IP delivered encapsulated luciferase mRNA in the LNPs into tumor-bearing mice. Through BLI, we identified an LNP termed L46 as our ideal candidate as we observed luminescence in omental and mesenteric tumors with no luminescence in the liver, spleen, or kidneys - sites commonly found to accumulate LNPs and can cause toxicity. Using L46, we sought to test its ability to induce immune infiltration into typically immune-cold ovarian tumors. Encapsulating human IL-2 mRNA, we confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the presence of IL-2 protein in ascites only within the LNP-IL-2 treated mice compared to LNP-Luc and PBS controls. With this IL-2 mRNA delivery, flow cytometry showed significantly increased infiltration of CD45+ cells and CD3+ T cells compared to both controls. Additionally, CD8+ T cells were significantly more activated (higher %CD25+ and higher intensity of ICOS) and showed higher degranulation potential (higher %GZMB+), while total CD3+ T cells were significantly less exhausted (lower %PD1+). This treatment showed no observed toxicity and prolonged overall survival from an average of 8 weeks in the PBS and LNP-Luc groups to 13.5 weeks in the LNP-IL-2 group.



 Our LNP L46 preferentially targets OC cells without being endocytosed in benign tissue, allowing for targeted therapeutic delivery and potential minimization of side effects. With this tumor-targeting ability, L46 delivery of IL-2 mRNA induced translation of IL-2 protein, prolonged mouse survival, increased immune cell presence, and significantly increased T cell infiltration and activation. These findings emphasize the therapeutic potential of tumor-targeted IL-2 mRNA delivery in enhancing anti-tumor immunity and prolonging survival in OC.

They exhibit high microbicidal activity and a combination of cytotoxic mechanisms that may lead to bystander tissue damage. However, this classical and simplistic view of the neutrophil biology has recently dramatically changed. Emerging evidence indicates an active role for neutrophils in resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. This review specifically explores the mechanisms through which neutrophils perform their anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing roles, which are also modulated by circadian rhythms—an aspect that influences immune activity and may have implications for treatment timing. A particular focus is placed on the role of platelet-derived products in modulating local neutrophil immune responses. The remarkable phenotypic plasticity of neutrophils and their crucial role in resolving inflammation and restoring homeostasis underscore their promise as a therapeutic approach. However, their activity must be finely regulated to prevent potential tissue damage.">

This makes it challenging to isolate a specific subset of immune cells, particularly cytokines, and their contribution to vascular dysfunction remains difficult to elucidate. To solve this problem, our laboratory has developed the novel “immune cell-aorta” co-culture system described herein. This experimental protocol enables investigators to isolate an immune cell of interest and identify the cytokine(s) at the origin of vascular alterations. Key features • Novel ex vivo approach combining the culture of one population of immune cells with blood vessels. • No direct contact between the cells and the blood vessels; the model enables studying the role of immune cell–derived factors or cytokines on vascular function. • Blood vessels can subsequently be used for functional (wire/pressure myography), molecular (western blot, quantitative real-time RT-PCR), and histological studies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Neutrophils use Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) to recognize IgG-opsonized pathogens, triggering antimicrobial functions including phagocytosis, ROS production, and cytokine release. CD16b, the most abundant FcγR on neutrophils, plays a key role in initiating these responses, while CD32a is another abundant FcγR on neutrophils that contributes to modulating immune functions. CD16b lacks an intracellular domain and its signaling mechanisms remain unclear. The prevalence of the CD16b-deficient phenotype on donor neutrophils is estimated at <1% of the global population, which complicates its study. To address this, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 to generate HL-60-derived neutrophil-like cells deficient for CD16b or CD32a, that facilitate investigation of their respective roles in neutrophil biology. Methods We disrupted the FCGR3B or FCGR2A genes using CRISPR/Cas9 in the HL-60 cell line and differentiated clones into neutrophil-like cells using 1.3% DMSO. Functional assays were performed, including phagocytosis, ROS production, SYK phosphorylation, and cytokine responses. Results and discussion Both CD16b-/- and CD32a-/- HL-60-derived clones maintained neutrophilic differentiation and phagocytic capacity but displayed impaired FcγR-mediated ROS production and SYK phosphorylation, with more pronounced defects in CD16b-/- cells. Cytokine production was altered in both lines, with CD16b-/- cells producing less IL-6 and IL-1β, and CD32a-/- cells producing less TNF-α and IL-10. This model provides new insights into the distinct roles of CD16b and CD32a in neutrophil activation and immune responses.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immunosuppressive factors within the tumor microenvironment hinder effective antitumor immune responses and limit the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Immunomodulators offer an alternative by activating immune effectors. Proteases from various sources used as cancer therapy adjuvants have shown promise in inhibiting tumor growth. Our previous work showed that the bacterial metalloprotease arazyme has a strong in vivo antimetastatic effect in the B16F10-Nex2 murine melanoma model. Interestingly, heat-inactivated arazyme also exhibited antitumor properties dependent on an intact adaptive immune response, highlighting its immunomodulatory role. To assess whether this effect is unique to arazyme, we examined another bacterial metalloprotease, Oligopeptidase A (OpdA). Methods OpdA was produced and purified. Endotoxin levels were measured. C57BL/6 mice received intravenous B16F10-Nex2 cells, followed by treatments with either active or heat-inactivated OpdA. Pulmonary nodules were counted. Immune cells involved in the response were characterized using FACS and depletion experiments. Cytokines were measured by ELISA and intracellular cytokine analysis. OpdA receptor activation was studied in bone marrow-derived cells from knockout and wild-type mice using inhibitors. Results Heat-inactivated OpdA significantly reduced metastasis, dependent on tumor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ, both locally and systemically, with decreased IL-10 levels suggesting a proinflammatory environment. Treatment increased secretion of nitric oxide, IL-12p40, and TNF-α from bone marrow cells via enzymatic activity, involving MyD88/TRIF and MAPK pathways. Conclusion: OpdA shows potential as a tumor vaccine adjuvant, promoting antigen presentation and tumor-specific immune responses.">

        <tr id="Visual Abstract As rapid responders to their environments, microglia engage in functions that are mirrored by their cellular morphology. Microglia are classically thought to exhibit a ramified morphology under homeostatic conditions which switches to an ameboid form during inflammatory conditions. However, microglia display a wide spectrum of morphologies outside of this dichotomy, including rod-like, ramified, ameboid, and hypertrophic states, which have been observed across brain regions, neurodevelopmental timepoints, and various pathological contexts. We applied dimensionality reduction and clustering to consider contributions of multiple morphology measures together to define a spectrum of microglial morphological states in a mouse dataset that we used to demonstrate the utility of our toolset. Using ImageJ, we first developed a semiautomated approach to characterize 27 morphology features from hundreds to thousands of individual microglial cells in a brain region-specific manner. Within this pool of features, we defined distinct sets of highly correlated features that describe different aspects of morphology, including branch length, branching complexity, territory span, and circularity. When considered together, these sets of features drove different morphological clusters. Our tools captured morphological states similarly and robustly when applied to independent datasets and using different immunofluorescent markers for microglia. We have compiled our morphology analysis pipeline into an accessible, easy-to-use, and fully open-source ImageJ macro and R package that the neuroscience community can expand upon and directly apply to their own analyses. Outcomes from this work will supply the field with new tools to systematically evaluate the heterogeneity of microglia morphological states across various experimental models and research questions.">

        <tr id="Quantification of microglial activation through morphometric analysis has long been a staple of the neuroimmunologist’s toolkit. Microglial morphological phenomics can be conducted through either manual classification or constructing a digital skeleton and extracting morphometric data from it. Multiple open-access and paid software packages are available to generate these skeletons via semi-automated and/or fully automated methods with varying degrees of accuracy. Despite advancements in methods to generate morphometrics (quantitative measures of cellular morphology), there has been limited development of tools to analyze the datasets they generate, in particular those containing parameters from tens of thousands of cells analyzed by fully automated pipelines. In this review, we compare and critique the approaches using cluster analysis and machine learning driven predictive algorithms that have been developed to tackle these large datasets, and propose improvements for these methods. In particular, we highlight the need for a commitment to open science from groups developing these classifiers. Furthermore, we call attention to a need for communication between those with a strong software engineering/computer science background and neuroimmunologists to produce effective analytical tools with simplified operability if we are to see their wide-spread adoption by the glia biology community.">

        <tr id="The rising global prevalence of neuroinflammatory diseases poses a formidable public health challenge. Central to these pathologies are microglia, the innate immune sentinels of the central nervous system, whose dysregulation contributes significantly to neurodegeneration. In 2025, the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and neurobiology is catalyzing a paradigm shift in the restoration of neural homeostasis. This paper presents a forward-looking synthesis of how AI-driven platforms are enabling high-throughput analysis of multi-omics data to identify actionable microglial targets such as TREM2 and CSF1R for therapeutic modulation. Coupled with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, AI orchestrates the reprogramming of microglia toward neuroprotective phenotypes, thereby mitigating neuroinflammation and facilitating cognitive recovery in preclinical models. While promising, challenges remain: addressing microglial heterogeneity, establishing reliable biomarkers, ensuring long-term safety, and overcoming ethical and regulatory barriers. This article advocates for multidisciplinary collaboration, infrastructure reform, and equitable policy frameworks to advance AI-orchestrated microglial therapies from research to clinical application, marking a transformative stride in precision neurology.">

        <tr id="Microglia exhibit diverse morphologies reflecting environmental conditions, maturity, or functional states. Thus, morphological characterization provides important information to understand microglial roles and functions. Most recent morphological analysis relies on classifying cells based on morphological parameters. However, this classification may lack biological relevance, as microglial morphologies represent a continuum rather than distinct, separate groups, and do not correspond to mathematically defined clusters irrelevant of microglial cells function. Instead, we propose a new open-source tool, MorphoCellSorter, which assesses microglial morphology by automatically computing morphological criteria, using principal component analysis and Andrews plots to score cells. MorphoCellSorter properly ranked cells from various microglia datasets in mice and rats of different ages, from in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo models, that were acquired using diverse imaging techniques. This approach allowed for the discrimination of cell populations in various pathophysiological conditions. Finally, MorphoCellSorter offers a versatile, easy, and ready-to-use method to evaluate microglial morphological diversity that could easily be generalized to standardize practices across laboratories.">

        <tr id="As rapid responders to their environments, microglia engage in functions that are mirrored by their cellular morphology. Microglia are classically thought to exhibit a ramified morphology under homeostatic conditions which switches to an ameboid form during inflammatory conditions. However, microglia display a wide spectrum of morphologies outside of this dichotomy, including rod-like, ramified, ameboid, and hypertrophic states, which have been observed across brain regions, neurodevelopmental timepoints, and various pathological contexts. We used dimensionality reduction and clustering approaches to consider contributions of multiple morphology measures together to define a spectrum of microglial morphological states. Using ImageJ tools, we first developed a semi-automated approach to characterize 27 morphology features from hundreds to thousands of individual microglial cells in a brain subregion-specific manner. Within this pool of morphology measures, we defined distinct sets of highly correlated features that describe different aspects of morphology, including branch length, branching complexity, territory span, and cell circularity. When considered together, these sets of features drove different morphological clusters. Furthermore, our analysis toolset captured morphological states similarly and robustly when applied to independent datasets and using different immunofluorescent markers for microglia. We have compiled our morphology analysis pipeline into an accessible, easy to use, and fully open-source ImageJ macro and R package that the neuroscience community can expand upon and directly apply to their own analyses. Outcomes from this work will supply the field with new tools to systematically evaluate the heterogeneity of microglia morphological states across various experimental models and research questions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Extracellular vesicle (EV) research increasingly demands for quantitative characterisation at the single vesicle level to address heterogeneity and complexity of EV subpopulations. Emerging, commercialised technologies for single EV analysis based on, for example, imaging flow cytometry or imaging after capture on chips generally require dedicated instrumentation and proprietary software not readily accessible to every lab. This limits their implementation for routine EV characterisation in the rapidly growing EV field. We and others have shown that single vesicles can be detected as light diffraction limited fluorescent spots using standard confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopes. Advancing this simple strategy into a process for routine EV quantitation, we developed ‘EVAnalyzer’, an ImageJ/Fiji (Fiji is just ImageJ) plugin for automated, quantitative single vesicle analysis from imaging data. Using EVAnalyzer, we established a robust protocol for capture, (immuno‐)labelling and fluorescent imaging of EVs. To exemplify the application scope, the process was optimised and systematically tested for (i) quantification of EV subpopulations, (ii) validation of EV labelling reagents, (iii) in situ determination of antibody specificity, sensitivity and species cross‐reactivity for EV markers and (iv) optimisation of genetic EV engineering. Additionally, we show that the process can be applied to synthetic nanoparticles, allowing to determine siRNA encapsulation efficiencies of lipid‐based nanoparticles (LNPs) and protein loading of SiO2 nanoparticles. EVAnalyzer further provides a pipeline for automated quantification of cell uptake at the single cell–single vesicle level, thereby enabling high content EV cell uptake assays and plate‐based screens. Notably, the entire procedure from sample preparation to the final data output is entirely based on standard reagents, materials, laboratory equipment and open access software. In summary, we show that EVAnalyzer enables rigorous characterisation of EVs with generally accessible tools. Since we further provide the plugin as open‐source code, we expect EVAnalyzer to not only be a resource of immediate impact, but an open innovation platform for the EV and nanoparticle research communities.">

        <tr id="Quantification of microglial activation through morphometric analysis has long been a staple of the neuroimmunologist’s toolkit. Microglial morphological phenomics can be conducted through either manual classification or constructing a digital skeleton and extracting morphometric data from it. Multiple open-access and paid software packages are available to generate these skeletons via semi-automated and/or fully automated methods with varying degrees of accuracy. Despite advancements in methods to generate morphometrics (quantitative measures of cellular morphology), there has been limited development of tools to analyze the datasets they generate, in particular those containing parameters from tens of thousands of cells analyzed by fully automated pipelines. In this review, we compare and critique the approaches using cluster analysis and machine learning driven predictive algorithms that have been developed to tackle these large datasets, and propose improvements for these methods. In particular, we highlight the need for a commitment to open science from groups developing these classifiers. Furthermore, we call attention to a need for communication between those with a strong software engineering/computer science background and neuroimmunologists to produce effective analytical tools with simplified operability if we are to see their wide-spread adoption by the glia biology community.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
A multitude of high-quality imaging modalities exist that provide structural data at unprecedented levels of detail. Tissue ultrastructure greatly influences the rate of transport of proteins and other molecules that contribute to neurodegeneration. However, our ability to model flow and diffusion processes in the brain lags behind the quality of the neuroimaging data. Here, a new framework will be presented for converting neuroimaging data into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in a scalable manner suitable for high performance computing. TEM data from the Allen Institute will illustrate its capabilities.


METHODS
Segmented TEM images were downloaded from the MicronsExplorer public storage cache. Segmented image stack volumes (4 × 4 × 4 µm) were converted into surface meshes using the Lewiner Marching Cubes algorithm. Convection and diffusion along the surface of individual cells was modeled. After each timestep mass was allowed to exchange between neighboring cells, implemented on a high performance computing cluster using the MPI protocol on 40 or more computing cores. Multiple volumes were analyzed simultaneously, with updates of the flux between cells in different volumes occurring at each time step. These steps were performed with new custom CFD code written in C and Julia.


RESULTS
Segmented z-stacks of TEM data from the MICrONS Explorer website were downloaded in 4 × 4 × 4 µm blocks, which typically contain ≈500 distinct cells (Fig. 1A&B). The meshing algorithm leads to perfect matching between adjacent cells (Fig. 1C). The convection-diffusion equations are solved, modeling flow/diffusion of solutes between cells (Fig. 1D&E). Equations are solved for all ≈500 distinct cells in parallel, with concentrations at matching faces re-balanced at each time step (Fig. 2A&B). A manager-worker MPI model allows for solution on an arbitrary number of cores (Fig. 2C). The interfaces between cell surfaces across volumes are also perfectly matched, allowing for adjustment of the flux of mass between volumes at each timestep (Fig. 2D).


CONCLUSIONS
A new modeling framework is described for solution of transport equations on high performance computing clusters for any imaging modality that produces segmented z-stacked images.">

        <tr id="Morphological states of human cells are widely imaged and analyzed to diagnose diseases and to discover biological mechanisms. Morphodynamics of cells capture their functions more fully than their morphology. Discovery of morphodynamic states of human cells is challenging, because genetic labeling or manual annotation may not be feasible. We propose a computational framework, DynaMorph, that combines quantitative label-free imaging and deep learning for automated discovery of morphodynamic states. As a case study, we apply DynaMorph to study the morphodynamic states of live primary human microglia, which are mobile immune cells of the brain that exhibit complex functional states. DynaMorph identifies two distinct morphodynamic states of microglia under perturbation by cytokines and glioblastoma supernatant. We find that microglia actively transition between the two states. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing of the perturbed microglia shows that the morphodynamic states correspond to distinct transcriptomic clusters of the cells, revealing how perturbations alter gene expression and phenotype. DynaMorph can broadly enable automated discovery of functional states of cellular systems.">

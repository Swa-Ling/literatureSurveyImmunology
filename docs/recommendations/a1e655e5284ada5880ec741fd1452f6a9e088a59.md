        <tr id="As rapid responders to their environments, microglia engage in functions that are mirrored by their cellular morphology. Microglia are classically thought to exhibit a ramified morphology under homeostatic conditions which switches to an ameboid form during inflammatory conditions. However, microglia display a wide spectrum of morphologies outside of this dichotomy, including rod-like, ramified, ameboid, and hypertrophic states, which have been observed across brain regions, neurodevelopmental timepoints, and various pathological contexts. We used dimensionality reduction and clustering approaches to consider contributions of multiple morphology measures together to define a spectrum of microglial morphological states. Using ImageJ tools, we first developed a semi-automated approach to characterize 27 morphology features from hundreds to thousands of individual microglial cells in a brain subregion-specific manner. Within this pool of morphology measures, we defined distinct sets of highly correlated features that describe different aspects of morphology, including branch length, branching complexity, territory span, and cell circularity. When considered together, these sets of features drove different morphological clusters. Furthermore, our analysis toolset captured morphological states similarly and robustly when applied to independent datasets and using different immunofluorescent markers for microglia. We have compiled our morphology analysis pipeline into an accessible, easy to use, and fully open-source ImageJ macro and R package that the neuroscience community can expand upon and directly apply to their own analyses. Outcomes from this work will supply the field with new tools to systematically evaluate the heterogeneity of microglia morphological states across various experimental models and research questions.">

Microglial morphological phenomics can be conducted through either manual classification or constructing a digital skeleton and extracting morphometric data from it. Multiple open-access and paid software packages are available to generate these skeletons via semi-automated and/or fully automated methods with varying degrees of accuracy. Despite advancements in methods to generate morphometrics (quantitative measures of cellular morphology), there has been limited development of tools to analyze the datasets they generate, in particular those containing parameters from tens of thousands of cells analyzed by fully automated pipelines. In this review, we compare and critique the approaches using cluster analysis and machine learning driven predictive algorithms that have been developed to tackle these large datasets, and propose improvements for these methods. In particular, we highlight the need for a commitment to open science from groups developing these classifiers. Furthermore, we call attention to a need for communication between those with a strong software engineering/computer science background and neuroimmunologists to produce effective analytical tools with simplified operability if we are to see their wide-spread adoption by the glia biology community.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
A multitude of high-quality imaging modalities exist that provide structural data at unprecedented levels of detail. Tissue ultrastructure greatly influences the rate of transport of proteins and other molecules that contribute to neurodegeneration. However, our ability to model flow and diffusion processes in the brain lags behind the quality of the neuroimaging data. Here, a new framework will be presented for converting neuroimaging data into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in a scalable manner suitable for high performance computing. TEM data from the Allen Institute will illustrate its capabilities.


METHODS
Segmented TEM images were downloaded from the MicronsExplorer public storage cache. Segmented image stack volumes (4 × 4 × 4 µm) were converted into surface meshes using the Lewiner Marching Cubes algorithm. Convection and diffusion along the surface of individual cells was modeled. After each timestep mass was allowed to exchange between neighboring cells, implemented on a high performance computing cluster using the MPI protocol on 40 or more computing cores. Multiple volumes were analyzed simultaneously, with updates of the flux between cells in different volumes occurring at each time step. These steps were performed with new custom CFD code written in C and Julia.


RESULTS
Segmented z-stacks of TEM data from the MICrONS Explorer website were downloaded in 4 × 4 × 4 µm blocks, which typically contain ≈500 distinct cells (Fig. 1A&B). The meshing algorithm leads to perfect matching between adjacent cells (Fig. 1C). The convection-diffusion equations are solved, modeling flow/diffusion of solutes between cells (Fig. 1D&E). Equations are solved for all ≈500 distinct cells in parallel, with concentrations at matching faces re-balanced at each time step (Fig. 2A&B). A manager-worker MPI model allows for solution on an arbitrary number of cores (Fig. 2C). The interfaces between cell surfaces across volumes are also perfectly matched, allowing for adjustment of the flux of mass between volumes at each timestep (Fig. 2D).


CONCLUSIONS
A new modeling framework is described for solution of transport equations on high performance computing clusters for any imaging modality that produces segmented z-stacked images.">

        <tr id="Microglia exhibit diverse morphologies reflecting environmental conditions, maturity or functional states. Thus, morphological characterization provides important information to understand microglial roles and functions. Most recent morphological analysis relies on classifying cells based on morphological parameters. However, this classification may lack biological relevance, as microglial morphologies represent a continuum rather than distinct, separate groups, and do not correspond to mathematically defined, clusters irrelevant of microglial cells function. Instead, we propose a new open-source tool, MorphoCellSorter, which assesses microglial morphology by automatically computing morphological criteria, using principal component analysis and Andrews plots to rank cells. MorphoCellSorter properly ranked cells from various microglia datasets in mice and rats of different age, from in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo models, that were acquired using diverse imaging techniques. This approach allowed for the discrimination of cell populations in various pathophysiological conditions. Finally, MorphoCellSorter offers a versatile, easy and ready-to-use method to evaluate microglial morphological diversity that could easily be generalized to standardize practices across laboratories.">

        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe neurological disorder with a pathogenesis that remains incompletely understood. Recently, a novel form of cell death known as disulfidptosis has garnered significant attention in the field of ischemic stroke research. This study aims to investigate the mechanistic roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in the context of IS and to examine their correlation with immunopathological features. Methods To enhance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of disulfidptosis in IS, we initially retrieved the expression profile of peripheral blood from human IS patients from the GEO database. We then utilized a suite of machine learning algorithms, including LASSO, random forest, and SVM-RFE, to identify and validate pivotal genes. Furthermore, we developed a predictive nomogram model, integrating multifactorial logistic regression analysis and calibration curves, to evaluate the risk of IS. For the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, we employed a range of analytical tools, such as "Monocle" and "CellChat," to assess the status of immune cell infiltration and to characterize intercellular communication networks. Additionally, we utilized an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) model to investigate the effects of SLC7A11 overexpression on microglial polarization. Results This study successfully identified key genes associated with disulfidptosis and developed a reliable nomogram model using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of ischemic stroke. Examination of single-cell sequencing data showed a robust correlation between disulfidptosis levels and the infiltration of immune cells. Furthermore, "CellChat" analysis elucidated the intricate characteristics of intercellular communication networks. Notably, the TNF signaling pathway was found to be intimately linked with the disulfidptosis signature in ischemic stroke. In an intriguing finding, the OGD model demonstrated that SLC7A11 expression suppresses M1 polarization while promoting M2 polarization in microglia. Conclusion The significance of our findings lies in their potential to shed light on the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, particularly by underscoring the pivotal role of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs). These insights could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting DRGs to mitigate the impact of ischemic stroke.

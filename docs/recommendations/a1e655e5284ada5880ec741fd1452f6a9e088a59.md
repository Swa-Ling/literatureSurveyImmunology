Pathogen‐derived EVs hold significant diagnostic potential because of their unique cargo, offering a wealth of potential biomarkers. In this review, we first discuss the roles of EVs derived from various pathogens in host–pathogen interactions and summarize the latest advancements in pathogen detection based on EVs. Then, we highlight innovative strategies, including novel aggregate materials and machine learning approaches, for enhancing EV detection and analysis. Finally, we discuss challenges in the field and future directions for advancing EV‐based diagnostics, aiming to translate these insights into clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Abstract Extracellular vesicle (EV) research increasingly demands for quantitative characterisation at the single vesicle level to address heterogeneity and complexity of EV subpopulations. Emerging, commercialised technologies for single EV analysis based on, for example, imaging flow cytometry or imaging after capture on chips generally require dedicated instrumentation and proprietary software not readily accessible to every lab. This limits their implementation for routine EV characterisation in the rapidly growing EV field. We and others have shown that single vesicles can be detected as light diffraction limited fluorescent spots using standard confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopes. Advancing this simple strategy into a process for routine EV quantitation, we developed ‘EVAnalyzer’, an ImageJ/Fiji (Fiji is just ImageJ) plugin for automated, quantitative single vesicle analysis from imaging data. Using EVAnalyzer, we established a robust protocol for capture, (immuno‐)labelling and fluorescent imaging of EVs. To exemplify the application scope, the process was optimised and systematically tested for (i) quantification of EV subpopulations, (ii) validation of EV labelling reagents, (iii) in situ determination of antibody specificity, sensitivity and species cross‐reactivity for EV markers and (iv) optimisation of genetic EV engineering. Additionally, we show that the process can be applied to synthetic nanoparticles, allowing to determine siRNA encapsulation efficiencies of lipid‐based nanoparticles (LNPs) and protein loading of SiO2 nanoparticles. EVAnalyzer further provides a pipeline for automated quantification of cell uptake at the single cell–single vesicle level, thereby enabling high content EV cell uptake assays and plate‐based screens. Notably, the entire procedure from sample preparation to the final data output is entirely based on standard reagents, materials, laboratory equipment and open access software. In summary, we show that EVAnalyzer enables rigorous characterisation of EVs with generally accessible tools. Since we further provide the plugin as open‐source code, we expect EVAnalyzer to not only be a resource of immediate impact, but an open innovation platform for the EV and nanoparticle research communities.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes are important regulators of normal brain function in mammals, including roles in synaptic signaling, synapse formation, and neuronal health and survival. Many of these functions are executed via secreted proteins. To analyze the astrocyte secretome, a combination of shotgun proteomics and bioinformatics was employed to analyze conditioned media from primary murine astrocyte cultures. Both two- and one-dimensional LC-MS/MS were used to analyze astrocyte secreted proteins, resulting in the identification of over 420 proteins. To refine our results, the intracellular protein contaminants were removed in silico using a cytoplasmic control. In additional rounds of refinement, putative secreted proteins were subjected to analysis by SignalP, SecretomeP, and gene ontology analysis, yielding a refined list of 187 secreted proteins. In conclusion, the use of shotgun proteomics combined with multiple rounds of data refinement produced a high quality catalog of astrocyte secreted proteins.">

        <tr id="Background Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition triggered by immune system malfunction. Mitochondrial extracellular vesicles (MitoEVs) are a group of highly heterogeneous extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in mitochondrial fractions. The objective of this research was to examine the correlation between MitoEVs and the immune microenvironment of periodontitis. Methods Data from MitoCarta 3.0, GeneCards, and GEO databases were utilized to identify differentially expressed MitoEV-related genes (MERGs) and conduct functional enrichment and pathway analyses. The random forest and LASSO algorithms were employed to identify hub MERGs. Infiltration levels of immune cells in periodontitis and healthy groups were estimated using the CIBERSORT algorithm, and phenotypic subgroups of periodontitis based on hub MERG expression levels were explored using a consensus clustering method. Results A total of 44 differentially expressed MERGs were identified. The random forest and LASSO algorithms identified 9 hub MERGs (BCL2L11, GLDC, CYP24A1, COQ2, MTPAP, NIPSNAP3A, FAM162A, MYO19, and NDUFS1). ROC curve analysis showed that the hub gene and logistic regression model presented excellent diagnostic and discriminating abilities. Immune infiltration and consensus clustering analysis indicated that hub MERGs were highly correlated with various types of immune cells, and there were significant differences in immune cells and hub MERGs among different periodontitis subtypes. Conclusion The periodontitis classification model based on MERGs shows excellent performance and can offer novel perspectives into the pathogenesis of periodontitis. The high correlation between MERGs and various immune cells and the significant differences between immune cells and MERGs in different periodontitis subtypes can clarify the regulatory roles of MitoEVs in the immune microenvironment of periodontitis. Future research should focus on elucidating the functional mechanisms of hub MERGs and exploring potential therapeutic interventions based on these findings.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous structures released by cells into the extracellular space and are thought to be involved in cell-to-cell communication. While EVs and their cargo are promising biomarker candidates, protein sorting mechanisms of proteins to EVs remain unclear. In this study, we ask if it is possible to determine EV association based on the protein sequence. Additionally, we ask what the most important determinants are for EV association. We answer these questions with explainable AI models, using human proteome data from EV databases to train and validate the model. It is essential to correct the datasets for contaminants introduced by coarse EV isolation workflows and for experimental bias caused by mass spectrometry. In this study, we show that it is indeed possible to predict EV association from the protein sequence: a simple sequence-based model for predicting EV proteins achieved an area under the curve of 0.77±0.01, which increased further to 0.84±0.00 when incorporating curated post-translational modification (PTM) annotations. Feature analysis shows that EV associated proteins are stable, polar, and structured with low isoelectric point compared to non-EV proteins. PTM annotations emerged as the most important features for correct classification; specifically palmitoylation is one of the most prevalent EV sorting mechanisms for unique proteins. Palmitoylation and nitrosylation sites are especially prevalent in EV proteins that are determined by very strict isolation protocols, indicating they could potentially serve as quality control criteria for future studies. This computational study offers an effective sequence-based predictor of EV associated proteins with extensive characterisation of the human EV proteome that can explain for individual proteins which factors contribute to their EV association.">

Unlike other extracellular vesicles (ectosomes and apoptotic blebs), exosomes are of endocytic origin. The roles of exosomes in vaccine/drug delivery, intercellular communication and as a possible source of disease biomarkers have sparked immense interest in them, resulting in a plethora of studies. Whilst multidimensional datasets are continuously generated, it is difficult to harness the true potential of the data until they are compiled and made accessible to the biomedical researchers. Here, we describe ExoCarta (http://www.exocarta.org), a manually curated database of exosomal proteins, RNA and lipids. Datasets currently present in ExoCarta are integrated from both published and unpublished exosomal studies. Since its launch in 2009, ExoCarta has been accessed by more than 16,000 unique users. In this article, we discuss the utility of ExoCarta for exosomal research and urge biomedical researchers in the field to deposit their datasets directly to ExoCarta.">

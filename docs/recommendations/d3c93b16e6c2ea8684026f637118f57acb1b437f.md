        <tr id="During the course of respiratory infections such as influenza, we do have a very limited view of immunological indicators to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the outcome of a host. Methods for monitoring immunological markers in a host’s lungs are invasive and expensive, and some of them are not feasible to perform. ABSTRACT The tracking of pathogen burden and host responses with minimally invasive methods during respiratory infections is central for monitoring disease development and guiding treatment decisions. Utilizing a standardized murine model of respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we developed and tested different supervised machine learning models to predict viral burden and immune response markers, i.e., cytokines and leukocytes in the lung, from hematological data. We performed independently in vivo infection experiments to acquire extensive data for training and testing of the models. We show here that lung viral load, neutrophil counts, cytokines (such as gamma interferon [IFN-γ] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]), and other lung infection markers can be predicted from hematological data. Furthermore, feature analysis of the models showed that blood granulocytes and platelets play a crucial role in prediction and are highly involved in the immune response against IAV. The proposed in silico tools pave the path toward improved tracking and monitoring of influenza virus infections and possibly other respiratory infections based on minimally invasively obtained hematological parameters. IMPORTANCE During the course of respiratory infections such as influenza, we do have a very limited view of immunological indicators to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the outcome of a host. Methods for monitoring immunological markers in a host’s lungs are invasive and expensive, and some of them are not feasible to perform. Using machine learning algorithms, we show for the first time that minimally invasively acquired hematological parameters can be used to infer lung viral burden, leukocytes, and cytokines following influenza virus infection in mice. The potential of the framework proposed here consists of a new qualitative vision of the disease processes in the lung compartment as a noninvasive tool.">

 An organism’s immune system tries to protect it by identifying the presence of pathogens and attempting to eliminate them. The defense is twofold: innate immune cells mobilize rapidly, while acquired immune cells slowly develop into pathogen-killing specialists. These responses incur collateral tissue damage, which anti-inflammatory mediators seek to control. This system of checks and balances is responsible for host survival. Experimental research has demonstrated how vastly complex these interactions are, indicating a place for theoretical and computational study. In this work we develop a comprehensive differential equation model of the immune system by considering interactions between immune system components in the presence of pathogen or tissue trauma. Through this step-by-step construction we explore the dependence of the anti-inflammatory mediators on pathogen levels, and also how they temper the immune response at the end of infection. We then challenge the “virtual mouse” with typical pathogens of varying virulence and observe the outcomes via model simulation. We find that anti-inflammation can downregulate the activation and proliferation of immune cells or promote apoptosis as cessation mechanisms, suggesting the need for in vivo experiments. Bifurcation theory describes how the outcomes of infection depend on model parameters, from which we conclude that initial insult and pathogen growth rate allow us to predict whether or not the in silico mouse overcomes the disease in a deterministic framework.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viruses present major health challenges, as evidenced by the 2009 influenza pandemic and the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Severe RNA virus respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestation at the cell and tissue levels are vital to understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and developing improved, strain independent treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular spatial computational model of two principal components of tissue infection and response: RNA virus replication and type-I interferon mediated antiviral response to infection within lung epithelial cells. The model is parameterized using data from influenza virus infected cell cultures and, consistent with experimental observations, exhibits either linear radial growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons. Modulating the phosphorylation of STAT or altering the ratio of the diffusion constants of interferon and virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of arrest on diffusion constants highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for in vitro experiments to measure these diffusion constants. Sensitivity analyses were performed under conditions creating both continuous plaque growth and arrested plaque growth. Findings suggest that plaque growth and cytokine assay measurements should be collected during arrested plaque growth, as the model parameters are significantly more sensitive and more likely to be identifiable. The model’s metrics replicate experimental immunostaining imaging and titer based sampling assays. The model is easy to extend to include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms as they are discovered or to include as a component linking epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models. Author Summary COVID-19 is possibly the defining healthcare crisis of the current generation, with tens of millions of global cases and more than a million reported deaths. Respiratory lung infections form lesions in the lungs, whose number and size correlate with severity of illness. In some severe cases, the disease triggers a severe inflammatory condition known as cytokine storm. Given the complexity of the immune system, computational modeling is needed to link molecular signaling at the site of inflection to the signaling impact on the overall immune system, ultimately revealing how severe inflammatory conditions may emerge. Here, we created a computational model of the early stages of infection that simulates lung cells infected with RNA viruses, such those responsible for COVID-19 and influenza, to help explore how the disease forms viral plaques, an in vitro analog to lesion growth in the lung. Our model recapitulates in vitro observations that pretreatment of biological signaling molecules called with type-I interferons, which are currently being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Analyzing the model, we, can stop viral plaque growth. We found that enhancing certain aspects of the innate immune system, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, may be able to stop viral plaque growth, suggesting molecules involved in this pathway as possible drug candidates. Quantifying the parameters needed to model interferon signaling and viral replication, experiments should be performed under conditions that inhibit viral growth, such as pretreating cells with interferon. We present a computational framework that is essential to constructing larger models of respiratory infection induced immune responses, can be used to evaluate drugs and other medical interventions quickly, cheaply, and without the need for animal testing during the initial phase, and that defines experiments needed to improve our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms regulating the immune response.">

        <tr id="Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious complication in clinical settings. This study aimed to elucidate the immune molecular mechanisms underlying ALI by bioinformatics analysis. Human ALI and six ALI mouse model datasets were collected. Immune cell infiltration between the ALI samples and non-ALI controls was estimated using the ssGSEA algorithm. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and Wilcoxon test were performed to obtain the significantly different immune cell infiltration types. Immune feature genes were screened by differential analysis and the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm. Functional enrichment was then performed and candidate hub biomarkers were identified. Finally, the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to predict their diagnostic performances. Three significantly different immune cell types (B cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells) were identified between the ALI samples and controls. A total of 13 immune feature genes were obtained by WGCNA and differential analysis and found to be significantly associated with immune functions and lung diseases. Four hub genes, including CD180, CD4, CD74, and MCL1 were identified using cytoHubba and were shown to have good specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of ALI. Correlation analysis suggested that CD4 was positively associated with T cells, whereas MCL1 was negatively correlated with B and T cells. We found that CD180, CD4, CD74, and MCL1 can serve as specific immune biomarkers for ALI. MCL1–B cell, MCL1–T cell, and CD4–T cell axes may be involved in the progression of ALI.">

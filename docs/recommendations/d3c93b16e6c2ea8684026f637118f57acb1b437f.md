        <tr id="Respiratory viruses present major health challenges, as evidenced by the 2009 influenza pandemic and the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Severe RNA virus respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestation at the cell and tissue levels are vital to understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and developing improved, strain independent treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular spatial computational model of two principal components of tissue infection and response: RNA virus replication and type-I interferon mediated antiviral response to infection within lung epithelial cells. The model is parameterized using data from influenza virus infected cell cultures and, consistent with experimental observations, exhibits either linear radial growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons. Modulating the phosphorylation of STAT or altering the ratio of the diffusion constants of interferon and virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of arrest on diffusion constants highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for in vitro experiments to measure these diffusion constants. Sensitivity analyses were performed under conditions creating both continuous plaque growth and arrested plaque growth. Findings suggest that plaque growth and cytokine assay measurements should be collected during arrested plaque growth, as the model parameters are significantly more sensitive and more likely to be identifiable. The model’s metrics replicate experimental immunostaining imaging and titer based sampling assays. The model is easy to extend to include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms as they are discovered or to include as a component linking epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models. Author Summary COVID-19 is possibly the defining healthcare crisis of the current generation, with tens of millions of global cases and more than a million reported deaths. Respiratory lung infections form lesions in the lungs, whose number and size correlate with severity of illness. In some severe cases, the disease triggers a severe inflammatory condition known as cytokine storm. Given the complexity of the immune system, computational modeling is needed to link molecular signaling at the site of inflection to the signaling impact on the overall immune system, ultimately revealing how severe inflammatory conditions may emerge. Here, we created a computational model of the early stages of infection that simulates lung cells infected with RNA viruses, such those responsible for COVID-19 and influenza, to help explore how the disease forms viral plaques, an in vitro analog to lesion growth in the lung. Our model recapitulates in vitro observations that pretreatment of biological signaling molecules called with type-I interferons, which are currently being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Analyzing the model, we, can stop viral plaque growth. We found that enhancing certain aspects of the innate immune system, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, may be able to stop viral plaque growth, suggesting molecules involved in this pathway as possible drug candidates. Quantifying the parameters needed to model interferon signaling and viral replication, experiments should be performed under conditions that inhibit viral growth, such as pretreating cells with interferon. We present a computational framework that is essential to constructing larger models of respiratory infection induced immune responses, can be used to evaluate drugs and other medical interventions quickly, cheaply, and without the need for animal testing during the initial phase, and that defines experiments needed to improve our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms regulating the immune response.">

        <tr id="Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious complication in clinical settings. This study aimed to elucidate the immune molecular mechanisms underlying ALI by bioinformatics analysis. Human ALI and six ALI mouse model datasets were collected. Immune cell infiltration between the ALI samples and non-ALI controls was estimated using the ssGSEA algorithm. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and Wilcoxon test were performed to obtain the significantly different immune cell infiltration types. Immune feature genes were screened by differential analysis and the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm. Functional enrichment was then performed and candidate hub biomarkers were identified. Finally, the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to predict their diagnostic performances. Three significantly different immune cell types (B cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells) were identified between the ALI samples and controls. A total of 13 immune feature genes were obtained by WGCNA and differential analysis and found to be significantly associated with immune functions and lung diseases. Four hub genes, including CD180, CD4, CD74, and MCL1 were identified using cytoHubba and were shown to have good specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of ALI. Correlation analysis suggested that CD4 was positively associated with T cells, whereas MCL1 was negatively correlated with B and T cells. We found that CD180, CD4, CD74, and MCL1 can serve as specific immune biomarkers for ALI. MCL1–B cell, MCL1–T cell, and CD4–T cell axes may be involved in the progression of ALI.">

        <tr id="Many aspects of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are still poorly understood. Yet these knowledge gaps have had and could continue to have adverse, unintended consequences for the efficacy and safety of antivirals and vaccines developed against RSV. Mathematical modelling was used to test and evaluate hypotheses about the rate of loss of RSV infectivity and the mechanisms and kinetics of RSV infection spread in SIAT cells in vitro. While the rate of loss of RSV integrity, as measured via qRT-PCR, is well-described by an exponential decay, the latter mechanism failed to describe the rate at which RSV A Long loses infectivity over time in vitro based on the data presented herein. This is unusual given that other viruses (HIV, HCV, influenza) have been shown to lose their infectivity exponentially in vitro, and indeed an exponential rate of loss of infectivity is always assumed in mathematical modelling and experimental analyses. The infectivity profile of RSV in HEp-2 and SIAT cells remained consistent over the course of an RSV infection, over time and a large range of infectivity. However, SIAT cells were found to be ∼ 100× less sensitive to RSV infection than HEp-2 cells. In particular, we found that RSV spreads inefficiently in SIAT cells, in a manner we show is consistent with the establishment of infection resistance in uninfected cells. SIAT cells are a good in vitro model in which to study RSV in vivo dissemination, yielding similar infection timescales. However, the higher sensitivity of HEp-2 cells to RSV together with its RSV infectivity profile being similar to that of SIAT cells, makes HEp-2 cells more suitable for quantifying RSV infectivity over the course of in vitro RSV infections in SIAT cells. Our findings highlight the importance and urgency of resolving the mechanisms at play in the dissemination of RSV infections in vitro, and the processes by which this infectivity is lost.">

        <tr id="Anti-TNF drugs are frequently associated with serious Adverse Events (AEs), which necessitates an improved understanding of individual factors that determine efficacy and safety of anti-TNF agents. We mined the US FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) for anti-TNF-associated AEs to identify and stratify patient subgroups and drug combinations that exhibit specifically correlated complications. We demonstrate the existence of patient subgroup and anti-TNF agent-specific associations for relative risks of developing known and novel AEs including infections, edema, and organ damage associated processes. Concomitant use of anti-TNFs with corticosteroids significantly increased risk of AEs (p < 0.001) including pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary edema. Using these tightly correlated phenotypes, we mined mouse phenotype data to identify the molecular basis of these AEs. Multiple pathways and networks that regulate injury response, fluid regulation, and wound healing were implicated suggesting modification of anti-TNF-based therapeutic strategies to minimize corticosteroid-based combinatorial risk of severe AEs.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity is protective against viruses, but also can facilitate pathological infection responses. Despite intensive research, our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate innate immunity in virus infection remains incomplete. Systems biology-based data-driven modeling approaches hold substantial promise toward discovery of crucial innate immune signaling regulators, yet model-derived predictions are almost completely unexplored. Here, we carried out systematic experimental validation of candidate regulators predicted by a transcriptional association network model of influenza virus-infected cells. We identified dozens of novel innate immune signaling regulators with potent effects on the replication of influenza and other viruses, and importantly, we established the biological relevance of a validated regulator in vivo. Collectively, these findings aid in clarifying mechanisms of influenza virus pathogenicity and might lead to innovative approaches for treating influenza virus disease. Similar data-driven modeling strategies may be applicable for the study of other pathogen systems or immunological disorders.">

Methods for monitoring immunological markers in a host’s lungs are invasive and expensive, and some of them are not feasible to perform. ABSTRACT The tracking of pathogen burden and host responses with minimally invasive methods during respiratory infections is central for monitoring disease development and guiding treatment decisions. Utilizing a standardized murine model of respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we developed and tested different supervised machine learning models to predict viral burden and immune response markers, i.e., cytokines and leukocytes in the lung, from hematological data. We performed independently in vivo infection experiments to acquire extensive data for training and testing of the models. We show here that lung viral load, neutrophil counts, cytokines (such as gamma interferon [IFN-γ] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]), and other lung infection markers can be predicted from hematological data. Furthermore, feature analysis of the models showed that blood granulocytes and platelets play a crucial role in prediction and are highly involved in the immune response against IAV. The proposed in silico tools pave the path toward improved tracking and monitoring of influenza virus infections and possibly other respiratory infections based on minimally invasively obtained hematological parameters. IMPORTANCE During the course of respiratory infections such as influenza, we do have a very limited view of immunological indicators to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the outcome of a host. Methods for monitoring immunological markers in a host’s lungs are invasive and expensive, and some of them are not feasible to perform. Using machine learning algorithms, we show for the first time that minimally invasively acquired hematological parameters can be used to infer lung viral burden, leukocytes, and cytokines following influenza virus infection in mice. The potential of the framework proposed here consists of a new qualitative vision of the disease processes in the lung compartment as a noninvasive tool.">

        <tr id="Hundreds of immune cell types work in coordination to maintain tissue homeostasis. Upon infection, dramatic changes occur with the localization, migration, and proliferation of the immune cells to first alert the body of the danger, confine it to limit spreading, and finally extinguish the threat and bring the tissue back to homeostasis. Since current technologies can follow the dynamics of only a limited number of cell types, we have yet to grasp the full complexity of global in vivo cell dynamics in normal developmental processes and disease. Here, we devise a computational method, digital cell quantification (DCQ), which combines genome‐wide gene expression data with an immune cell compendium to infer in vivo changes in the quantities of 213 immune cell subpopulations. DCQ was applied to study global immune cell dynamics in mice lungs at ten time points during 7 days of flu infection. We find dramatic changes in quantities of 70 immune cell types, including various innate, adaptive, and progenitor immune cells. We focus on the previously unreported dynamics of four immune dendritic cell subtypes and suggest a specific role for CD103+ CD11b− DCs in early stages of disease and CD8+ pDC in late stages of flu infection.">

        <tr id="Ebola, one of the most pathogenic and lethal viruses, repeatedly leads to severe outbreaks with large numbers of casualties. By integration of data of fatal, non-fatal and asymptomatic cases, we developed a mathematical model of the immune response to Ebola infections and found that TNF-α can explain subsequent cytokine responses and allows to quantitatively stratify patients into survivors and fatal cases. The model further suggests that antibodies provide the key resolving mechanism in survivors while IFN-γ is the key defense mechanism in fatal cases. Exogenous IFN-γ and inhibition of excessive inflammation have the potential to rescue fatal Ebola infections in silico. In view of the high mortality of this disease, limited real life studies, and the unforeseeable next outbreak, our in silico analysis is meant as a guide for future research by the determination of the most efficient strategies for Ebola treatment.">

 Inflammation is common in virtually all diseases. Since immune cells travel through the blood to inflamed tissues, peripheral blood reflects inflammation at distant sites. However, blood biomarkers are hard to detect in global gene expression data since blood is not the site of perturbation and statistical corrections for multiple testing reduce sensitivity. We hypothesized that combining transcriptional signatures from inflamed tissue and machine learning would be useful to derive blood biomarkers. We first tested this in the mouse model of influenza infection. We identified a set of early genes in the lungs associated with lethality after infection. We then tested their differential abundance early in the blood of mice infected with a range of influenza doses. We applied elastic net to build a biomarker able to predict disease outcome (4 classes: early lethal, late lethal, non-lethal vs. non-infected; accuracy on training and validation sets: 91% and 79%). We next confirmed our hypothesis in lung cancer and breast cancer in humans. We identified sets of genes associated with tumors but not with tumor-free tissues and tested their differential abundance in the blood of patients compared to healthy controls. Using elastic net, we built two blood biomarkers to classify subjects according to disease status (case vs. control; accuracy on training and validation sets in breast cancer: 92% and 67%; in lung cancer: 89% and 78%). In conclusion, combining inflamed tissue signatures and machine learning, we were able to derive blood biomarkers for three different diseases in two different species. We expect that this novel strategy can be applied in other diseases as well.

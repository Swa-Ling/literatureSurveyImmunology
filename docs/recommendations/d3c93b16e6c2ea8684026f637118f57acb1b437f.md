        <tr id="During the course of respiratory infections such as influenza, we do have a very limited view of immunological indicators to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the outcome of a host. Methods for monitoring immunological markers in a host’s lungs are invasive and expensive, and some of them are not feasible to perform. ABSTRACT The tracking of pathogen burden and host responses with minimally invasive methods during respiratory infections is central for monitoring disease development and guiding treatment decisions. Utilizing a standardized murine model of respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we developed and tested different supervised machine learning models to predict viral burden and immune response markers, i.e., cytokines and leukocytes in the lung, from hematological data. We performed independently in vivo infection experiments to acquire extensive data for training and testing of the models. We show here that lung viral load, neutrophil counts, cytokines (such as gamma interferon [IFN-γ] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]), and other lung infection markers can be predicted from hematological data. Furthermore, feature analysis of the models showed that blood granulocytes and platelets play a crucial role in prediction and are highly involved in the immune response against IAV. The proposed in silico tools pave the path toward improved tracking and monitoring of influenza virus infections and possibly other respiratory infections based on minimally invasively obtained hematological parameters. IMPORTANCE During the course of respiratory infections such as influenza, we do have a very limited view of immunological indicators to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the outcome of a host. Methods for monitoring immunological markers in a host’s lungs are invasive and expensive, and some of them are not feasible to perform. Using machine learning algorithms, we show for the first time that minimally invasively acquired hematological parameters can be used to infer lung viral burden, leukocytes, and cytokines following influenza virus infection in mice. The potential of the framework proposed here consists of a new qualitative vision of the disease processes in the lung compartment as a noninvasive tool.">

 An organism’s immune system tries to protect it by identifying the presence of pathogens and attempting to eliminate them. The defense is twofold: innate immune cells mobilize rapidly, while acquired immune cells slowly develop into pathogen-killing specialists. These responses incur collateral tissue damage, which anti-inflammatory mediators seek to control. This system of checks and balances is responsible for host survival. Experimental research has demonstrated how vastly complex these interactions are, indicating a place for theoretical and computational study. In this work we develop a comprehensive differential equation model of the immune system by considering interactions between immune system components in the presence of pathogen or tissue trauma. Through this step-by-step construction we explore the dependence of the anti-inflammatory mediators on pathogen levels, and also how they temper the immune response at the end of infection. We then challenge the “virtual mouse” with typical pathogens of varying virulence and observe the outcomes via model simulation. We find that anti-inflammation can downregulate the activation and proliferation of immune cells or promote apoptosis as cessation mechanisms, suggesting the need for in vivo experiments. Bifurcation theory describes how the outcomes of infection depend on model parameters, from which we conclude that initial insult and pathogen growth rate allow us to predict whether or not the in silico mouse overcomes the disease in a deterministic framework.">

        <tr id="Many pathogens are able to manipulate the signaling pathways responsible for the generation of host immune responses. Here we examine and model a respiratory infection system in which disruption of host immune functions or of bacterial factors changes the dynamics of the infection. We synthesize the network of interactions between host immune components and two closely related bacteria in the genus Bordetellae. We incorporate existing experimental information on the timing of immune regulatory events into a discrete dynamic model, and verify the model by comparing the effects of simulated disruptions to the experimental outcome of knockout mutations. Our model indicates that the infection time course of both Bordetellae can be separated into three distinct phases based on the most active immune processes. We compare and discuss the effect of the species-specific virulence factors on disrupting the immune response during their infection of naive, antibody-treated, diseased, or convalescent hosts. Our model offers predictions regarding cytokine regulation, key immune components, and clearance of secondary infections; we experimentally validate two of these predictions. This type of modeling provides new insights into the virulence, pathogenesis, and host adaptation of disease-causing microorganisms and allows systems-level analysis that is not always possible using traditional methods.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity is protective against viruses, but also can facilitate pathological infection responses. Despite intensive research, our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate innate immunity in virus infection remains incomplete. Systems biology-based data-driven modeling approaches hold substantial promise toward discovery of crucial innate immune signaling regulators, yet model-derived predictions are almost completely unexplored. Here, we carried out systematic experimental validation of candidate regulators predicted by a transcriptional association network model of influenza virus-infected cells. We identified dozens of novel innate immune signaling regulators with potent effects on the replication of influenza and other viruses, and importantly, we established the biological relevance of a validated regulator in vivo. Collectively, these findings aid in clarifying mechanisms of influenza virus pathogenicity and might lead to innovative approaches for treating influenza virus disease. Similar data-driven modeling strategies may be applicable for the study of other pathogen systems or immunological disorders.">

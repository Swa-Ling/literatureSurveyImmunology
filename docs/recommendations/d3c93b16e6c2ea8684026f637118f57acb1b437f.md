Methods for monitoring immunological markers in a host’s lungs are invasive and expensive, and some of them are not feasible to perform. ABSTRACT The tracking of pathogen burden and host responses with minimally invasive methods during respiratory infections is central for monitoring disease development and guiding treatment decisions. Utilizing a standardized murine model of respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we developed and tested different supervised machine learning models to predict viral burden and immune response markers, i.e., cytokines and leukocytes in the lung, from hematological data. We performed independently in vivo infection experiments to acquire extensive data for training and testing of the models. We show here that lung viral load, neutrophil counts, cytokines (such as gamma interferon [IFN-γ] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]), and other lung infection markers can be predicted from hematological data. Furthermore, feature analysis of the models showed that blood granulocytes and platelets play a crucial role in prediction and are highly involved in the immune response against IAV. The proposed in silico tools pave the path toward improved tracking and monitoring of influenza virus infections and possibly other respiratory infections based on minimally invasively obtained hematological parameters. IMPORTANCE During the course of respiratory infections such as influenza, we do have a very limited view of immunological indicators to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the outcome of a host. Methods for monitoring immunological markers in a host’s lungs are invasive and expensive, and some of them are not feasible to perform. Using machine learning algorithms, we show for the first time that minimally invasively acquired hematological parameters can be used to infer lung viral burden, leukocytes, and cytokines following influenza virus infection in mice. The potential of the framework proposed here consists of a new qualitative vision of the disease processes in the lung compartment as a noninvasive tool.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viruses present major health challenges, as evidenced by the 2009 influenza pandemic and the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Severe RNA virus respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestation at the cell and tissue levels are vital to understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and developing improved, strain independent treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular spatial computational model of two principal components of tissue infection and response: RNA virus replication and type-I interferon mediated antiviral response to infection within lung epithelial cells. The model is parameterized using data from influenza virus infected cell cultures and, consistent with experimental observations, exhibits either linear radial growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons. Modulating the phosphorylation of STAT or altering the ratio of the diffusion constants of interferon and virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of arrest on diffusion constants highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for in vitro experiments to measure these diffusion constants. Sensitivity analyses were performed under conditions creating both continuous plaque growth and arrested plaque growth. Findings suggest that plaque growth and cytokine assay measurements should be collected during arrested plaque growth, as the model parameters are significantly more sensitive and more likely to be identifiable. The model’s metrics replicate experimental immunostaining imaging and titer based sampling assays. The model is easy to extend to include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms as they are discovered or to include as a component linking epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models. Author Summary COVID-19 is possibly the defining healthcare crisis of the current generation, with tens of millions of global cases and more than a million reported deaths. Respiratory lung infections form lesions in the lungs, whose number and size correlate with severity of illness. In some severe cases, the disease triggers a severe inflammatory condition known as cytokine storm. Given the complexity of the immune system, computational modeling is needed to link molecular signaling at the site of inflection to the signaling impact on the overall immune system, ultimately revealing how severe inflammatory conditions may emerge. Here, we created a computational model of the early stages of infection that simulates lung cells infected with RNA viruses, such those responsible for COVID-19 and influenza, to help explore how the disease forms viral plaques, an in vitro analog to lesion growth in the lung. Our model recapitulates in vitro observations that pretreatment of biological signaling molecules called with type-I interferons, which are currently being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Analyzing the model, we, can stop viral plaque growth. We found that enhancing certain aspects of the innate immune system, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, may be able to stop viral plaque growth, suggesting molecules involved in this pathway as possible drug candidates. Quantifying the parameters needed to model interferon signaling and viral replication, experiments should be performed under conditions that inhibit viral growth, such as pretreating cells with interferon. We present a computational framework that is essential to constructing larger models of respiratory infection induced immune responses, can be used to evaluate drugs and other medical interventions quickly, cheaply, and without the need for animal testing during the initial phase, and that defines experiments needed to improve our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms regulating the immune response.">

        <tr id="Many aspects of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are still poorly understood. Yet these knowledge gaps have had and could continue to have adverse, unintended consequences for the efficacy and safety of antivirals and vaccines developed against RSV. Mathematical modelling was used to test and evaluate hypotheses about the rate of loss of RSV infectivity and the mechanisms and kinetics of RSV infection spread in SIAT cells in vitro. While the rate of loss of RSV integrity, as measured via qRT-PCR, is well-described by an exponential decay, the latter mechanism failed to describe the rate at which RSV A Long loses infectivity over time in vitro based on the data presented herein. This is unusual given that other viruses (HIV, HCV, influenza) have been shown to lose their infectivity exponentially in vitro, and indeed an exponential rate of loss of infectivity is always assumed in mathematical modelling and experimental analyses. The infectivity profile of RSV in HEp-2 and SIAT cells remained consistent over the course of an RSV infection, over time and a large range of infectivity. However, SIAT cells were found to be ∼ 100× less sensitive to RSV infection than HEp-2 cells. In particular, we found that RSV spreads inefficiently in SIAT cells, in a manner we show is consistent with the establishment of infection resistance in uninfected cells. SIAT cells are a good in vitro model in which to study RSV in vivo dissemination, yielding similar infection timescales. However, the higher sensitivity of HEp-2 cells to RSV together with its RSV infectivity profile being similar to that of SIAT cells, makes HEp-2 cells more suitable for quantifying RSV infectivity over the course of in vitro RSV infections in SIAT cells. Our findings highlight the importance and urgency of resolving the mechanisms at play in the dissemination of RSV infections in vitro, and the processes by which this infectivity is lost.">

        <tr id="Many pathogens are able to manipulate the signaling pathways responsible for the generation of host immune responses. Here we examine and model a respiratory infection system in which disruption of host immune functions or of bacterial factors changes the dynamics of the infection. We synthesize the network of interactions between host immune components and two closely related bacteria in the genus Bordetellae. We incorporate existing experimental information on the timing of immune regulatory events into a discrete dynamic model, and verify the model by comparing the effects of simulated disruptions to the experimental outcome of knockout mutations. Our model indicates that the infection time course of both Bordetellae can be separated into three distinct phases based on the most active immune processes. We compare and discuss the effect of the species-specific virulence factors on disrupting the immune response during their infection of naive, antibody-treated, diseased, or convalescent hosts. Our model offers predictions regarding cytokine regulation, key immune components, and clearance of secondary infections; we experimentally validate two of these predictions. This type of modeling provides new insights into the virulence, pathogenesis, and host adaptation of disease-causing microorganisms and allows systems-level analysis that is not always possible using traditional methods.">

        <tr id="Ebola, one of the most pathogenic and lethal viruses, repeatedly leads to severe outbreaks with large numbers of casualties. By integration of data of fatal, non-fatal and asymptomatic cases, we developed a mathematical model of the immune response to Ebola infections and found that TNF-α can explain subsequent cytokine responses and allows to quantitatively stratify patients into survivors and fatal cases. The model further suggests that antibodies provide the key resolving mechanism in survivors while IFN-γ is the key defense mechanism in fatal cases. Exogenous IFN-γ and inhibition of excessive inflammation have the potential to rescue fatal Ebola infections in silico. In view of the high mortality of this disease, limited real life studies, and the unforeseeable next outbreak, our in silico analysis is meant as a guide for future research by the determination of the most efficient strategies for Ebola treatment.">

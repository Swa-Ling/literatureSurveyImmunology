 An organism’s immune system tries to protect it by identifying the presence of pathogens and attempting to eliminate them. The defense is twofold: innate immune cells mobilize rapidly, while acquired immune cells slowly develop into pathogen-killing specialists. These responses incur collateral tissue damage, which anti-inflammatory mediators seek to control. This system of checks and balances is responsible for host survival. Experimental research has demonstrated how vastly complex these interactions are, indicating a place for theoretical and computational study. In this work we develop a comprehensive differential equation model of the immune system by considering interactions between immune system components in the presence of pathogen or tissue trauma. Through this step-by-step construction we explore the dependence of the anti-inflammatory mediators on pathogen levels, and also how they temper the immune response at the end of infection. We then challenge the “virtual mouse” with typical pathogens of varying virulence and observe the outcomes via model simulation. We find that anti-inflammation can downregulate the activation and proliferation of immune cells or promote apoptosis as cessation mechanisms, suggesting the need for in vivo experiments. Bifurcation theory describes how the outcomes of infection depend on model parameters, from which we conclude that initial insult and pathogen growth rate allow us to predict whether or not the in silico mouse overcomes the disease in a deterministic framework.">

        <tr id="Many pathogens are able to manipulate the signaling pathways responsible for the generation of host immune responses. Here we examine and model a respiratory infection system in which disruption of host immune functions or of bacterial factors changes the dynamics of the infection. We synthesize the network of interactions between host immune components and two closely related bacteria in the genus Bordetellae. We incorporate existing experimental information on the timing of immune regulatory events into a discrete dynamic model, and verify the model by comparing the effects of simulated disruptions to the experimental outcome of knockout mutations. Our model indicates that the infection time course of both Bordetellae can be separated into three distinct phases based on the most active immune processes. We compare and discuss the effect of the species-specific virulence factors on disrupting the immune response during their infection of naive, antibody-treated, diseased, or convalescent hosts. Our model offers predictions regarding cytokine regulation, key immune components, and clearance of secondary infections; we experimentally validate two of these predictions. This type of modeling provides new insights into the virulence, pathogenesis, and host adaptation of disease-causing microorganisms and allows systems-level analysis that is not always possible using traditional methods.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity is protective against viruses, but also can facilitate pathological infection responses. Despite intensive research, our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate innate immunity in virus infection remains incomplete. Systems biology-based data-driven modeling approaches hold substantial promise toward discovery of crucial innate immune signaling regulators, yet model-derived predictions are almost completely unexplored. Here, we carried out systematic experimental validation of candidate regulators predicted by a transcriptional association network model of influenza virus-infected cells. We identified dozens of novel innate immune signaling regulators with potent effects on the replication of influenza and other viruses, and importantly, we established the biological relevance of a validated regulator in vivo. Collectively, these findings aid in clarifying mechanisms of influenza virus pathogenicity and might lead to innovative approaches for treating influenza virus disease. Similar data-driven modeling strategies may be applicable for the study of other pathogen systems or immunological disorders.">

        <tr id="Infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens exacerbate health care and economic burdens. Numerous viral biomolecules suppress the human innate immune system, enabling viruses to evade an immune response from the host. ABSTRACT Suppression of the host innate immune response is a critical aspect of viral replication. Upon infection, viruses may introduce one or more proteins that inhibit key immune pathways, such as the type I interferon pathway. However, the ability to predict and evaluate viral protein bioactivity on targeted pathways remains challenging and is typically done on a single-virus or -gene basis. Here, we present a medium-throughput high-content cell-based assay to reveal the immunosuppressive effects of viral proteins. To test the predictive power of our approach, we developed a library of 800 genes encoding known, predicted, and uncharacterized human virus genes. We found that previously known immune suppressors from numerous viral families such as Picornaviridae and Flaviviridae recorded positive responses. These include a number of viral proteases for which we further confirmed that innate immune suppression depends on protease activity. A class of predicted inhibitors encoded by Rhabdoviridae viruses was demonstrated to block nuclear transport, and several previously uncharacterized proteins from uncultivated viruses were shown to inhibit nuclear transport of the transcription factors NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). We propose that this pathway-based assay, together with early sequencing, gene synthesis, and viral infection studies, could partly serve as the basis for rapid in vitro characterization of novel viral proteins. IMPORTANCE Infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens exacerbate health care and economic burdens. Numerous viral biomolecules suppress the human innate immune system, enabling viruses to evade an immune response from the host. Despite our current understanding of viral replications and immune evasion, new viral proteins, including those encoded by uncultivated viruses or emerging viruses, are being unearthed at a rapid pace from large-scale sequencing and surveillance projects. The use of medium- and high-throughput functional assays to characterize immunosuppressive functions of viral proteins can advance our understanding of viral replication and possibly treatment of infections. In this study, we assembled a large viral-gene library from diverse viral families and developed a high-content assay to test for inhibition of innate immunity pathways. Our work expands the tools that can rapidly link sequence and protein function, representing a practical step toward early-stage evaluation of emerging and understudied viruses.">

        <tr id="Background Lipid metabolism pivotally contributes to the incidence and development of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The interaction of lipid metabolism and tumor microenvironment (TME) has become a new research direction. Methods Using the 1107 LUAD records from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, a comprehensive exploration was performed on the heterogeneous lipid metabolism subtypes based on lipid metabolism genes (LMGs) and immune-related genes (LRGs). The clinical significance, functional status, TME interaction and genomic changes of different subtypes were further studied. A new scoring system, lipid-immune score (LIS), was developed and validated. Results Two heterogeneous subtypes, which express more LMGs and show the characteristics of tumor metabolism and proliferation, are defined as lipid metabolism phenotypes. The prognosis of lipid metabolism phenotype is poor, and it is more common in patients with tumor progression. Expressing more IRGs, enrichment of immunoactive pathways and infiltration of effector immune cells are defined as immunoactive phenotypes. The immunoactive phenotype has a better prognosis and stronger anti-tumor immunity and is more sensitive to immunotherapy. In addition, KEAP1 is a driving mutant gene in the lipid metabolism subtype. Finally, LIS was developed and confirmed to be a robust predictor of overall survival (OS) and immunotherapy in LUAD patients. Conclusion Two heterogeneous subtypes of LUAD (lipid metabolism subtype and immune activity subtype) were identified to evaluate prognosis and immunotherapy sensitivity. Our research promotes the understanding of the interaction between lipid metabolism and TME and offers a novel direction for clinical management and precision therapy aimed to LUAD patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Non-small cell lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the world. Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer, has been well characterized as having a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, suggesting that the immune system plays an active role in shaping this cancer's growth and development. Despite these findings, our understanding of how this infiltrate affects patient prognosis and its association with lung adenocarcinoma-specific clinical factors remains limited. To address these questions, we inferred the infiltration level of six distinct immune cell types from a series of four lung adenocarcinoma gene expression datasets. We found that naive B cell, CD8+ T cell, and myeloid cell-derived expression signals of immune infiltration were significantly predictive of patient survival in multiple independent datasets, with B cell and CD8+ T cell infiltration associated with prolonged prognosis and myeloid cell infiltration associated with shorter survival. These associations remained significant even after accounting for additional clinical variables. Patients stratified by smoking status exhibited decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration and altered prognostic associations, suggesting potential immunosuppressive mechanisms in smokers. Survival analyses accounting for immune checkpoint gene expression and cellular immune infiltrate indicated checkpoint protein-specific modulatory effects on CD8+ T cell and B cell function that may be associated with patient sensitivity to immunotherapy. Together, these analyses identified reproducible associations that can be used to better characterize the role of immune infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma and demonstrate the utility in using computational approaches to systematically characterize tissue-specific tumor-immune interactions.">

        <tr id="This study explores migrasomes' role in neuroblastoma, a common malignant tumor in children, and their potential impact on tumor formation. We analyzed neuroblastoma RNA-seq datasets from public databases, including GSE62564, GSE181559, target, and fwr144. Through data normalization and unsupervised classification using migrasome-specific molecular markers, Differentially Expressed Genes were identified, followed by functional enrichment analysis. Our novel migrasome-associated machine learning model, MigScore, was developed using ten algorithms and 101 combinations, validated on two single-cell datasets. This enabled immune infiltration assessment and drug compatibility prediction, highlighting the utility of MS275, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Results showed a significant inverse relationship between MigScore and favorable clinical outcomes, elucidating the link between migrasome pathways and tumor immunogenicity. These findings suggest that migrasomes are crucial in neuroblastoma prognosis, leading to the possibility of personalized treatment strategies and improved outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Efferocytosis (ER) refers to the process of phagocytic clearance of programmed dead cells, and studies have shown that it is closely related to tumor immune escape. Methods This study was based on a comprehensive analysis of TCGA, GEO and CTRP databases. ER-related genes were collected from previous literature, univariate Cox regression was performed and consistent clustering was performed to categorize lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients into two subgroups. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to construct ER-related prognostic features, and multiple immune infiltration algorithms were used to assess the correlation between the extracellular burial-related risk score (ERGRS) and tumor microenvironment (TME). And the key gene HAVCR1 was identified by deep learning, etc. Finally, pan-cancer analysis of the key genes was performed and in vitro experiments were conducted to verify the promotional effect of HAVCR1 on LUAD progression. Results A total of 33 ER-related genes associated with the prognosis of LUAD were identified, and the prognostic signature of ERGRS was successfully constructed to predict the overall survival (OS) and treatment response of LUAD patients. The high-risk group was highly enriched in some oncogenic pathways, while the low-ERGRS group was highly enriched in some immune-related pathways. In addition, the high ERGRS group had higher TMB, TNB and TIDE scores and lower immune scores. The low-risk group had better immunotherapeutic response and less likelihood of immune escape. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that BRD-K92856060, monensin and hexaminolevulinate may be potential therapeutic agents for the high-risk group. And ERGRS was validated in several cohorts. In addition, HAVCR1 is one of the key genes, and knockdown of HAVCR1 in vitro significantly reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Conclusion Our study developed a novel prognostic signature of efferocytosis-related genes. This prognostic signature accurately predicted survival prognosis as well as treatment outcome in LUAD patients and explored the role of HAVCR1 in lung adenocarcinoma progression.

        <tr id="Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), featured by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and regional epidemiology, is curable when detected early, but highly lethal at an advanced stage. The molecular mechanism of NPC progression toward a clinically uncontrollable stage remains elusive. In this study, we developed a novel computational framework to conduct multiscale transcriptomic analysis during NPC progression. The framework consists of four modules enabling transcriptomic analyses spanning from single-cell, bulk, microenvironment, to cohort scales. The bulk-transcriptomic analysis of 133 NPC or normal samples unraveled leading functional enrichments of cell-cycle acceleration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and chemokine-modulated inflammatory response during NPC progression. The chemokine CXCL10 in the NPC microenvironment, discovered by single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis, recruits cytotoxic T cells through interacting with its receptor CXCR3 at early but late stages. This T-cell mistrafficking was featured by the decline of cytotoxic T cells and the increase of regulatory T cells, accompanied with B-cell depletion confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining. The featured immunomodulatory chemokines were commonly upregulated in the majority of cancers associated with viral or bacterial infections.">

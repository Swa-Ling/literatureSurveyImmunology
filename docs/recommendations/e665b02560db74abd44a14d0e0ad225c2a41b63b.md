        <tr id="Abstract Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer‐related mortality worldwide. Early detection and a comprehensive understanding of tumor‐immune interactions are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to develop a novel biomarker panel utilizing peripheral blood transcriptomics and machine learning algorithms for early lung cancer diagnosis, while simultaneously providing insights into tumor‐immune crosstalk mechanisms. Leveraging a training cohort (GSE135304), we employed multiple machine learning algorithms to formulate a Lung Cancer Diagnostic Score (LCDS) based on peripheral blood transcriptomic features. The LCDS model's performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) in multiple validation cohorts (GSE42834, GSE157086, and an in‐house dataset). Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 20 lung cancer patients and 10 healthy control subjects, representing an in‐house cohort recruited at the Sixth People's Hospital of Chengdu. We employed advanced bioinformatics techniques to explore tumor‐immune interactions through comprehensive immune infiltration and pathway enrichment analyses. Initial screening identified 844 differentially expressed genes, which were subsequently refined to 87 genes using the Boruta feature selection algorithm. The random forest (RF) algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy in constructing the LCDS model, yielding a mean AUC of 0.938. Lower LCDS values were significantly associated with elevated immune scores and increased CD4+ and CD8+ T‐cell infiltration, indicative of enhanced antitumor‐immune responses. Higher LCDS scores correlated with activation of hypoxia, peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor (PPAR), and Toll‐like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, as well as reduced DNA damage repair pathway scores. Our study presents a novel, machine learning‐derived peripheral blood transcriptomic biomarker panel with potential applications in early lung cancer diagnosis. The LCDS model not only demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing lung cancer patients from healthy individuals but also offers valuable insights into tumor‐immune interactions and underlying cancer biology. This approach may facilitate early lung cancer detection and contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying tumor‐immune crosstalk. Furthermore, our findings on the relationship between LCDS and immune infiltration patterns may have implications for future research on therapeutic strategies targeting the immune system in lung cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Lipid metabolism pivotally contributes to the incidence and development of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The interaction of lipid metabolism and tumor microenvironment (TME) has become a new research direction. Methods Using the 1107 LUAD records from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, a comprehensive exploration was performed on the heterogeneous lipid metabolism subtypes based on lipid metabolism genes (LMGs) and immune-related genes (LRGs). The clinical significance, functional status, TME interaction and genomic changes of different subtypes were further studied. A new scoring system, lipid-immune score (LIS), was developed and validated. Results Two heterogeneous subtypes, which express more LMGs and show the characteristics of tumor metabolism and proliferation, are defined as lipid metabolism phenotypes. The prognosis of lipid metabolism phenotype is poor, and it is more common in patients with tumor progression. Expressing more IRGs, enrichment of immunoactive pathways and infiltration of effector immune cells are defined as immunoactive phenotypes. The immunoactive phenotype has a better prognosis and stronger anti-tumor immunity and is more sensitive to immunotherapy. In addition, KEAP1 is a driving mutant gene in the lipid metabolism subtype. Finally, LIS was developed and confirmed to be a robust predictor of overall survival (OS) and immunotherapy in LUAD patients. Conclusion Two heterogeneous subtypes of LUAD (lipid metabolism subtype and immune activity subtype) were identified to evaluate prognosis and immunotherapy sensitivity. Our research promotes the understanding of the interaction between lipid metabolism and TME and offers a novel direction for clinical management and precision therapy aimed to LUAD patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Non-small cell lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the world. Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer, has been well characterized as having a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, suggesting that the immune system plays an active role in shaping this cancer's growth and development. Despite these findings, our understanding of how this infiltrate affects patient prognosis and its association with lung adenocarcinoma-specific clinical factors remains limited. To address these questions, we inferred the infiltration level of six distinct immune cell types from a series of four lung adenocarcinoma gene expression datasets. We found that naive B cell, CD8+ T cell, and myeloid cell-derived expression signals of immune infiltration were significantly predictive of patient survival in multiple independent datasets, with B cell and CD8+ T cell infiltration associated with prolonged prognosis and myeloid cell infiltration associated with shorter survival. These associations remained significant even after accounting for additional clinical variables. Patients stratified by smoking status exhibited decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration and altered prognostic associations, suggesting potential immunosuppressive mechanisms in smokers. Survival analyses accounting for immune checkpoint gene expression and cellular immune infiltrate indicated checkpoint protein-specific modulatory effects on CD8+ T cell and B cell function that may be associated with patient sensitivity to immunotherapy. Together, these analyses identified reproducible associations that can be used to better characterize the role of immune infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma and demonstrate the utility in using computational approaches to systematically characterize tissue-specific tumor-immune interactions.">

        <tr id="Background In recent years, the immunotherapy of lung adenocarcinoma has developed rapidly, but the good therapeutic effect only exists in some patients, and most of the current predictors cannot predict it very well. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages have been reported to play a crucial role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Thus, we want to build novel molecular markers based on macrophages. Methods By non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm and Cox regression analysis, we constructed macrophage-related subtypes of LUAD patients and built a novel gene signature consisting of 12 differentially expressed genes between two subtypes. The gene signature was further validated in Gene-Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Its predictive effect on prognosis and immunotherapy outcome was further evaluated with rounded analyses. We finally explore the role of TRIM28 in LUAD with a series of in vitro experiments. Results Our research indicated that a higher LMS score was significantly correlated with tumor staging, pathological grade, tumor node metastasis stage, and survival. LMS was identified as an independent risk factor for OS in LUAD patients and verified in GEO datasets. Clinical response to immunotherapy was better in patients with low LMS score compared to those with high LMS score. TRIM28, a key gene in the gene signature, was shown to promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of LUAD cell. Conclusion Our study highlights the significant role of gene signature in predicting the prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy of LUAD patients, and identifies TRIM28 as a potential biomarker for the treatment of LUAD.">

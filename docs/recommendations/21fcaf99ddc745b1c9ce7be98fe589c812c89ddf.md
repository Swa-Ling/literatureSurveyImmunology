        <tr id="The brain needs more energy than other organs in the body. Mitochondria are the generator of vital power in the living organism. Not only do mitochondria sense signals from the outside of a cell, but they also orchestrate the cascade of subcellular events by supplying adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the biochemical energy. It is known that impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress contribute or lead to neuronal damage and degeneration of the brain. This mini-review focuses on addressing how mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we discuss state-of-the-art computational models of mitochondrial functions in relation to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Together, a better understanding of brain disease-specific mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress can pave the way to developing antioxidant therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neuronal activity and prevent neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe neurological disorder with a pathogenesis that remains incompletely understood. Recently, a novel form of cell death known as disulfidptosis has garnered significant attention in the field of ischemic stroke research. This study aims to investigate the mechanistic roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in the context of IS and to examine their correlation with immunopathological features. Methods To enhance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of disulfidptosis in IS, we initially retrieved the expression profile of peripheral blood from human IS patients from the GEO database. We then utilized a suite of machine learning algorithms, including LASSO, random forest, and SVM-RFE, to identify and validate pivotal genes. Furthermore, we developed a predictive nomogram model, integrating multifactorial logistic regression analysis and calibration curves, to evaluate the risk of IS. For the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, we employed a range of analytical tools, such as "Monocle" and "CellChat," to assess the status of immune cell infiltration and to characterize intercellular communication networks. Additionally, we utilized an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) model to investigate the effects of SLC7A11 overexpression on microglial polarization. Results This study successfully identified key genes associated with disulfidptosis and developed a reliable nomogram model using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of ischemic stroke. Examination of single-cell sequencing data showed a robust correlation between disulfidptosis levels and the infiltration of immune cells. Furthermore, "CellChat" analysis elucidated the intricate characteristics of intercellular communication networks. Notably, the TNF signaling pathway was found to be intimately linked with the disulfidptosis signature in ischemic stroke. In an intriguing finding, the OGD model demonstrated that SLC7A11 expression suppresses M1 polarization while promoting M2 polarization in microglia. Conclusion The significance of our findings lies in their potential to shed light on the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, particularly by underscoring the pivotal role of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs). These insights could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting DRGs to mitigate the impact of ischemic stroke.

        <tr id="Astrocytes and microglia react to Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. Single-nuclei and single-cell RNA-seq have revealed multiple states or subpopulations of these glial cells but lack spatial information. We have developed a methodology of cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry on human postmortem brains and image analysis that enables a comprehensive morphological quantitative characterization of astrocytes and microglia in the context of their spatial relationships with plaques and tangles. Single FFPE sections from the temporal association cortex of control and AD subjects were subjected to 8 cycles of multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry, including 7 astroglial, 6 microglial, 1 neuronal, Aβ, and phospho-tau markers. Our analysis pipeline consisted of: (1) image alignment across cycles; (2) background subtraction; (3) manual annotation of 5172 ALDH1L1+ astrocytic and 6226 IBA1+ microglial profiles; (4) local thresholding and segmentation of profiles; (5) machine learning on marker intensity data; and (6) deep learning on image features. Spectral clustering identified three phenotypes of astrocytes and microglia, which we termed “homeostatic,” “intermediate,” and “reactive.” Reactive and, to a lesser extent, intermediate astrocytes and microglia were closely associated with AD pathology (≤ 50 µm). Compared to homeostatic, reactive astrocytes contained substantially higher GFAP and YKL-40, modestly elevated vimentin and TSPO as well as EAAT1, and reduced GS. Intermediate astrocytes had markedly increased EAAT2, moderately increased GS, and intermediate GFAP and YKL-40 levels. Relative to homeostatic, reactive microglia showed increased expression of all markers (CD68, ferritin, MHC2, TMEM119, TSPO), whereas intermediate microglia exhibited increased ferritin and TMEM119 as well as intermediate CD68 levels. Machine learning models applied on either high-plex signal intensity data (gradient boosting machines) or directly on image features (convolutional neural networks) accurately discriminated control vs. AD diagnoses at the single-cell level. Cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry combined with machine learning models holds promise to advance our understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of glial responses as well as inform transcriptomics studies. Three distinct phenotypes emerged with our combination of markers, thus expanding the classic binary “homeostatic vs. reactive” classification to a third state, which could represent “transitional” or “resilient” glia.">

        <tr id="Microglia are the immune cell in the central nervous system (CNS) and exist in a surveillant state characterized by a ramified form in the healthy brain. In response to brain injury or disease including neurodegenerative diseases, they become activated and change their morphology. Due to known correlation between this activation and neuroinflammation, there is great interest in improved approaches for studying microglial activation in the context of CNS disease mechanisms. One classic approach has utilized Microglia's morphology as one of the key indicators of its activation and correlated with its functional state. More recently microglial activation has been shown to have intrinsic NADH metabolic signatures that are detectable via fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Despite the promise of morphology and metabolism as key fingerprints of microglial function, they has not been analyzed together due to lack of an appropriate computational framework. Here we present a deep neural network to study the effect of both morphology and FLIM metabolic signatures toward identifying its activation status. Our model is tested on 1, 000+ cells (ground truth generated using LPS treatment) and provides a state-of-the-art framework to identify microglial activation and its role in neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
A multitude of high-quality imaging modalities exist that provide structural data at unprecedented levels of detail. Tissue ultrastructure greatly influences the rate of transport of proteins and other molecules that contribute to neurodegeneration. However, our ability to model flow and diffusion processes in the brain lags behind the quality of the neuroimaging data. Here, a new framework will be presented for converting neuroimaging data into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in a scalable manner suitable for high performance computing. TEM data from the Allen Institute will illustrate its capabilities.


METHODS
Segmented TEM images were downloaded from the MicronsExplorer public storage cache. Segmented image stack volumes (4 × 4 × 4 µm) were converted into surface meshes using the Lewiner Marching Cubes algorithm. Convection and diffusion along the surface of individual cells was modeled. After each timestep mass was allowed to exchange between neighboring cells, implemented on a high performance computing cluster using the MPI protocol on 40 or more computing cores. Multiple volumes were analyzed simultaneously, with updates of the flux between cells in different volumes occurring at each time step. These steps were performed with new custom CFD code written in C and Julia.


RESULTS
Segmented z-stacks of TEM data from the MICrONS Explorer website were downloaded in 4 × 4 × 4 µm blocks, which typically contain ≈500 distinct cells (Fig. 1A&B). The meshing algorithm leads to perfect matching between adjacent cells (Fig. 1C). The convection-diffusion equations are solved, modeling flow/diffusion of solutes between cells (Fig. 1D&E). Equations are solved for all ≈500 distinct cells in parallel, with concentrations at matching faces re-balanced at each time step (Fig. 2A&B). A manager-worker MPI model allows for solution on an arbitrary number of cores (Fig. 2C). The interfaces between cell surfaces across volumes are also perfectly matched, allowing for adjustment of the flux of mass between volumes at each timestep (Fig. 2D).


CONCLUSIONS
A new modeling framework is described for solution of transport equations on high performance computing clusters for any imaging modality that produces segmented z-stacked images.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis is crucial in neuronal cell death, associated with various neurological disorders. However, the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in ischaemic stroke (IS) has yet to be well elucidated. We downloaded IS-related gene information and FRGs from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Ferritin databases (FerrDb). 22 IS-related DE-FRGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes involve multiple regulatory pathways related to IS pathogenesis, including redox, amino acid metabolism, and cell cycle. Subsequently, DUOX2, MDM2, EGFR, MAP3K14, and TRIM46 were identified as core marker genes among the 22 DE-FRGs by lasso and SVM-RFE algorithms. The construction of the nomogram using the five marker genes had excellent diagnostic value. In addition, CIBERSORT analysis showed that changes in the immune microenvironment of IS patients might be associated with TRIM46, MDM2, and DUOX2. In addition, a total of 66 drugs targeting two characteristic FRGs were obtained. The ceRNA networks revealed complex regulatory relationships based on characteristic FRGs. These findings provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of IS.">

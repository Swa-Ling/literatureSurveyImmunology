        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe neurological disorder with a pathogenesis that remains incompletely understood. Recently, a novel form of cell death known as disulfidptosis has garnered significant attention in the field of ischemic stroke research. This study aims to investigate the mechanistic roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in the context of IS and to examine their correlation with immunopathological features. Methods To enhance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of disulfidptosis in IS, we initially retrieved the expression profile of peripheral blood from human IS patients from the GEO database. We then utilized a suite of machine learning algorithms, including LASSO, random forest, and SVM-RFE, to identify and validate pivotal genes. Furthermore, we developed a predictive nomogram model, integrating multifactorial logistic regression analysis and calibration curves, to evaluate the risk of IS. For the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, we employed a range of analytical tools, such as "Monocle" and "CellChat," to assess the status of immune cell infiltration and to characterize intercellular communication networks. Additionally, we utilized an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) model to investigate the effects of SLC7A11 overexpression on microglial polarization. Results This study successfully identified key genes associated with disulfidptosis and developed a reliable nomogram model using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of ischemic stroke. Examination of single-cell sequencing data showed a robust correlation between disulfidptosis levels and the infiltration of immune cells. Furthermore, "CellChat" analysis elucidated the intricate characteristics of intercellular communication networks. Notably, the TNF signaling pathway was found to be intimately linked with the disulfidptosis signature in ischemic stroke. In an intriguing finding, the OGD model demonstrated that SLC7A11 expression suppresses M1 polarization while promoting M2 polarization in microglia. Conclusion The significance of our findings lies in their potential to shed light on the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, particularly by underscoring the pivotal role of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs). These insights could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting DRGs to mitigate the impact of ischemic stroke.

        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke (IS) represents a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality globally. The relationship between IS and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) was presently uncertain. This study endeavors to explore the fundamental mechanism of UPRmt in IS by utilizing bioinformatics methods. Methods In GSE58294, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained, which were overlapped with key module genes of UPRmt -related gene ( UPRmt -RGs) for producing candidate genes. The biomarkers were identified from the candidate genes through machine learning, expression validation, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In order to verify the biomarkers, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments were performed on human peripheral blood. Subsequently, a predictive nomogram was created to estimate the likelihood of developing IS. Next, the mechanisms and functions related to the biomarkers were explored by enrichment analysis and immune infiltration. In addition, cells enriched with biomarkers were identified, and the biological processes involved in these cells were analyzed through intercellular communication analysis and virtual knockout experiments. Results MCEMP1, CACNA1E, and CLEC4D were identified as biomarkers and subsequently validated by RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR revealed that CLEC4D is the most sensitive biomarker. The nomogram analysis revealed that these biomarkers possess strong diagnostic value. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that all three biomarkers are strongly correlated with neutrophils. Additionally, in the single-cell transcriptome data, these biomarkers were predominantly enriched in neutrophils. Compared to the sham group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group exhibited enhanced immune-inflammatory responses. Virtual knockout experiments provide preliminary evidence that CLEC4D functions as a regulatory molecule in neutrophil-mediated inflammation, rather than serving merely as a passive marker. Conclusion CLEC4D was identified as the most sensitive biomarker for IS related to UPRmt -RGs, offering a new reference for IS diagnosis and treatment.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis is crucial in neuronal cell death, associated with various neurological disorders. However, the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in ischaemic stroke (IS) has yet to be well elucidated. We downloaded IS-related gene information and FRGs from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Ferritin databases (FerrDb). 22 IS-related DE-FRGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes involve multiple regulatory pathways related to IS pathogenesis, including redox, amino acid metabolism, and cell cycle. Subsequently, DUOX2, MDM2, EGFR, MAP3K14, and TRIM46 were identified as core marker genes among the 22 DE-FRGs by lasso and SVM-RFE algorithms. The construction of the nomogram using the five marker genes had excellent diagnostic value. In addition, CIBERSORT analysis showed that changes in the immune microenvironment of IS patients might be associated with TRIM46, MDM2, and DUOX2. In addition, a total of 66 drugs targeting two characteristic FRGs were obtained. The ceRNA networks revealed complex regulatory relationships based on characteristic FRGs. These findings provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of IS.">

        <tr id="Neuroimmune responses by astrocytes and microglia play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Reactive astrocytes have diverse responses to triggers and can release a wide variety of effector molecules in an insult‐specific manner. Identifying key mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis in large datasets is key to finding new therapeutic targets, but the interpretation of such datasets is challenging. Causal biological network (CBNs) models assemble available biological knowledge in a structured computable format that facilitates mechanistic interpretation of molecular data in a well‐defined biological context. Here, we present a CBN model of pan‐reactive astrogliosis genes as a new tool to explore and quantify the extent of reactive astrogliosis based on transcriptomic data and identify key molecular drivers of the phenotype.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes play a central role in the neuroimmune response by responding to CNS pathologies with diverse molecular and morphological changes during the process of reactive astrogliosis. Here, we used a computational biological network model and mathematical algorithms that allow the interpretation of high-throughput transcriptomic datasets in the context of known biology to study reactive astrogliosis. We gathered available mechanistic information from the literature into a comprehensive causal biological network (CBN) model of astrocyte reactivity. The CBN model was built in the Biological Expression Language, which is both human-readable and computable. We characterized the CBN with a network analysis of highly connected nodes and demonstrated that the CBN captures relevant astrocyte biology. Subsequently, we used the CBN and transcriptomic data to identify key molecular pathways driving the astrocyte phenotype in four CNS pathologies: samples from mouse models of lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and samples from multiple sclerosis patients. The astrocyte CBN provides a new tool to identify causal mechanisms and quantify astrogliosis based on transcriptomic data.">

        <tr id="Microglia are the immune cell in the central nervous system (CNS) and exist in a surveillant state characterized by a ramified form in the healthy brain. In response to brain injury or disease including neurodegenerative diseases, they become activated and change their morphology. Due to known correlation between this activation and neuroinflammation, there is great interest in improved approaches for studying microglial activation in the context of CNS disease mechanisms. One classic approach has utilized Microglia's morphology as one of the key indicators of its activation and correlated with its functional state. More recently microglial activation has been shown to have intrinsic NADH metabolic signatures that are detectable via fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Despite the promise of morphology and metabolism as key fingerprints of microglial function, they has not been analyzed together due to lack of an appropriate computational framework. Here we present a deep neural network to study the effect of both morphology and FLIM metabolic signatures toward identifying its activation status. Our model is tested on 1, 000+ cells (ground truth generated using LPS treatment) and provides a state-of-the-art framework to identify microglial activation and its role in neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), specific brain regions become vulnerable to pathology while others remain resilient. New methods of imaging such as highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) provide an abundance of spatial information, while analytical techniques like machine learning (ML) can address questions of cellular contributors to this regional vulnerability.


METHOD
We performed MxIF staining for 26 markers and compared postmortem human samples from an AD-susceptible brain area, the prefrontal cortex (PFC, Brodmann's areas 9, 10 or 46) to an AD-resilient brain area, the primary visual cortex (V1, area 17). Subjects included AD (n = 3, clinical dementia rating CDR 3, Thal stages 3-4, Braak stages V-VI), mild cognitive impairment (n = 4, CDR 0.5, Thal stages 1-3, Braak stages I-V), and age-matched healthy controls (n = 5, CDR 0, Thal stages 0-1, Braak stages I-II), including both females and males. We first used a custom Fiji plugin that leverages iterative ML to segment the images via DAPI or HUD signals. For the DAPI segmentation, ML subsequently classifies the cell type based on relevant channels. The second method used QuPath to segment exclusively using DAPI signal followed by cell-type classifications. Segmentations and classifications in QuPath used static thresholds.


RESULT
Using Fiji for HUD segmentation and filtering by the presence of nuclei, we found a decrease specifically in layer 5 PFC neurons from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Surprisingly, this decrease did not hold in QuPath when segmenting first using DAPI. Both methods found an increase in GFAP-expressing astrocytes primarily in layer 1. However, the pan-astrocyte marker ALDH1L1 showed an inverse relationship, with higher density found in layers 2 through 6. Both findings held true regardless of brain region or CDR. Finally, in addition to the white matter, both methods found an increase in oligodendrocytes (MBP+, MBP+/HUD+) within layer 4 of V1 and driven by CDR 0.5.


CONCLUSION
Comparisons between the image analysis modalities demonstrate that the method by which cells are segmented and classified can impact the interpretation of MxIF data. Combining knowledge of disease biology with a deeper understanding of when and how to use these techniques will improve data precision.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis is crucial in neuronal cell death, associated with various neurological disorders. However, the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in ischaemic stroke (IS) has yet to be well elucidated. We downloaded IS-related gene information and FRGs from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Ferritin databases (FerrDb). 22 IS-related DE-FRGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes involve multiple regulatory pathways related to IS pathogenesis, including redox, amino acid metabolism, and cell cycle. Subsequently, DUOX2, MDM2, EGFR, MAP3K14, and TRIM46 were identified as core marker genes among the 22 DE-FRGs by lasso and SVM-RFE algorithms. The construction of the nomogram using the five marker genes had excellent diagnostic value. In addition, CIBERSORT analysis showed that changes in the immune microenvironment of IS patients might be associated with TRIM46, MDM2, and DUOX2. In addition, a total of 66 drugs targeting two characteristic FRGs were obtained. The ceRNA networks revealed complex regulatory relationships based on characteristic FRGs. These findings provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of IS.">

        <tr id="Neuroimmune responses by astrocytes and microglia play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Reactive astrocytes have diverse responses to triggers and can release a wide variety of effector molecules in an insult‐specific manner. Identifying key mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis in large datasets is key to finding new therapeutic targets, but the interpretation of such datasets is challenging. Causal biological network (CBNs) models assemble available biological knowledge in a structured computable format that facilitates mechanistic interpretation of molecular data in a well‐defined biological context. Here, we present a CBN model of pan‐reactive astrogliosis genes as a new tool to explore and quantify the extent of reactive astrogliosis based on transcriptomic data and identify key molecular drivers of the phenotype.">

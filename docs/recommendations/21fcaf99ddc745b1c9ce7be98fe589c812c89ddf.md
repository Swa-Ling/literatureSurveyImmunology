        <tr id="The brain needs more energy than other organs in the body. Mitochondria are the generator of vital power in the living organism. Not only do mitochondria sense signals from the outside of a cell, but they also orchestrate the cascade of subcellular events by supplying adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the biochemical energy. It is known that impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress contribute or lead to neuronal damage and degeneration of the brain. This mini-review focuses on addressing how mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we discuss state-of-the-art computational models of mitochondrial functions in relation to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Together, a better understanding of brain disease-specific mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress can pave the way to developing antioxidant therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neuronal activity and prevent neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Microglia are the immune cell in the central nervous system (CNS) and exist in a surveillant state characterized by a ramified form in the healthy brain. In response to brain injury or disease including neurodegenerative diseases, they become activated and change their morphology. Due to known correlation between this activation and neuroinflammation, there is great interest in improved approaches for studying microglial activation in the context of CNS disease mechanisms. One classic approach has utilized Microglia's morphology as one of the key indicators of its activation and correlated with its functional state. More recently microglial activation has been shown to have intrinsic NADH metabolic signatures that are detectable via fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Despite the promise of morphology and metabolism as key fingerprints of microglial function, they has not been analyzed together due to lack of an appropriate computational framework. Here we present a deep neural network to study the effect of both morphology and FLIM metabolic signatures toward identifying its activation status. Our model is tested on 1, 000+ cells (ground truth generated using LPS treatment) and provides a state-of-the-art framework to identify microglial activation and its role in neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), specific brain regions become vulnerable to pathology while others remain resilient. New methods of imaging such as highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) provide an abundance of spatial information, while analytical techniques like machine learning (ML) can address questions of cellular contributors to this regional vulnerability.


METHOD
We performed MxIF staining for 26 markers and compared postmortem human samples from an AD-susceptible brain area, the prefrontal cortex (PFC, Brodmann's areas 9, 10 or 46) to an AD-resilient brain area, the primary visual cortex (V1, area 17). Subjects included AD (n = 3, clinical dementia rating CDR 3, Thal stages 3-4, Braak stages V-VI), mild cognitive impairment (n = 4, CDR 0.5, Thal stages 1-3, Braak stages I-V), and age-matched healthy controls (n = 5, CDR 0, Thal stages 0-1, Braak stages I-II), including both females and males. We first used a custom Fiji plugin that leverages iterative ML to segment the images via DAPI or HUD signals. For the DAPI segmentation, ML subsequently classifies the cell type based on relevant channels. The second method used QuPath to segment exclusively using DAPI signal followed by cell-type classifications. Segmentations and classifications in QuPath used static thresholds.


RESULT
Using Fiji for HUD segmentation and filtering by the presence of nuclei, we found a decrease specifically in layer 5 PFC neurons from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Surprisingly, this decrease did not hold in QuPath when segmenting first using DAPI. Both methods found an increase in GFAP-expressing astrocytes primarily in layer 1. However, the pan-astrocyte marker ALDH1L1 showed an inverse relationship, with higher density found in layers 2 through 6. Both findings held true regardless of brain region or CDR. Finally, in addition to the white matter, both methods found an increase in oligodendrocytes (MBP+, MBP+/HUD+) within layer 4 of V1 and driven by CDR 0.5.


CONCLUSION
Comparisons between the image analysis modalities demonstrate that the method by which cells are segmented and classified can impact the interpretation of MxIF data. Combining knowledge of disease biology with a deeper understanding of when and how to use these techniques will improve data precision.">

        <tr id="Neuroimmune responses by astrocytes and microglia play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Reactive astrocytes have diverse responses to triggers and can release a wide variety of effector molecules in an insult‐specific manner. Identifying key mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis in large datasets is key to finding new therapeutic targets, but the interpretation of such datasets is challenging. Causal biological network (CBNs) models assemble available biological knowledge in a structured computable format that facilitates mechanistic interpretation of molecular data in a well‐defined biological context. Here, we present a CBN model of pan‐reactive astrogliosis genes as a new tool to explore and quantify the extent of reactive astrogliosis based on transcriptomic data and identify key molecular drivers of the phenotype.">

        <tr id="As rapid responders to their environments, microglia engage in functions that are mirrored by their cellular morphology. Microglia are classically thought to exhibit a ramified morphology under homeostatic conditions which switches to an ameboid form during inflammatory conditions. However, microglia display a wide spectrum of morphologies outside of this dichotomy, including rod-like, ramified, ameboid, and hypertrophic states, which have been observed across brain regions, neurodevelopmental timepoints, and various pathological contexts. We used dimensionality reduction and clustering approaches to consider contributions of multiple morphology measures together to define a spectrum of microglial morphological states. Using ImageJ tools, we first developed a semi-automated approach to characterize 27 morphology features from hundreds to thousands of individual microglial cells in a brain subregion-specific manner. Within this pool of morphology measures, we defined distinct sets of highly correlated features that describe different aspects of morphology, including branch length, branching complexity, territory span, and cell circularity. When considered together, these sets of features drove different morphological clusters. Furthermore, our analysis toolset captured morphological states similarly and robustly when applied to independent datasets and using different immunofluorescent markers for microglia. We have compiled our morphology analysis pipeline into an accessible, easy to use, and fully open-source ImageJ macro and R package that the neuroscience community can expand upon and directly apply to their own analyses. Outcomes from this work will supply the field with new tools to systematically evaluate the heterogeneity of microglia morphological states across various experimental models and research questions.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes play an important role in various processes in the brain, including pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have shown that the increase in saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid (PA) triggers pro-inflammatory pathways in the brain. The use of synthetic neurosteroids such as tibolone has demonstrated neuro-protective mechanisms. However, broad studies, with a systemic point of view on the neurodegenerative role of PA and the neuro-protective mechanisms of tibolone are lacking. In this study, we performed the integration of multi-omic data (transcriptome and proteome) into a human astrocyte genomic scale metabolic model to study the astrocytic response during palmitate treatment. We evaluated metabolic fluxes in three scenarios (healthy, induced inflammation by PA, and tibolone treatment under PA inflammation). We also applied a control theory approach to identify those reactions that exert more control in the astrocytic system. Our results suggest that PA generates a modulation of central and secondary metabolism, showing a switch in energy source use through inhibition of folate cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation and upregulation of ketone bodies formation. We found 25 metabolic switches under PA-mediated cellular regulation, 9 of which were critical only in the inflammatory scenario but not in the protective tibolone one. Within these reactions, inhibitory, total, and directional coupling profiles were key findings, playing a fundamental role in the (de)regulation in metabolic pathways that may increase neurotoxicity and represent potential treatment targets. Finally, the overall framework of our approach facilitates the understanding of complex metabolic regulation, and it can be used for in silico exploration of the mechanisms of astrocytic cell regulation, directing a more complex future experimental work in neurodegenerative diseases.">

Not only do mitochondria sense signals from the outside of a cell, but they also orchestrate the cascade of subcellular events by supplying adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the biochemical energy. It is known that impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress contribute or lead to neuronal damage and degeneration of the brain. This mini-review focuses on addressing how mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we discuss state-of-the-art computational models of mitochondrial functions in relation to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Together, a better understanding of brain disease-specific mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress can pave the way to developing antioxidant therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neuronal activity and prevent neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe neurological disorder with a pathogenesis that remains incompletely understood. Recently, a novel form of cell death known as disulfidptosis has garnered significant attention in the field of ischemic stroke research. This study aims to investigate the mechanistic roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in the context of IS and to examine their correlation with immunopathological features. To enhance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of disulfidptosis in IS, we initially retrieved the expression profile of peripheral blood from human IS patients from the GEO database. We then utilized a suite of machine learning algorithms, including LASSO, random forest, and SVM-RFE, to identify and validate pivotal genes. Furthermore, we developed a predictive nomogram model, integrating multifactorial logistic regression analysis and calibration curves, to evaluate the risk of IS. For the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, we employed a range of analytical tools, such as "Monocle" and "CellChat," to assess the status of immune cell infiltration and to characterize intercellular communication networks. Additionally, we utilized an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) model to investigate the effects of SLC7A11 overexpression on microglial polarization. This study successfully identified key genes associated with disulfidptosis and developed a reliable nomogram model using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of ischemic stroke. Examination of single-cell sequencing data showed a robust correlation between disulfidptosis levels and the infiltration of immune cells. Furthermore, "CellChat" analysis elucidated the intricate characteristics of intercellular communication networks. Notably, the TNF signaling pathway was found to be intimately linked with the disulfidptosis signature in ischemic stroke. In an intriguing finding, the OGD model demonstrated that SLC7A11 expression suppresses M1 polarization while promoting M2 polarization in microglia. The significance of our findings lies in their potential to shed light on the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, particularly by underscoring the pivotal role of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs). These insights could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting DRGs to mitigate the impact of ischemic stroke.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Ischemic Stroke (IS) represents the most prevalent subtype of cerebrovascular disease, characterized by complex pathophysiological mechanisms that remain inadequately characterized, particularly concerning mitochondrial dysfunctions. These mitochondrial impairments are increasingly recognized as contributory factors in IS pathogenesis, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms involved.


METHODS
In this study, we integrated transcriptomic datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the comprehensive MitoCarta3.0 mitochondrial proteome inventory to elucidate the role of dysregulated Mitochondrial-Related Genes (MRGs) in IS. We employed an advanced bioinformatics and machine learning pipeline, incorporating differential expression profiling alongside network-based prioritization using CytoHubba. Rigorous feature selection was conducted through LASSO regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to derive a robust core MRG signature. Our methodology included training and validation cohorts to construct diagnostic models, which were critically evaluated via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, nomograms, and calibration analyses.


RESULTS
Our analysis identified a seven-gene signature comprising DNAJA3, ACSL1, HSDL2, ECHDC2, ECHDC3, ALDH2, and PDK4, which demonstrated significant correlation with activated CD8+ T-cell and natural killer cell infiltration. Furthermore, integrative network analyses revealed intricate regulatory interactions among MRGs, microRNAs, and transcription factors. Notably, drug-target predictions indicated Bezafibrate as a promising therapeutic agent for modulating mitochondrial homeostasis in the context of IS.


DISCUSSION
These findings offer a novel framework for ischemic stroke diagnosis and therapy, yet their computational derivation underscores the need for thorough experimental validation of MRGs and drug candidates, along with the integration of diverse clinical data to confirm their real-world applicability.


CONCLUSION
Our findings underscore mitochondrial dysfunction not only as a critical factor in IS pathogenesis but also as a viable therapeutic target. The identified MRG signature presents potential for clinical application in diagnostic and pharmacological strategies aimed at ameliorating ischemic injury. This study highlights the translational significance of systems biology approaches within cerebrovascular medicine, warranting further mechanistic exploration of mitochondrial-immune interactions in stroke pathology.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
A multitude of high-quality imaging modalities exist that provide structural data at unprecedented levels of detail. Tissue ultrastructure greatly influences the rate of transport of proteins and other molecules that contribute to neurodegeneration. However, our ability to model flow and diffusion processes in the brain lags behind the quality of the neuroimaging data. Here, a new framework will be presented for converting neuroimaging data into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in a scalable manner suitable for high performance computing. TEM data from the Allen Institute will illustrate its capabilities.


METHODS
Segmented TEM images were downloaded from the MicronsExplorer public storage cache. Segmented image stack volumes (4 × 4 × 4 µm) were converted into surface meshes using the Lewiner Marching Cubes algorithm. Convection and diffusion along the surface of individual cells was modeled. After each timestep mass was allowed to exchange between neighboring cells, implemented on a high performance computing cluster using the MPI protocol on 40 or more computing cores. Multiple volumes were analyzed simultaneously, with updates of the flux between cells in different volumes occurring at each time step. These steps were performed with new custom CFD code written in C and Julia.


RESULTS
Segmented z-stacks of TEM data from the MICrONS Explorer website were downloaded in 4 × 4 × 4 µm blocks, which typically contain ≈500 distinct cells (Fig. 1A&B). The meshing algorithm leads to perfect matching between adjacent cells (Fig. 1C). The convection-diffusion equations are solved, modeling flow/diffusion of solutes between cells (Fig. 1D&E). Equations are solved for all ≈500 distinct cells in parallel, with concentrations at matching faces re-balanced at each time step (Fig. 2A&B). A manager-worker MPI model allows for solution on an arbitrary number of cores (Fig. 2C). The interfaces between cell surfaces across volumes are also perfectly matched, allowing for adjustment of the flux of mass between volumes at each timestep (Fig. 2D).


CONCLUSIONS
A new modeling framework is described for solution of transport equations on high performance computing clusters for any imaging modality that produces segmented z-stacked images.">

        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke (IS) represents a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality globally. The relationship between IS and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) was presently uncertain. This study endeavors to explore the fundamental mechanism of UPRmt in IS by utilizing bioinformatics methods. Methods In GSE58294, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained, which were overlapped with key module genes of UPRmt -related gene ( UPRmt -RGs) for producing candidate genes. The biomarkers were identified from the candidate genes through machine learning, expression validation, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In order to verify the biomarkers, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments were performed on human peripheral blood. Subsequently, a predictive nomogram was created to estimate the likelihood of developing IS. Next, the mechanisms and functions related to the biomarkers were explored by enrichment analysis and immune infiltration. In addition, cells enriched with biomarkers were identified, and the biological processes involved in these cells were analyzed through intercellular communication analysis and virtual knockout experiments. Results MCEMP1, CACNA1E, and CLEC4D were identified as biomarkers and subsequently validated by RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR revealed that CLEC4D is the most sensitive biomarker. The nomogram analysis revealed that these biomarkers possess strong diagnostic value. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that all three biomarkers are strongly correlated with neutrophils. Additionally, in the single-cell transcriptome data, these biomarkers were predominantly enriched in neutrophils. Compared to the sham group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group exhibited enhanced immune-inflammatory responses. Virtual knockout experiments provide preliminary evidence that CLEC4D functions as a regulatory molecule in neutrophil-mediated inflammation, rather than serving merely as a passive marker. Conclusion CLEC4D was identified as the most sensitive biomarker for IS related to UPRmt -RGs, offering a new reference for IS diagnosis and treatment.">

Manual assessment of such a broad literature base is daunting. We performed a comprehensive informatics-based systematic review or ‘field analysis’ to agnostically compute and map the current state of the field. Text mining of recaptured articles was used to quantify published data topic breadth and frequency. We constructed a nine-category pathophysiological function-based ontology to systematically organize and quantify the field's primary data. Results demonstrated that the distribution of primary research belonging to each category is: systemic measures an motor function, 59%; inflammation, 46%; cellular energetics, 37%; proteomics, 31%; neural excitability, 22%; apoptosis, 20%; oxidative stress, 18%; aberrant cellular chemistry, 14%; axonal transport, 10%. We constructed a SOD1-G93A field map that visually illustrates and categorizes the 85% most frequently assessed sub-topics. Finally, we present the literature-cited significance of frequently published terms and uncover thinly investigated areas. In conclusion, most articles individually examine at least two categories, which is indicative of the numerous underlying pathophysiological interrelationships. An essential future path is examination of cross-category pathophysiological interrelationships and their co-correspondence to homeostatic regulation and disease progression.">

However, the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in ischaemic stroke (IS) has yet to be well elucidated. We downloaded IS-related gene information and FRGs from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Ferritin databases (FerrDb). 22 IS-related DE-FRGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes involve multiple regulatory pathways related to IS pathogenesis, including redox, amino acid metabolism, and cell cycle. Subsequently, DUOX2, MDM2, EGFR, MAP3K14, and TRIM46 were identified as core marker genes among the 22 DE-FRGs by lasso and SVM-RFE algorithms. The construction of the nomogram using the five marker genes had excellent diagnostic value. In addition, CIBERSORT analysis showed that changes in the immune microenvironment of IS patients might be associated with TRIM46, MDM2, and DUOX2. In addition, a total of 66 drugs targeting two characteristic FRGs were obtained. The ceRNA networks revealed complex regulatory relationships based on characteristic FRGs.

        <tr id="The brain needs more energy than other organs in the body. Mitochondria are the generator of vital power in the living organism. Not only do mitochondria sense signals from the outside of a cell, but they also orchestrate the cascade of subcellular events by supplying adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the biochemical energy. It is known that impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress contribute or lead to neuronal damage and degeneration of the brain. This mini-review focuses on addressing how mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we discuss state-of-the-art computational models of mitochondrial functions in relation to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Together, a better understanding of brain disease-specific mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress can pave the way to developing antioxidant therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neuronal activity and prevent neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
A multitude of high-quality imaging modalities exist that provide structural data at unprecedented levels of detail. Tissue ultrastructure greatly influences the rate of transport of proteins and other molecules that contribute to neurodegeneration. However, our ability to model flow and diffusion processes in the brain lags behind the quality of the neuroimaging data. Here, a new framework will be presented for converting neuroimaging data into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in a scalable manner suitable for high performance computing. TEM data from the Allen Institute will illustrate its capabilities.


METHODS
Segmented TEM images were downloaded from the MicronsExplorer public storage cache. Segmented image stack volumes (4 × 4 × 4 µm) were converted into surface meshes using the Lewiner Marching Cubes algorithm. Convection and diffusion along the surface of individual cells was modeled. After each timestep mass was allowed to exchange between neighboring cells, implemented on a high performance computing cluster using the MPI protocol on 40 or more computing cores. Multiple volumes were analyzed simultaneously, with updates of the flux between cells in different volumes occurring at each time step. These steps were performed with new custom CFD code written in C and Julia.


RESULTS
Segmented z-stacks of TEM data from the MICrONS Explorer website were downloaded in 4 × 4 × 4 µm blocks, which typically contain ≈500 distinct cells (Fig. 1A&B). The meshing algorithm leads to perfect matching between adjacent cells (Fig. 1C). The convection-diffusion equations are solved, modeling flow/diffusion of solutes between cells (Fig. 1D&E). Equations are solved for all ≈500 distinct cells in parallel, with concentrations at matching faces re-balanced at each time step (Fig. 2A&B). A manager-worker MPI model allows for solution on an arbitrary number of cores (Fig. 2C). The interfaces between cell surfaces across volumes are also perfectly matched, allowing for adjustment of the flux of mass between volumes at each timestep (Fig. 2D).


CONCLUSIONS
A new modeling framework is described for solution of transport equations on high performance computing clusters for any imaging modality that produces segmented z-stacked images.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), specific brain regions become vulnerable to pathology while others remain resilient. New methods of imaging such as highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) provide an abundance of spatial information, while analytical techniques like machine learning (ML) can address questions of cellular contributors to this regional vulnerability.


METHOD
We performed MxIF staining for 26 markers and compared postmortem human samples from an AD-susceptible brain area, the prefrontal cortex (PFC, Brodmann's areas 9, 10 or 46) to an AD-resilient brain area, the primary visual cortex (V1, area 17). Subjects included AD (n = 3, clinical dementia rating CDR 3, Thal stages 3-4, Braak stages V-VI), mild cognitive impairment (n = 4, CDR 0.5, Thal stages 1-3, Braak stages I-V), and age-matched healthy controls (n = 5, CDR 0, Thal stages 0-1, Braak stages I-II), including both females and males. We first used a custom Fiji plugin that leverages iterative ML to segment the images via DAPI or HUD signals. For the DAPI segmentation, ML subsequently classifies the cell type based on relevant channels. The second method used QuPath to segment exclusively using DAPI signal followed by cell-type classifications. Segmentations and classifications in QuPath used static thresholds.


RESULT
Using Fiji for HUD segmentation and filtering by the presence of nuclei, we found a decrease specifically in layer 5 PFC neurons from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Surprisingly, this decrease did not hold in QuPath when segmenting first using DAPI. Both methods found an increase in GFAP-expressing astrocytes primarily in layer 1. However, the pan-astrocyte marker ALDH1L1 showed an inverse relationship, with higher density found in layers 2 through 6. Both findings held true regardless of brain region or CDR. Finally, in addition to the white matter, both methods found an increase in oligodendrocytes (MBP+, MBP+/HUD+) within layer 4 of V1 and driven by CDR 0.5.


CONCLUSION
Comparisons between the image analysis modalities demonstrate that the method by which cells are segmented and classified can impact the interpretation of MxIF data. Combining knowledge of disease biology with a deeper understanding of when and how to use these techniques will improve data precision.">

Manual assessment of such a broad literature base is daunting. We performed a comprehensive informatics-based systematic review or ‘field analysis’ to agnostically compute and map the current state of the field. Text mining of recaptured articles was used to quantify published data topic breadth and frequency. We constructed a nine-category pathophysiological function-based ontology to systematically organize and quantify the field's primary data. Results demonstrated that the distribution of primary research belonging to each category is: systemic measures an motor function, 59%; inflammation, 46%; cellular energetics, 37%; proteomics, 31%; neural excitability, 22%; apoptosis, 20%; oxidative stress, 18%; aberrant cellular chemistry, 14%; axonal transport, 10%. We constructed a SOD1-G93A field map that visually illustrates and categorizes the 85% most frequently assessed sub-topics. Finally, we present the literature-cited significance of frequently published terms and uncover thinly investigated areas. In conclusion, most articles individually examine at least two categories, which is indicative of the numerous underlying pathophysiological interrelationships. An essential future path is examination of cross-category pathophysiological interrelationships and their co-correspondence to homeostatic regulation and disease progression.">

This renders cell omics seemingly, like the universe, expand with no limit and our goal toward the complete harness of the cellular system merely impossible. Therefore, it is imperative to review what has been done and is being done to predict what can be done toward the translation of omics information to disease control with minimal cell perturbation. With a focus on the “four big omics,” i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, we delineate hierarchies of these omics together with their epiomics and interactomics, and review technologies developed for interrogation. We predict, among others, redoxomics as an emerging omics layer that views cell decision toward the physiological or pathological state as a fine-tuned redox balance.">

        <tr id="Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a debilitating disorder that impacts all systems of the body and has been increasing in prevalence throughout the globe. DM represents a significant clinical challenge to care for individuals and prevent the onset of chronic disability and ultimately death. Underlying cellular mechanisms for the onset and development of DM are multi-factorial in origin and involve pathways associated with the production of reactive oxygen species and the generation of oxidative stress as well as the dysfunction of mitochondrial cellular organelles, programmed cell death, and circadian rhythm impairments. These pathways can ultimately involve failure in the glymphatic pathway of the brain that is linked to circadian rhythms disorders during the loss of metabolic homeostasis. New studies incorporate a number of promising techniques to examine patients with metabolic disorders that can include machine learning and artificial intelligence pathways to potentially predict the onset of metabolic dysfunction.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are increasingly recognized for their role in cognitive decline and the progression of neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite advances in imaging technologies, the exact contribution of WMHs to disease processes remains a subject of ongoing research. This study aims to apply machine learning approaches to determine critical features of AD-related neuropathologies in vivo.


METHODS
A total of 65 participants (17 females, mean age = 79.0) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included. In the ADNI dataset, machine learning models were applied towards feature selection of MRI, clinical, and demographic data to identify the best performing set of variables that could predict neuropathology outcomes [e.g., Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage, Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD) neuritic plaque, etc.]. The best-performing neuropathology predictors using the top seven MRI, clinical, and demographic features were selected. For continuous measures, gradient boosting, bagging, support vector regression, and linear regression were implemented. For binary outcomes, logistic regression, gradient boosting, support vector machine, and bagging classifiers were utilized.


RESULTS
Four machine learning models applying feature ranking methods using similar information criteria consistently ranked WMHs as important features in predicting all neuropathology measures. In the ADNI dataset, prediction accuracy was highest for Braak stage, CERAD neuritic palques, and diffuse plaques (i.e., cross-validated correlation between actual measures and predictions was above 0.8). The best-performing model achieved over r = 0.85 correlation in predicting Braak.


CONCLUSION
These results highlight the importance of WMHs as core features of AD and the benefits of using machine learning models that incorporate WMH burden in predicting AD-related neuropathologies. The use of machine learning may prove beneficial in early detection of AD.">

        <tr id="The brain needs more energy than other organs in the body. Mitochondria are the generator of vital power in the living organism. Not only do mitochondria sense signals from the outside of a cell, but they also orchestrate the cascade of subcellular events by supplying adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the biochemical energy. It is known that impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress contribute or lead to neuronal damage and degeneration of the brain. This mini-review focuses on addressing how mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we discuss state-of-the-art computational models of mitochondrial functions in relation to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Together, a better understanding of brain disease-specific mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress can pave the way to developing antioxidant therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neuronal activity and prevent neurodegeneration.">

Manual assessment of such a broad literature base is daunting. We performed a comprehensive informatics-based systematic review or ‘field analysis’ to agnostically compute and map the current state of the field. Text mining of recaptured articles was used to quantify published data topic breadth and frequency. We constructed a nine-category pathophysiological function-based ontology to systematically organize and quantify the field's primary data. Results demonstrated that the distribution of primary research belonging to each category is: systemic measures an motor function, 59%; inflammation, 46%; cellular energetics, 37%; proteomics, 31%; neural excitability, 22%; apoptosis, 20%; oxidative stress, 18%; aberrant cellular chemistry, 14%; axonal transport, 10%. We constructed a SOD1-G93A field map that visually illustrates and categorizes the 85% most frequently assessed sub-topics. Finally, we present the literature-cited significance of frequently published terms and uncover thinly investigated areas. In conclusion, most articles individually examine at least two categories, which is indicative of the numerous underlying pathophysiological interrelationships. An essential future path is examination of cross-category pathophysiological interrelationships and their co-correspondence to homeostatic regulation and disease progression.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The Trail Making Test (TMT) is one of the tests most commonly included in neuropsychological batteries to assess executive functions. A digitized version of TMT would provide objective measurements of time to complete (TTC) and total number of errors (TE) with minimal training, and eventually enable process metrics including detailed evaluation of drawing behavior. Here we evaluated the test-retest reliability and validity of a new digital TMT Part B (dTMT-B).


METHOD
We examined cognitively unimpaired participants from two clinical trials: DCT216 (N = 182, age mean±SD = 64.8±7.5; 60% female; years of education mean±SD = 14.4±2.5; 20% Hispanic; 3-5 weeks between tests) and Bio-Hermes-001 (N = 342, age mean±SD = 70.5±6.4; 63% female; years of education mean[IQR] = 16[14-23]; 6% Hispanic). For both TTC and TE, reliability was assessed via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 3, k) in DCT216. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. We assessed validity by combining visit 1 of DCT216 and Bio-Hermes-001 and performing a multiple linear regression predicting TTC using predictors for study, age, sex, education, ethnicity, and interactions between study and each demographic. Specifically, we calculated the coefficients for age (key demographic in paper-based TMT) and for demographic performance across both studies.


RESULT
ICCs showed great reliability for TTC (0.87, 95% CI = 0.83 - 0.90, p < 0.0001) and good reliability for TE (0.65, 95% CI = 0.53 - 0.74, p < 0.0001). Cronbach's alpha showed good internal consistency across these metrics as well (0.68). For validity, we found the expected significant main effect of age (T = 7.48, p < 0.001) and no significant interactions (p > 0.05), suggesting similar trends with paper-based TMT-B and consistent TTC values across studies.


CONCLUSION
dTMT-B is a valid and reliable digital implementation of the commonly used, paper-based TMT Part B.">

It is difficult to define the complexity of neuro-system quantitatively or meaningfully from a system standpoint. Thus, inclined towards the progress in developing new and effective therapeutic intervention, it is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanism and significance of neuro system and their complex molecular interaction. A biomarker discovery is an important need for early disease diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of new therapy for neurological disorders. The emergence of system biology and network-based computational model approaches provides the underlying molecular mechanism and significance of disease and their complex molecular interaction. Thus, it becomes quite easy to understand the specific nature of neuro system as well as it plays a significant role in integrating the omics data at multiple levels that lead to key success in the development of more accurate and efficient biomarker for neurological disorders. The current review focused on significant contributions of system biology and network-based computational model approaches in biomarker discovery with special reference to neurological disorders.">

        <tr id="Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and widespread disruptions in brain function. Computational modeling has advanced our understanding of these processes, but efforts have traditionally focused on either neuronal dynamics or the underlying biological mechanisms of disease. One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain frameworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network stability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease progression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, and glial responses and vascular mechanisms. Each modeling tradition has provided important insights, but experimental evidence shows these processes are interconnected: neuronal activity modulates protein release and clearance, while pathological burden feeds back to disrupt circuit function. Modeling these domains in isolation limits our understanding. To determine where and why disease emerges, how it spreads, and how it might be altered, we must develop integrated frameworks that capture feedback between neuronal dynamics and disease biology. In this review, we survey the two modeling approaches and highlight efforts to unify them. We argue that such integration is necessary to address key questions in neurodegeneration and to inform interventions, from targeted stimulation to control-theoretic strategies that slow progression and restore function.">

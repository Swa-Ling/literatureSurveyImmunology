        <tr id="Astrocytes play an important role in various processes in the brain, including pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have shown that the increase in saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid (PA) triggers pro-inflammatory pathways in the brain. The use of synthetic neurosteroids such as tibolone has demonstrated neuro-protective mechanisms. However, broad studies, with a systemic point of view on the neurodegenerative role of PA and the neuro-protective mechanisms of tibolone are lacking. In this study, we performed the integration of multi-omic data (transcriptome and proteome) into a human astrocyte genomic scale metabolic model to study the astrocytic response during palmitate treatment. We evaluated metabolic fluxes in three scenarios (healthy, induced inflammation by PA, and tibolone treatment under PA inflammation). We also applied a control theory approach to identify those reactions that exert more control in the astrocytic system. Our results suggest that PA generates a modulation of central and secondary metabolism, showing a switch in energy source use through inhibition of folate cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation and upregulation of ketone bodies formation. We found 25 metabolic switches under PA-mediated cellular regulation, 9 of which were critical only in the inflammatory scenario but not in the protective tibolone one. Within these reactions, inhibitory, total, and directional coupling profiles were key findings, playing a fundamental role in the (de)regulation in metabolic pathways that may increase neurotoxicity and represent potential treatment targets. Finally, the overall framework of our approach facilitates the understanding of complex metabolic regulation, and it can be used for in silico exploration of the mechanisms of astrocytic cell regulation, directing a more complex future experimental work in neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="The brain needs more energy than other organs in the body. Mitochondria are the generator of vital power in the living organism. Not only do mitochondria sense signals from the outside of a cell, but they also orchestrate the cascade of subcellular events by supplying adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the biochemical energy. It is known that impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress contribute or lead to neuronal damage and degeneration of the brain. This mini-review focuses on addressing how mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we discuss state-of-the-art computational models of mitochondrial functions in relation to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Together, a better understanding of brain disease-specific mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress can pave the way to developing antioxidant therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neuronal activity and prevent neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes and microglia react to Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. Single-nuclei and single-cell RNA-seq have revealed multiple states or subpopulations of these glial cells but lack spatial information. We have developed a methodology of cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry on human postmortem brains and image analysis that enables a comprehensive morphological quantitative characterization of astrocytes and microglia in the context of their spatial relationships with plaques and tangles. Single FFPE sections from the temporal association cortex of control and AD subjects were subjected to 8 cycles of multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry, including 7 astroglial, 6 microglial, 1 neuronal, Aβ, and phospho-tau markers. Our analysis pipeline consisted of: (1) image alignment across cycles; (2) background subtraction; (3) manual annotation of 5172 ALDH1L1+ astrocytic and 6226 IBA1+ microglial profiles; (4) local thresholding and segmentation of profiles; (5) machine learning on marker intensity data; and (6) deep learning on image features. Spectral clustering identified three phenotypes of astrocytes and microglia, which we termed “homeostatic,” “intermediate,” and “reactive.” Reactive and, to a lesser extent, intermediate astrocytes and microglia were closely associated with AD pathology (≤ 50 µm). Compared to homeostatic, reactive astrocytes contained substantially higher GFAP and YKL-40, modestly elevated vimentin and TSPO as well as EAAT1, and reduced GS. Intermediate astrocytes had markedly increased EAAT2, moderately increased GS, and intermediate GFAP and YKL-40 levels. Relative to homeostatic, reactive microglia showed increased expression of all markers (CD68, ferritin, MHC2, TMEM119, TSPO), whereas intermediate microglia exhibited increased ferritin and TMEM119 as well as intermediate CD68 levels. Machine learning models applied on either high-plex signal intensity data (gradient boosting machines) or directly on image features (convolutional neural networks) accurately discriminated control vs. AD diagnoses at the single-cell level. Cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry combined with machine learning models holds promise to advance our understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of glial responses as well as inform transcriptomics studies. Three distinct phenotypes emerged with our combination of markers, thus expanding the classic binary “homeostatic vs. reactive” classification to a third state, which could represent “transitional” or “resilient” glia.">

Manual assessment of such a broad literature base is daunting. We performed a comprehensive informatics-based systematic review or ‘field analysis’ to agnostically compute and map the current state of the field. Text mining of recaptured articles was used to quantify published data topic breadth and frequency. We constructed a nine-category pathophysiological function-based ontology to systematically organize and quantify the field's primary data. Results demonstrated that the distribution of primary research belonging to each category is: systemic measures an motor function, 59%; inflammation, 46%; cellular energetics, 37%; proteomics, 31%; neural excitability, 22%; apoptosis, 20%; oxidative stress, 18%; aberrant cellular chemistry, 14%; axonal transport, 10%. We constructed a SOD1-G93A field map that visually illustrates and categorizes the 85% most frequently assessed sub-topics. Finally, we present the literature-cited significance of frequently published terms and uncover thinly investigated areas. In conclusion, most articles individually examine at least two categories, which is indicative of the numerous underlying pathophysiological interrelationships. An essential future path is examination of cross-category pathophysiological interrelationships and their co-correspondence to homeostatic regulation and disease progression.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The Trail Making Test (TMT) is one of the tests most commonly included in neuropsychological batteries to assess executive functions. A digitized version of TMT would provide objective measurements of time to complete (TTC) and total number of errors (TE) with minimal training, and eventually enable process metrics including detailed evaluation of drawing behavior. Here we evaluated the test-retest reliability and validity of a new digital TMT Part B (dTMT-B).


METHOD
We examined cognitively unimpaired participants from two clinical trials: DCT216 (N = 182, age mean±SD = 64.8±7.5; 60% female; years of education mean±SD = 14.4±2.5; 20% Hispanic; 3-5 weeks between tests) and Bio-Hermes-001 (N = 342, age mean±SD = 70.5±6.4; 63% female; years of education mean[IQR] = 16[14-23]; 6% Hispanic). For both TTC and TE, reliability was assessed via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 3, k) in DCT216. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. We assessed validity by combining visit 1 of DCT216 and Bio-Hermes-001 and performing a multiple linear regression predicting TTC using predictors for study, age, sex, education, ethnicity, and interactions between study and each demographic. Specifically, we calculated the coefficients for age (key demographic in paper-based TMT) and for demographic performance across both studies.


RESULT
ICCs showed great reliability for TTC (0.87, 95% CI = 0.83 - 0.90, p < 0.0001) and good reliability for TE (0.65, 95% CI = 0.53 - 0.74, p < 0.0001). Cronbach's alpha showed good internal consistency across these metrics as well (0.68). For validity, we found the expected significant main effect of age (T = 7.48, p < 0.001) and no significant interactions (p > 0.05), suggesting similar trends with paper-based TMT-B and consistent TTC values across studies.


CONCLUSION
dTMT-B is a valid and reliable digital implementation of the commonly used, paper-based TMT Part B.">

        <tr id="Metabolic aberrations are a prominent feature of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Different neuronal subtypes have selective vulnerability in AD. Despite the recent advance of single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq of AD brains, genome-scale metabolic network changes in neuronal subtypes have not been systematically studied with detail. To bridge this knowledge gap, I developed a computational method called perturb-Met that can uncover transcriptional dysregulation centered at hundreds of metabolites in a metabolic network. perturb-Met successfully recapitulated known glycolysis, cholesterol, and other metabolic defects in APOE4-neurons and microglia, many of which are missed by current methods. Applying perturb-Met on AD snRNA-seq data, I revealed that the four neuronal subtypes in the entorhinal cortex shows subtype-specific metabolic changes, namely mitochondrial complex I metabolism, ganglioside metabolism, galactose and heparan sulfate metabolism, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, respectively. perturb-Met also revealed significant changes in protein glycosylation in the neuron subtype specifically found in AD brains. These subtype-specific metabolic changes may potentially underlie their selective vulnerability in AD. perturb-Met is a valuable tool to discover potential metabolic network changes in many other single cell or bulk transcriptomic studies.">

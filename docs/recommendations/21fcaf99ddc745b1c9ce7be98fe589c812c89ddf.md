        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe neurological disorder with a pathogenesis that remains incompletely understood. Recently, a novel form of cell death known as disulfidptosis has garnered significant attention in the field of ischemic stroke research. This study aims to investigate the mechanistic roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in the context of IS and to examine their correlation with immunopathological features. Methods To enhance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of disulfidptosis in IS, we initially retrieved the expression profile of peripheral blood from human IS patients from the GEO database. We then utilized a suite of machine learning algorithms, including LASSO, random forest, and SVM-RFE, to identify and validate pivotal genes. Furthermore, we developed a predictive nomogram model, integrating multifactorial logistic regression analysis and calibration curves, to evaluate the risk of IS. For the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, we employed a range of analytical tools, such as "Monocle" and "CellChat," to assess the status of immune cell infiltration and to characterize intercellular communication networks. Additionally, we utilized an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) model to investigate the effects of SLC7A11 overexpression on microglial polarization. Results This study successfully identified key genes associated with disulfidptosis and developed a reliable nomogram model using machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of ischemic stroke. Examination of single-cell sequencing data showed a robust correlation between disulfidptosis levels and the infiltration of immune cells. Furthermore, "CellChat" analysis elucidated the intricate characteristics of intercellular communication networks. Notably, the TNF signaling pathway was found to be intimately linked with the disulfidptosis signature in ischemic stroke. In an intriguing finding, the OGD model demonstrated that SLC7A11 expression suppresses M1 polarization while promoting M2 polarization in microglia. Conclusion The significance of our findings lies in their potential to shed light on the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, particularly by underscoring the pivotal role of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs). These insights could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting DRGs to mitigate the impact of ischemic stroke.

        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke (IS) represents a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality globally. The relationship between IS and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) was presently uncertain. This study endeavors to explore the fundamental mechanism of UPRmt in IS by utilizing bioinformatics methods. Methods In GSE58294, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained, which were overlapped with key module genes of UPRmt -related gene ( UPRmt -RGs) for producing candidate genes. The biomarkers were identified from the candidate genes through machine learning, expression validation, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In order to verify the biomarkers, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments were performed on human peripheral blood. Subsequently, a predictive nomogram was created to estimate the likelihood of developing IS. Next, the mechanisms and functions related to the biomarkers were explored by enrichment analysis and immune infiltration. In addition, cells enriched with biomarkers were identified, and the biological processes involved in these cells were analyzed through intercellular communication analysis and virtual knockout experiments. Results MCEMP1, CACNA1E, and CLEC4D were identified as biomarkers and subsequently validated by RT-qPCR. RT-qPCR revealed that CLEC4D is the most sensitive biomarker. The nomogram analysis revealed that these biomarkers possess strong diagnostic value. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that all three biomarkers are strongly correlated with neutrophils. Additionally, in the single-cell transcriptome data, these biomarkers were predominantly enriched in neutrophils. Compared to the sham group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group exhibited enhanced immune-inflammatory responses. Virtual knockout experiments provide preliminary evidence that CLEC4D functions as a regulatory molecule in neutrophil-mediated inflammation, rather than serving merely as a passive marker. Conclusion CLEC4D was identified as the most sensitive biomarker for IS related to UPRmt -RGs, offering a new reference for IS diagnosis and treatment.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
A multitude of high-quality imaging modalities exist that provide structural data at unprecedented levels of detail. Tissue ultrastructure greatly influences the rate of transport of proteins and other molecules that contribute to neurodegeneration. However, our ability to model flow and diffusion processes in the brain lags behind the quality of the neuroimaging data. Here, a new framework will be presented for converting neuroimaging data into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in a scalable manner suitable for high performance computing. TEM data from the Allen Institute will illustrate its capabilities.


METHODS
Segmented TEM images were downloaded from the MicronsExplorer public storage cache. Segmented image stack volumes (4 × 4 × 4 µm) were converted into surface meshes using the Lewiner Marching Cubes algorithm. Convection and diffusion along the surface of individual cells was modeled. After each timestep mass was allowed to exchange between neighboring cells, implemented on a high performance computing cluster using the MPI protocol on 40 or more computing cores. Multiple volumes were analyzed simultaneously, with updates of the flux between cells in different volumes occurring at each time step. These steps were performed with new custom CFD code written in C and Julia.


RESULTS
Segmented z-stacks of TEM data from the MICrONS Explorer website were downloaded in 4 × 4 × 4 µm blocks, which typically contain ≈500 distinct cells (Fig. 1A&B). The meshing algorithm leads to perfect matching between adjacent cells (Fig. 1C). The convection-diffusion equations are solved, modeling flow/diffusion of solutes between cells (Fig. 1D&E). Equations are solved for all ≈500 distinct cells in parallel, with concentrations at matching faces re-balanced at each time step (Fig. 2A&B). A manager-worker MPI model allows for solution on an arbitrary number of cores (Fig. 2C). The interfaces between cell surfaces across volumes are also perfectly matched, allowing for adjustment of the flux of mass between volumes at each timestep (Fig. 2D).


CONCLUSIONS
A new modeling framework is described for solution of transport equations on high performance computing clusters for any imaging modality that produces segmented z-stacked images.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis is crucial in neuronal cell death, associated with various neurological disorders. However, the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in ischaemic stroke (IS) has yet to be well elucidated. We downloaded IS-related gene information and FRGs from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Ferritin databases (FerrDb). 22 IS-related DE-FRGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes involve multiple regulatory pathways related to IS pathogenesis, including redox, amino acid metabolism, and cell cycle. Subsequently, DUOX2, MDM2, EGFR, MAP3K14, and TRIM46 were identified as core marker genes among the 22 DE-FRGs by lasso and SVM-RFE algorithms. The construction of the nomogram using the five marker genes had excellent diagnostic value. In addition, CIBERSORT analysis showed that changes in the immune microenvironment of IS patients might be associated with TRIM46, MDM2, and DUOX2. In addition, a total of 66 drugs targeting two characteristic FRGs were obtained. The ceRNA networks revealed complex regulatory relationships based on characteristic FRGs. These findings provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of IS.">

        <tr id="This study employs machine learning and single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to unearth novel biomarkers and delineate the immune characteristics of ischemic stroke (IS), thereby contributing fresh insights into IS treatment strategies.Our research leverages gene expression data sourced from the GEO database. We undertake weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to filter pertinent genes and subsequently employ machine learning algorithms for the identification of feature genes. Concurrently, we rigorously execute quality control measures, dimensionality reduction techniques, and cell annotation on the scRNA-seq data to pinpoint differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The identification of core genes, denoted as Hub genes, among the feature genes and DEGs, is achieved through meticulous overlapping analysis. We illuminate the immune characteristics of these Hub genes using a suite of analytical tools, encompassing CIBERSORT, MCPcounter, and pseudotemporal analysis, all based on immune cell annotations and single-cell transcriptome data.Subsequently, we harness the CMap database to prognosticate potential therapeutic drugs and scrutinize their associations with the identified Hub genes. Our findings unveil robust linkages between three pivotal Hub genes—namely, RNF13, VASP, and CD163—and specific immune cell types such as T cells and neutrophils. These Hub genes predominantly manifest in macrophages and microglial cells within the scRNA-seq immune cell population, exhibiting variances across different stages of cellular differentiation. In conclusion, this study unearths highly pertinent biomarkers for IS diagnosis and elucidates IS-induced immune infiltration characteristics, thus providing a firm foundation for a comprehensive exploration of potential immune mechanisms and the identification of novel therapeutic targets for IS.

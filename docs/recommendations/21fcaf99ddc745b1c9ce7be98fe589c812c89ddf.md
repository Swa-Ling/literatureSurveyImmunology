        <tr id="The rising global prevalence of neuroinflammatory diseases poses a formidable public health challenge. Central to these pathologies are microglia, the innate immune sentinels of the central nervous system, whose dysregulation contributes significantly to neurodegeneration. In 2025, the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and neurobiology is catalyzing a paradigm shift in the restoration of neural homeostasis. This paper presents a forward-looking synthesis of how AI-driven platforms are enabling high-throughput analysis of multi-omics data to identify actionable microglial targets such as TREM2 and CSF1R for therapeutic modulation. Coupled with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, AI orchestrates the reprogramming of microglia toward neuroprotective phenotypes, thereby mitigating neuroinflammation and facilitating cognitive recovery in preclinical models. While promising, challenges remain: addressing microglial heterogeneity, establishing reliable biomarkers, ensuring long-term safety, and overcoming ethical and regulatory barriers. This article advocates for multidisciplinary collaboration, infrastructure reform, and equitable policy frameworks to advance AI-orchestrated microglial therapies from research to clinical application, marking a transformative stride in precision neurology.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes play an important role in various processes in the brain, including pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have shown that the increase in saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid (PA) triggers pro-inflammatory pathways in the brain. The use of synthetic neurosteroids such as tibolone has demonstrated neuro-protective mechanisms. However, broad studies, with a systemic point of view on the neurodegenerative role of PA and the neuro-protective mechanisms of tibolone are lacking. In this study, we performed the integration of multi-omic data (transcriptome and proteome) into a human astrocyte genomic scale metabolic model to study the astrocytic response during palmitate treatment. We evaluated metabolic fluxes in three scenarios (healthy, induced inflammation by PA, and tibolone treatment under PA inflammation). We also applied a control theory approach to identify those reactions that exert more control in the astrocytic system. Our results suggest that PA generates a modulation of central and secondary metabolism, showing a switch in energy source use through inhibition of folate cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation and upregulation of ketone bodies formation. We found 25 metabolic switches under PA-mediated cellular regulation, 9 of which were critical only in the inflammatory scenario but not in the protective tibolone one. Within these reactions, inhibitory, total, and directional coupling profiles were key findings, playing a fundamental role in the (de)regulation in metabolic pathways that may increase neurotoxicity and represent potential treatment targets. Finally, the overall framework of our approach facilitates the understanding of complex metabolic regulation, and it can be used for in silico exploration of the mechanisms of astrocytic cell regulation, directing a more complex future experimental work in neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="The brain needs more energy than other organs in the body. Mitochondria are the generator of vital power in the living organism. Not only do mitochondria sense signals from the outside of a cell, but they also orchestrate the cascade of subcellular events by supplying adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the biochemical energy. It is known that impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress contribute or lead to neuronal damage and degeneration of the brain. This mini-review focuses on addressing how mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we discuss state-of-the-art computational models of mitochondrial functions in relation to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Together, a better understanding of brain disease-specific mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress can pave the way to developing antioxidant therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neuronal activity and prevent neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide, highlighting the complex relationship between the immune system and the central nervous system. Astrocytes are recognized as significant contributors to the disease's pathogenesis. In this work, a biophysically realistic astrocytic model was created to investigate astrocytes' role in MS development, focusing on their impact on axonal conduction and enhanced sodium channel facilitation in demyelinated axons. Through the advancement of comprehension about the involvement of astrocytes in the pathophysiology of MS, this study explores the processes underlying the disease. The study also examines the morphology of astrocytes and its influence on cellular activity, providing insights into cell instability drivers and the interaction between morphological changes and functional modifications. This approach aims to understand the complex connections between cellular characteristics and physiological attributes, enhancing our understanding of multiple sclerosis and potentially developing groundbreaking therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
A multitude of high-quality imaging modalities exist that provide structural data at unprecedented levels of detail. Tissue ultrastructure greatly influences the rate of transport of proteins and other molecules that contribute to neurodegeneration. However, our ability to model flow and diffusion processes in the brain lags behind the quality of the neuroimaging data. Here, a new framework will be presented for converting neuroimaging data into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in a scalable manner suitable for high performance computing. TEM data from the Allen Institute will illustrate its capabilities.


METHODS
Segmented TEM images were downloaded from the MicronsExplorer public storage cache. Segmented image stack volumes (4 × 4 × 4 µm) were converted into surface meshes using the Lewiner Marching Cubes algorithm. Convection and diffusion along the surface of individual cells was modeled. After each timestep mass was allowed to exchange between neighboring cells, implemented on a high performance computing cluster using the MPI protocol on 40 or more computing cores. Multiple volumes were analyzed simultaneously, with updates of the flux between cells in different volumes occurring at each time step. These steps were performed with new custom CFD code written in C and Julia.


RESULTS
Segmented z-stacks of TEM data from the MICrONS Explorer website were downloaded in 4 × 4 × 4 µm blocks, which typically contain ≈500 distinct cells (Fig. 1A&B). The meshing algorithm leads to perfect matching between adjacent cells (Fig. 1C). The convection-diffusion equations are solved, modeling flow/diffusion of solutes between cells (Fig. 1D&E). Equations are solved for all ≈500 distinct cells in parallel, with concentrations at matching faces re-balanced at each time step (Fig. 2A&B). A manager-worker MPI model allows for solution on an arbitrary number of cores (Fig. 2C). The interfaces between cell surfaces across volumes are also perfectly matched, allowing for adjustment of the flux of mass between volumes at each timestep (Fig. 2D).


CONCLUSIONS
A new modeling framework is described for solution of transport equations on high performance computing clusters for any imaging modality that produces segmented z-stacked images.">

        <tr id="Neuroimmune responses by astrocytes and microglia play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Reactive astrocytes have diverse responses to triggers and can release a wide variety of effector molecules in an insult‐specific manner. Identifying key mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis in large datasets is key to finding new therapeutic targets, but the interpretation of such datasets is challenging. Causal biological network (CBNs) models assemble available biological knowledge in a structured computable format that facilitates mechanistic interpretation of molecular data in a well‐defined biological context. Here, we present a CBN model of pan‐reactive astrogliosis genes as a new tool to explore and quantify the extent of reactive astrogliosis based on transcriptomic data and identify key molecular drivers of the phenotype.">

Manual assessment of such a broad literature base is daunting. We performed a comprehensive informatics-based systematic review or ‘field analysis’ to agnostically compute and map the current state of the field. Text mining of recaptured articles was used to quantify published data topic breadth and frequency. We constructed a nine-category pathophysiological function-based ontology to systematically organize and quantify the field's primary data. Results demonstrated that the distribution of primary research belonging to each category is: systemic measures an motor function, 59%; inflammation, 46%; cellular energetics, 37%; proteomics, 31%; neural excitability, 22%; apoptosis, 20%; oxidative stress, 18%; aberrant cellular chemistry, 14%; axonal transport, 10%. We constructed a SOD1-G93A field map that visually illustrates and categorizes the 85% most frequently assessed sub-topics. Finally, we present the literature-cited significance of frequently published terms and uncover thinly investigated areas. In conclusion, most articles individually examine at least two categories, which is indicative of the numerous underlying pathophysiological interrelationships. An essential future path is examination of cross-category pathophysiological interrelationships and their co-correspondence to homeostatic regulation and disease progression.">

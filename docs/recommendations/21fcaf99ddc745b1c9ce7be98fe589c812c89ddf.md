        <tr id="The rising global prevalence of neuroinflammatory diseases poses a formidable public health challenge. Central to these pathologies are microglia, the innate immune sentinels of the central nervous system, whose dysregulation contributes significantly to neurodegeneration. In 2025, the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and neurobiology is catalyzing a paradigm shift in the restoration of neural homeostasis. This paper presents a forward-looking synthesis of how AI-driven platforms are enabling high-throughput analysis of multi-omics data to identify actionable microglial targets such as TREM2 and CSF1R for therapeutic modulation. Coupled with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, AI orchestrates the reprogramming of microglia toward neuroprotective phenotypes, thereby mitigating neuroinflammation and facilitating cognitive recovery in preclinical models. While promising, challenges remain: addressing microglial heterogeneity, establishing reliable biomarkers, ensuring long-term safety, and overcoming ethical and regulatory barriers. This article advocates for multidisciplinary collaboration, infrastructure reform, and equitable policy frameworks to advance AI-orchestrated microglial therapies from research to clinical application, marking a transformative stride in precision neurology.">

        <tr id="The brain needs more energy than other organs in the body. Mitochondria are the generator of vital power in the living organism. Not only do mitochondria sense signals from the outside of a cell, but they also orchestrate the cascade of subcellular events by supplying adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), the biochemical energy. It is known that impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress contribute or lead to neuronal damage and degeneration of the brain. This mini-review focuses on addressing how mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we discuss state-of-the-art computational models of mitochondrial functions in relation to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Together, a better understanding of brain disease-specific mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress can pave the way to developing antioxidant therapeutic strategies to ameliorate neuronal activity and prevent neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes and microglia react to Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. Single-nuclei and single-cell RNA-seq have revealed multiple states or subpopulations of these glial cells but lack spatial information. We have developed a methodology of cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry on human postmortem brains and image analysis that enables a comprehensive morphological quantitative characterization of astrocytes and microglia in the context of their spatial relationships with plaques and tangles. Single FFPE sections from the temporal association cortex of control and AD subjects were subjected to 8 cycles of multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry, including 7 astroglial, 6 microglial, 1 neuronal, Aβ, and phospho-tau markers. Our analysis pipeline consisted of: (1) image alignment across cycles; (2) background subtraction; (3) manual annotation of 5172 ALDH1L1+ astrocytic and 6226 IBA1+ microglial profiles; (4) local thresholding and segmentation of profiles; (5) machine learning on marker intensity data; and (6) deep learning on image features. Spectral clustering identified three phenotypes of astrocytes and microglia, which we termed “homeostatic,” “intermediate,” and “reactive.” Reactive and, to a lesser extent, intermediate astrocytes and microglia were closely associated with AD pathology (≤ 50 µm). Compared to homeostatic, reactive astrocytes contained substantially higher GFAP and YKL-40, modestly elevated vimentin and TSPO as well as EAAT1, and reduced GS. Intermediate astrocytes had markedly increased EAAT2, moderately increased GS, and intermediate GFAP and YKL-40 levels. Relative to homeostatic, reactive microglia showed increased expression of all markers (CD68, ferritin, MHC2, TMEM119, TSPO), whereas intermediate microglia exhibited increased ferritin and TMEM119 as well as intermediate CD68 levels. Machine learning models applied on either high-plex signal intensity data (gradient boosting machines) or directly on image features (convolutional neural networks) accurately discriminated control vs. AD diagnoses at the single-cell level. Cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry combined with machine learning models holds promise to advance our understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of glial responses as well as inform transcriptomics studies. Three distinct phenotypes emerged with our combination of markers, thus expanding the classic binary “homeostatic vs. reactive” classification to a third state, which could represent “transitional” or “resilient” glia.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), specific brain regions become vulnerable to pathology while others remain resilient. New methods of imaging such as highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) provide an abundance of spatial information, while analytical techniques like machine learning (ML) can address questions of cellular contributors to this regional vulnerability.


METHOD
We performed MxIF staining for 26 markers and compared postmortem human samples from an AD-susceptible brain area, the prefrontal cortex (PFC, Brodmann's areas 9, 10 or 46) to an AD-resilient brain area, the primary visual cortex (V1, area 17). Subjects included AD (n = 3, clinical dementia rating CDR 3, Thal stages 3-4, Braak stages V-VI), mild cognitive impairment (n = 4, CDR 0.5, Thal stages 1-3, Braak stages I-V), and age-matched healthy controls (n = 5, CDR 0, Thal stages 0-1, Braak stages I-II), including both females and males. We first used a custom Fiji plugin that leverages iterative ML to segment the images via DAPI or HUD signals. For the DAPI segmentation, ML subsequently classifies the cell type based on relevant channels. The second method used QuPath to segment exclusively using DAPI signal followed by cell-type classifications. Segmentations and classifications in QuPath used static thresholds.


RESULT
Using Fiji for HUD segmentation and filtering by the presence of nuclei, we found a decrease specifically in layer 5 PFC neurons from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Surprisingly, this decrease did not hold in QuPath when segmenting first using DAPI. Both methods found an increase in GFAP-expressing astrocytes primarily in layer 1. However, the pan-astrocyte marker ALDH1L1 showed an inverse relationship, with higher density found in layers 2 through 6. Both findings held true regardless of brain region or CDR. Finally, in addition to the white matter, both methods found an increase in oligodendrocytes (MBP+, MBP+/HUD+) within layer 4 of V1 and driven by CDR 0.5.


CONCLUSION
Comparisons between the image analysis modalities demonstrate that the method by which cells are segmented and classified can impact the interpretation of MxIF data. Combining knowledge of disease biology with a deeper understanding of when and how to use these techniques will improve data precision.">

        <tr id="Microglia are the immune cell in the central nervous system (CNS) and exist in a surveillant state characterized by a ramified form in the healthy brain. In response to brain injury or disease including neurodegenerative diseases, they become activated and change their morphology. Due to known correlation between this activation and neuroinflammation, there is great interest in improved approaches for studying microglial activation in the context of CNS disease mechanisms. One classic approach has utilized Microglia's morphology as one of the key indicators of its activation and correlated with its functional state. More recently microglial activation has been shown to have intrinsic NADH metabolic signatures that are detectable via fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Despite the promise of morphology and metabolism as key fingerprints of microglial function, they has not been analyzed together due to lack of an appropriate computational framework. Here we present a deep neural network to study the effect of both morphology and FLIM metabolic signatures toward identifying its activation status. Our model is tested on 1, 000+ cells (ground truth generated using LPS treatment) and provides a state-of-the-art framework to identify microglial activation and its role in neurodegenerative diseases.">

Reactive astrocytes have diverse responses to triggers and can release a wide variety of effector molecules in an insult‐specific manner. Identifying key mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis in large datasets is key to finding new therapeutic targets, but the interpretation of such datasets is challenging. Causal biological network (CBNs) models assemble available biological knowledge in a structured computable format that facilitates mechanistic interpretation of molecular data in a well‐defined biological context. Here, we present a CBN model of pan‐reactive astrogliosis genes as a new tool to explore and quantify the extent of reactive astrogliosis based on transcriptomic data and identify key molecular drivers of the phenotype.">

Manual assessment of such a broad literature base is daunting. We performed a comprehensive informatics-based systematic review or ‘field analysis’ to agnostically compute and map the current state of the field. Text mining of recaptured articles was used to quantify published data topic breadth and frequency. We constructed a nine-category pathophysiological function-based ontology to systematically organize and quantify the field's primary data. Results demonstrated that the distribution of primary research belonging to each category is: systemic measures an motor function, 59%; inflammation, 46%; cellular energetics, 37%; proteomics, 31%; neural excitability, 22%; apoptosis, 20%; oxidative stress, 18%; aberrant cellular chemistry, 14%; axonal transport, 10%. We constructed a SOD1-G93A field map that visually illustrates and categorizes the 85% most frequently assessed sub-topics. Finally, we present the literature-cited significance of frequently published terms and uncover thinly investigated areas. In conclusion, most articles individually examine at least two categories, which is indicative of the numerous underlying pathophysiological interrelationships. An essential future path is examination of cross-category pathophysiological interrelationships and their co-correspondence to homeostatic regulation and disease progression.">

        <tr id="Predicting individual vaccine responses remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and variability of immune processes. To address this gap, we developed immunaut, an open-source, data-driven framework implemented as an R package specifically designed for all systems vaccinologists seeking to analyze and predict immunological outcomes across diverse vaccination settings. Leveraging one of the most comprehensive live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) datasets to date - 244 Gambian children enrolled in a phase 4 immunogenicity study - immunaut integrates humoral, mucosal, cellular, transcriptomic, and microbiological parameters collected before and after vaccination, providing an unprecedentedly holistic view of LAIV-induced immunity. Through advanced dimensionality reduction, clustering, and predictive modeling, immunaut identifies distinct immunophenotypic responder profiles and their underlying baseline determinants. In this study, immunaut delineated three immunophenotypes: (1) CD8 T-cell responders, marked by strong baseline mucosal immunity and extensive prior influenza virus exposure that boosts memory CD8 T-cell responses, without generating influenza virus-specific antibody responses; (2) Mucosal responders, characterized by pre-existing systemic influenza A virus immunity (specifically to H3N2) and stable epithelial integrity, leading to potent mucosal IgA expansions and subsequent seroconversion to influenza B virus; and (3) Systemic, broad influenza A virus responders, who start with relatively naive immunity and leverage greater initial viral replication to drive broad systemic antibody responses against multiple influenza A virus variants beyond those included in the LAIV vaccine. By integrating pathway-level analysis, model-derived contribution scores, and hierarchical decision rules, immunaut elucidates how distinct immunological landscapes shape each response trajectory and how key baseline features, including pre-existing immunity, mucosal preparedness, and cellular support, dictate vaccine outcomes. Collectively, these findings emphasize the power of integrative, predictive frameworks to advance precision vaccinology, and highlight immunaut as a versatile, community-available resource for optimizing immunization strategies across diverse populations and vaccine platforms. One-Sentence Summary Using one of the most comprehensive LAIV datasets compiled to date, immunaut, an integrative machine learning framework, identifies distinct immunophenotypic responder groups shaped by baseline immune landscapes, advancing precision vaccinology and guiding more effective, personalized immunization strategies. Graphical abstract Immunaut, an automated framework for mapping and predicting vaccine response immunotypes. Step 1 outlines the identification of vaccine response outcomes using pre- and post-vaccination data integration across immune features, including antibodies, flu-specific T-cells, and immunophenotyping at mucosal and systemic sites. Clustering methods define the vaccine response landscape, stability, and validation through t-SNE-based visualization. Step 2 leverages an automated machine learning modeling approach, to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of vaccine response predictions, enabling stratification and targeted intervention strategies for personalized vaccine immunogenicity.">

 To improve diagnoses and further our understanding of functional defects in subjects with primary immunodeficiency (PI) diseases, we developed a new screen to broadly study the signaling of defective human immune responses to infections. Using time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and phospho-specific antibodies, we simultaneously examined the major signaling pathways of all circulating innate and adaptive immune cell types in response to cytokines and TLR agonists to identify signaling responses. We studied healthy controls and developed software tools to generate a systematic map of signaling responses. CyTOF successfully recapitulated established signaling responses, and further, elucidated new pathways that would not have been appreciated with traditional studies. Signaling map of controls was compared to maps generated by analyzing PI subjects with gain-of-function STAT1 and autosomal dominant STAT3 deficiency diseases. CyTOF allowed us to perform unbiased studies to uncover many ex-vivo signaling defects simultaneously to better understand how known genetic etiologies manifest functionally, and exactly which cell subtypes are affected. We identified more glaring defective signaling responses in these subjects aside from the canonical defects, elucidating the true breadth of cell subtypes and pathways affected. Broad, unbiased, functional analysis can complement whole exome sequencing to facilitate identification of novel or rare immune diseases. Comprehensive view of signaling across all immune cell subsets facilitates learning more about abnormal signaling patterns that confer susceptibility to infection or autoimmunity, improving our understanding of immune responses and can lead to new therapies.">

        <tr id="Summary
In solid-organ transplant recipients, a delicate balance between immunosuppression and immunocompetence must be achieved, which can be difficult to monitor in real-time. Shotgun sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been recently proposed as a new way to indirectly assess immune function in transplant recipients through analysis of the status of the human virome. To facilitate exploration of the utility of the human virome as an indicator of immune status, and to enable rapid, straightforward analyses by clinicians, we developed a fully automated computational pipeline, EzMap, for performing metagenomic analysis of the human virome. EzMap combines a number of tools to clean, filter, and subtract WGS reads by mapping to a reference human assembly. The relative abundance of each virus present is estimated using a maximum likelihood approach that accounts for genome size, and results are presented with interactive visualizations and taxonomy-based summaries that enable rapid insights. The pipeline is automated to run on both workstations and computing clusters for all steps. EzMap automates an otherwise tedious and time-consuming protocol and aims to facilitate rapid and reproducible insights from cfDNA.

        <tr id="Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a group of unconventional T cells that mainly recognize bacterial vitamin B metabolites presented on MHC-related protein 1 (MR1). MAIT cells have been shown to play an important role in controlling bacterial infection and in responding to viral infections. Furthermore, MAIT cells have been implicated in different chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. Despite their involvement in different physiological and pathological processes, a deeper understanding of MAIT cells is still lacking. Arguably, this can be attributed to the difficulty of quantifying and measuring MAIT cells in different biological samples which is commonly done using flow cytometry-based methods and single-cell-based RNA sequencing techniques. These methods mostly require fresh samples which are difficult to obtain, especially from tissues, have low to medium throughput, and are costly and labor-intensive. To address these limitations, we developed sequence-to-MAIT (Seq2MAIT) which is a transformer-based deep neural network capable of identifying MAIT cells in bulk TCR-sequencing datasets, enabling the quantification of MAIT cells from any biological materials where human DNA is available. Benchmarking Seq2MAIT across different test datasets showed an average area-under-the-receiver-operator-curve (AU[ROC]) >0.80. In conclusion, Seq2MAIT is a novel, economical, and scalable method for identifying and quantifying MAIT cells in virtually any biological sample.">

        <tr id="Vaccines are among the most cost-effective public health interventions for preventing infection-induced morbidity and mortality, yet much remains to be learned regarding the mechanisms by which vaccines protect. Systems immunology combines traditional immunology with modern ‘omic profiling techniques and computational modeling to promote rapid and transformative advances in vaccinology and vaccine discovery. The NIH/NIAID Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) has leveraged systems immunology approaches to identify molecular signatures associated with the immunogenicity of many vaccines. However, comparative analyses have been limited by the distributed nature of some data, potential batch effects across studies, and the absence of multiple relevant studies from non-HIPC groups in ImmPort . To support comparative analyses across different vaccines, we have created the Immune Signatures Data Resource, a compendium of standardized systems vaccinology datasets. This data resource is available through ImmuneSpace , along with code to reproduce the processing and batch normalization starting from the underlying study data in ImmPort and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The current release comprises 1405 participants from 53 cohorts profiling the response to 24 different vaccines. This novel systems vaccinology data release represents a valuable resource for comparative and meta-analyses that will accelerate our understanding of mechanisms underlying vaccine responses.

        <tr id="Defining physiology and methods to measure biological mechanisms is essential. Extensive datasets such as RNA sequencing are used with little analysis of the knowledge gained from the various methodologies. Within this work, we have processed publicly available NCBI RNAseq datasets using a combination of bioinformatics tools for the largest physiological organ, the skin. In many datasets, we identify the quality of the sample, human transcript mapping, the sex of each sample, foreign RNA from bacteria/viruses/protists, and the presence of B/T-cell immune repertoire. Processing 8,274 samples from 132 different experiments for skin samples identifies common flora of skin with elevation of protists (such as Leishmania), bacteria (Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium acnes), and viruses (HSV, HPV) that may be involved in physiological differences. We observed samples with the Heilongjiang tick virus, Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type I, and Equine Infectious Anemia Virus that likely play pathological roles in physiology. Integrating the various biomarkers identified five ideal datasets for skin pathologies that elucidated a novel correlation between the normal skin flora bacterium Bacillus megaterium with MHC complex regulation and the immune repertoire clonal expansion, particularly in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. Finally, we show that in multiple independent experiments, biological sex is associated with multiple sex chromosome gene differences, highlighting the importance of future work in studying sex differences in skin. Data integrations and multidimensional data mapping are critical for physiological omics advancements, and this work highlights the exciting ability to apply these tools to skin physiology.">

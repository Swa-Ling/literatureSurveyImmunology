        <tr id="We and others have reported evidence of T cell exhaustion in children with perinatal HIV with increased expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1, CD160, and TIM-3, but there is limited data on the virologic functional consequences of this immune exhaustion. We address this by using an immune database from Kenyan children with perinatal HIV and unexposed controls. We computationally integrate T cell profiles of differentiation, activation and exhaustion in an agent-based model (ABM) to predict how T cell exhaustion impacts viral control following HIV exposure in vitro. Our ABM includes macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T cells, cytokines, and HIV. Model mechanisms include viral dynamics, macrophage activation, T cell activation and proliferation, cytotoxic T cell killing, and cytokine/HIV diffusion and degradation. Participants are grouped by HIV plasma viremia and by age, less than 5 years or 5-18 years. Our findings indicate that cells from virally active participants, who have the highest levels of exhaustion, have lower predicted viral concentrations and infected cells compared to other participant groups during new infection. However, this coincides with higher cell death, suggesting that short-term viral control is associated with excessive inflammation, which could be detrimental long-term. Cells from virally suppressed participants older than 5 years can maintain lower viral concentrations while limiting cell death, reflecting a more sustainable short-term immune response. In virally suppressed children younger than 5 years, immune response patterns strongly resemble the age-matched healthy control group, suggesting early viral suppression may preserve antiviral immune responses. Our model predicts unique patterns of cell death for each participant group, with CD8 T cell death being dominant in virally active groups and CD4 T cell and macrophage death being dominant in healthy and virally suppressed groups. Finally, exhausted CD8 T cells are predicted to contribute significantly to CD8 T cell killing, proliferation, and activation in the virally active group, indicating partially functional CD8 T cells can still contribute to short-term viral control. Our analysis functionally integrates participant-specific immunophenotypic data to allow quantification of the extent, mechanisms, and impact of immune dysfunction in perinatal HIV and could inform pediatric HIV remission and cure strategies. Author Summary Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are vital for our ability to kill infected cells. However, chronic stimulation of CD8+ T cells can result in T cell exhaustion, leading to cellular dysfunction and reduced ability to fight infections. Here we ask: What impact does CD8+ T cell exhaustion have on the ability to control HIV replication over the short term? We answer this using a computational model, anchored in experimental data from children with perinatal HIV. We use participant-specific data on dozens of immune markers that characterize the state of their immune system. We carefully map these markers to known immune cell functions and use our model to predict how immune cells with these participant-specific markers would respond to HIV infection. Our results suggest that earlier viral suppression can lead to better immune function in children with perinatal HIV. Our findings also suggest that exhausted CD8+ T cells could still contribute to fighting HIV infection, but only if there are enough of them to compensate for their reduced functionality. Our work uses computational models to put valuable participant-specific data into context, allowing us to predict short-term infection outcomes and better understand immune function in children with perinatal HIV.">

        <tr id="Viral infections impose a substantial threat to human health, characterized by a wide range of pathogens, clinical manifestations, and complex immune responses. Single-cell multi-omics technologies have revolutionized the study of antiviral immunity by resolving cellular heterogeneity, transcriptional reprogramming, and clonal dynamics. However, no resource has yet comprehensively integrated such datasets in the context of viral infections. Here, we present scMOVIR, a single-cell multi-omics database for human viral infections and immune responses. The database systematically integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and immune receptor repertoire profiles at single-cell resolution, compiling 8532 human samples across 114 viral species, subtypes, and strains. These datasets span 59 well-defined disease states, including acute and chronic infections, virus-associated malignancies, and immune-related disorders, and extend across >30 tissue types. In addition, these datasets incorporate vaccination cohorts, therapeutic interventions, and time-course models of infection. To ensure consistency and interoperability, all datasets undergo standardized preprocessing, including batch correction and unified cell-type annotation, with metadata harmonized using authoritative ontologies. scMOVIR provides user-friendly interfaces for dataset exploration and interactive visualization of cellular dynamics and molecular profiles, offering a high-resolution reference for investigating virus-host immune interactions and supporting antiviral research. The database is freely accessible at https://pgx.zju.edu.cn/scmovir.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The human gut virome is predominantly made up of bacteriophages (phages), viruses that infect bacteria. Metagenomic studies have revealed that phages in the gut are highly individual specific and dynamic. These features make it challenging to perform meaningful cross-study comparisons. While several taxonomy frameworks exist to group phages and improve these comparisons, these strategies provide little insight into the potential effects phages have on their bacterial hosts. Here, we propose the use of predicted phage host families (PHFs) as a functionally relevant, qualitative unit of phage classification to improve these cross-study analyses. We first show that bioinformatic predictions of phage hosts are accurate at the host family level by measuring their concordance to Hi-C sequencing-based predictions in human and mouse fecal samples. Next, using phage host family predictions, we determined that PHFs reduce intra- and interindividual ecological distances compared to viral contigs in a previously published cohort of 10 healthy individuals, while simultaneously improving longitudinal virome stability. Lastly, by reanalyzing a previously published metagenomics data set with >1,000 samples, we determined that PHFs are prevalent across individuals and can aid in the detection of inflammatory bowel disease-specific virome signatures. Overall, our analyses support the use of predicted phage hosts in reducing between-sample distances and providing a biologically relevant framework for making between-sample virome comparisons. IMPORTANCE The human gut virome consists mainly of bacteriophages (phages), which infect bacteria and show high individual specificity and variability, complicating cross-study comparisons. Furthermore, existing taxonomic frameworks offer limited insight into their interactions with bacterial hosts. In this study, we propose using predicted phage host families (PHFs) as a higher-level classification unit to enhance functional cross-study comparisons. We demonstrate that bioinformatic predictions of phage hosts align with Hi-C sequencing results at the host family level in human and mouse fecal samples. We further show that PHFs reduce ecological distances and improve virome stability over time. Additionally, reanalysis of a large metagenomics data set revealed that PHFs are widespread and can help identify disease-specific virome patterns, such as those linked to inflammatory bowel disease.

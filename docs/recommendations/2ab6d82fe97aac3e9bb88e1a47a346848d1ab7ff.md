        <tr id="An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the exacerbation of disease progression of both COVID-19 and HIV when coexisting. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between these two viruses are still poorly understood. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive analysis of single-cell transcriptomics to identify and characterize peripheral blood cell subsets in COVID-19 and HIV-infected patients. Our findings revealed that COVID-19 and HIV exhibit a partially similar cellular composition and cell cycle distribution. Additionally, we identified a common pathogenesis in B-cell subsets of COVID-19 and HIV patients, which showed abnormal activation states of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Based on B-cell signature genes and UPR-related genes, we developed a machine learning diagnostic model that can accurately diagnose both COVID-19 and HIV infections. Our model was validated using a large number of bulk transcriptome data sets and showed good clinical efficacy. Our study provides molecular insights into the single-cell level interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infections, suggesting a possible common disease mechanism that warrants further investigation.">

        <tr id="Human immunity relies on the coordinated responses of many cellular subsets and functional states. Inter-individual variations in cellular composition and communication could thus potentially alter host protection. Here, we explore this hypothesis by applying single-cell RNA-sequencing to examine viral responses among the dendritic cells (DCs) of three elite controllers (ECs) of HIV-1 infection. To overcome the potentially confounding effects of donor-to-donor variability, we present a generally applicable computational framework for identifying reproducible patterns in gene expression across donors who share a unifying classification. Applying it, we discover a highly functional antiviral DC state in ECs whose fractional abundance after in vitro exposure to HIV-1 correlates with higher CD4+ T cell counts and lower HIV-1 viral loads, and that effectively primes polyfunctional T cell responses in vitro. By integrating information from existing genomic databases into our reproducibility-based analysis, we identify and validate select immunomodulators that increase the fractional abundance of this state in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals in vitro. Overall, our results demonstrate how single-cell approaches can reveal previously unappreciated, yet important, immune behaviors and empower rational frameworks for modulating systems-level immune responses that may prove therapeutically and prophylactically useful.">

        <tr id="We and others have reported evidence of T cell exhaustion in children with perinatal HIV with increased expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1, CD160, and TIM-3, but there is limited data on the virologic functional consequences of this immune exhaustion. We address this by using an immune database from Kenyan children with perinatal HIV and unexposed controls. We computationally integrate T cell profiles of differentiation, activation and exhaustion in an agent-based model (ABM) to predict how T cell exhaustion impacts viral control following HIV exposure in vitro. Our ABM includes macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T cells, cytokines, and HIV. Model mechanisms include viral dynamics, macrophage activation, T cell activation and proliferation, cytotoxic T cell killing, and cytokine/HIV diffusion and degradation. Participants are grouped by HIV plasma viremia and by age, less than 5 years or 5-18 years. Our findings indicate that cells from virally active participants, who have the highest levels of exhaustion, have lower predicted viral concentrations and infected cells compared to other participant groups during new infection. However, this coincides with higher cell death, suggesting that short-term viral control is associated with excessive inflammation, which could be detrimental long-term. Cells from virally suppressed participants older than 5 years can maintain lower viral concentrations while limiting cell death, reflecting a more sustainable short-term immune response. In virally suppressed children younger than 5 years, immune response patterns strongly resemble the age-matched healthy control group, suggesting early viral suppression may preserve antiviral immune responses. Our model predicts unique patterns of cell death for each participant group, with CD8 T cell death being dominant in virally active groups and CD4 T cell and macrophage death being dominant in healthy and virally suppressed groups. Finally, exhausted CD8 T cells are predicted to contribute significantly to CD8 T cell killing, proliferation, and activation in the virally active group, indicating partially functional CD8 T cells can still contribute to short-term viral control. Our analysis functionally integrates participant-specific immunophenotypic data to allow quantification of the extent, mechanisms, and impact of immune dysfunction in perinatal HIV and could inform pediatric HIV remission and cure strategies.">

 To improve diagnoses and further our understanding of functional defects in subjects with primary immunodeficiency (PI) diseases, we developed a new screen to broadly study the signaling of defective human immune responses to infections. Using time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and phospho-specific antibodies, we simultaneously examined the major signaling pathways of all circulating innate and adaptive immune cell types in response to cytokines and TLR agonists to identify signaling responses. We studied healthy controls and developed software tools to generate a systematic map of signaling responses. CyTOF successfully recapitulated established signaling responses, and further, elucidated new pathways that would not have been appreciated with traditional studies. Signaling map of controls was compared to maps generated by analyzing PI subjects with gain-of-function STAT1 and autosomal dominant STAT3 deficiency diseases. CyTOF allowed us to perform unbiased studies to uncover many ex-vivo signaling defects simultaneously to better understand how known genetic etiologies manifest functionally, and exactly which cell subtypes are affected. We identified more glaring defective signaling responses in these subjects aside from the canonical defects, elucidating the true breadth of cell subtypes and pathways affected. Broad, unbiased, functional analysis can complement whole exome sequencing to facilitate identification of novel or rare immune diseases. Comprehensive view of signaling across all immune cell subsets facilitates learning more about abnormal signaling patterns that confer susceptibility to infection or autoimmunity, improving our understanding of immune responses and can lead to new therapies.">

        <tr id="Numerous HIV related outcomes can be determined on the viral genome, for example, resistance associated mutations, population transmission dynamics, viral heritability traits, or time since infection. Viral sequences of people with HIV (PWH) are therefore essential for therapeutic and research purposes. While in the first three decades of the HIV pandemic viral genomes were mainly sequenced using Sanger sequencing, the last decade has seen a shift towards next-generation sequencing (NGS) as the preferred method. NGS can achieve near full length genome sequence coverage and simultaneously, it accurately encapsulates the within-host diversity by characterizing HIV subpopulations. NGS opens new avenues for HIV research, but it also presents challenges concerning data management and analysis. We therefore set up the Swiss HIV Cohort Study Viral NGS Database (SHCND) to address key issues in the handling of NGS data including high loads of raw- and processed NGS data, data storage solutions, downstream application of sophisticated bioinformatic tools, high-performance computing resources, and reproducibility. The database is nested within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the Zurich Primary HIV Infection Cohort Study (ZPHI), which together enrolled 21,876 PWH since 1988 and include a biobank dating back to the early nineties. Since its initiation in 2018, the SHCND accumulated NGS sequences (plasma and proviral origin) of 5,178 unique PWH. We here describe the design, set-up, and use of this NGS database. Overall, the SHCND has contributed to several research projects on HIV pathogenesis, treatment, drug resistance, and molecular epidemiology, and has thereby become a central part of HIV-genomics research in Switzerland.">

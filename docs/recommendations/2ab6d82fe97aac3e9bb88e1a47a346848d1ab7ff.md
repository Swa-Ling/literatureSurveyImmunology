        <tr id="Predicting individual vaccine responses remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and variability of immune processes. To address this gap, we developed immunaut, an open-source, data-driven framework implemented as an R package specifically designed for all systems vaccinologists seeking to analyze and predict immunological outcomes across diverse vaccination settings. Leveraging one of the most comprehensive live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) datasets to date - 244 Gambian children enrolled in a phase 4 immunogenicity study - immunaut integrates humoral, mucosal, cellular, transcriptomic, and microbiological parameters collected before and after vaccination, providing an unprecedentedly holistic view of LAIV-induced immunity. Through advanced dimensionality reduction, clustering, and predictive modeling, immunaut identifies distinct immunophenotypic responder profiles and their underlying baseline determinants. In this study, immunaut delineated three immunophenotypes: (1) CD8 T-cell responders, marked by strong baseline mucosal immunity and extensive prior influenza virus exposure that boosts memory CD8 T-cell responses, without generating influenza virus-specific antibody responses; (2) Mucosal responders, characterized by pre-existing systemic influenza A virus immunity (specifically to H3N2) and stable epithelial integrity, leading to potent mucosal IgA expansions and subsequent seroconversion to influenza B virus; and (3) Systemic, broad influenza A virus responders, who start with relatively naive immunity and leverage greater initial viral replication to drive broad systemic antibody responses against multiple influenza A virus variants beyond those included in the LAIV vaccine. By integrating pathway-level analysis, model-derived contribution scores, and hierarchical decision rules, immunaut elucidates how distinct immunological landscapes shape each response trajectory and how key baseline features, including pre-existing immunity, mucosal preparedness, and cellular support, dictate vaccine outcomes. Collectively, these findings emphasize the power of integrative, predictive frameworks to advance precision vaccinology, and highlight immunaut as a versatile, community-available resource for optimizing immunization strategies across diverse populations and vaccine platforms. One-Sentence Summary Using one of the most comprehensive LAIV datasets compiled to date, immunaut, an integrative machine learning framework, identifies distinct immunophenotypic responder groups shaped by baseline immune landscapes, advancing precision vaccinology and guiding more effective, personalized immunization strategies. Graphical abstract Immunaut, an automated framework for mapping and predicting vaccine response immunotypes. Step 1 outlines the identification of vaccine response outcomes using pre- and post-vaccination data integration across immune features, including antibodies, flu-specific T-cells, and immunophenotyping at mucosal and systemic sites. Clustering methods define the vaccine response landscape, stability, and validation through t-SNE-based visualization. Step 2 leverages an automated machine learning modeling approach, to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of vaccine response predictions, enabling stratification and targeted intervention strategies for personalized vaccine immunogenicity.">

        <tr id="Vaccines are among the most cost-effective public health interventions for preventing infection-induced morbidity and mortality, yet much remains to be learned regarding the mechanisms by which vaccines protect. Systems immunology combines traditional immunology with modern ‘omic profiling techniques and computational modeling to promote rapid and transformative advances in vaccinology and vaccine discovery. The NIH/NIAID Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) has leveraged systems immunology approaches to identify molecular signatures associated with the immunogenicity of many vaccines. However, comparative analyses have been limited by the distributed nature of some data, potential batch effects across studies, and the absence of multiple relevant studies from non-HIPC groups in ImmPort . To support comparative analyses across different vaccines, we have created the Immune Signatures Data Resource, a compendium of standardized systems vaccinology datasets. This data resource is available through ImmuneSpace , along with code to reproduce the processing and batch normalization starting from the underlying study data in ImmPort and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The current release comprises 1405 participants from 53 cohorts profiling the response to 24 different vaccines. This novel systems vaccinology data release represents a valuable resource for comparative and meta-analyses that will accelerate our understanding of mechanisms underlying vaccine responses.

        <tr id="Individuals with systemic symptoms long after COVID-19 has cleared represent approximately ~10% of all COVID-19 infected individuals. Here we present a bioinformatics approach to predict and model the phases of COVID so that effective treatment strategies can be devised and monitored. We investigated 144 individuals including normal individuals and patients spanning the COVID-19 disease continuum. We collected plasma and isolated PBMCs from 29 normal individuals, 26 individuals with mild-moderate COVID-19, 25 individuals with severe COVID-19, and 64 individuals with Chronic COVID-19 symptoms. Immune subset profiling and a 14-plex cytokine panel were run on all patients. Data was analyzed using machine learning methods to predict and distinguish the groups from each other.Using a multi-class deep neural network classifier to better fit our prediction model, we recapitulated a 100% precision, 100% recall and F1 score of 1 on the test set. Moreover, a first score specific for the chronic COVID-19 patients was defined as S1 = (IFN-γ + IL-2)/ CCL4-MIP-1β. Second, a score specific for the severe COVID-19 patients was defined as S2 = (10*IL-10 + IL-6) - (IL-2 + IL-8). Severe cases are characterized by excessive inflammation and dysregulated T cell activation, recruitment, and counteracting activities. While chronic patients are characterized by a profile able to induce the activation of effector T cells with pro-inflammatory properties and the capacity of generating an effective immune response to eliminate the virus but without the proper recruitment signals to attract activated T cells.

        <tr id="Simple Summary It is known that COVID-19 causes dynamic changes in the immune system. At different stages of the course of COVID-19, the immune cells may exhibit different patterns, which have not been fully uncovered. In this study, a machine-learning-based method was designed to deeply analyze the scRNA-seq data of three types of immune cells from patients with COVID-19, including B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. Four levels of COVID-19 severity/outcome were involved for each cell type. As a result, several essential genes were obtained, and some of them could be confirmed to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Abstract As COVID-19 develops, dynamic changes occur in the patient’s immune system. Changes in molecular levels in different immune cells can reflect the course of COVID-19. This study aims to uncover the molecular characteristics of different immune cell subpopulations at different stages of COVID-19. We designed a machine learning workflow to analyze scRNA-seq data of three immune cell types (B, T, and myeloid cells) in four levels of COVID-19 severity/outcome. The datasets for three cell types included 403,700 B-cell, 634,595 T-cell, and 346,547 myeloid cell samples. Each cell subtype was divided into four groups, control, convalescence, progression mild/moderate, and progression severe/critical, and each immune cell contained 27,943 gene features. A feature analysis procedure was applied to the data of each cell type. Irrelevant features were first excluded according to their relevance to the target variable measured by mutual information. Then, four ranking algorithms (last absolute shrinkage and selection operator, light gradient boosting machine, Monte Carlo feature selection, and max-relevance and min-redundancy) were adopted to analyze the remaining features, resulting in four feature lists. These lists were fed into the incremental feature selection, incorporating three classification algorithms (decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest) to extract key gene features and construct classifiers with superior performance. The results confirmed that genes such as PFN1, RPS26, and FTH1 played important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings provide a useful reference for the understanding of the ongoing effect of COVID-19 development on the immune system.">

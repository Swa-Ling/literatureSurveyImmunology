        <tr id="Human immunity relies on the coordinated responses of many cellular subsets and functional states. Inter-individual variations in cellular composition and communication could thus potentially alter host protection. Here, we explore this hypothesis by applying single-cell RNA-sequencing to examine viral responses among the dendritic cells (DCs) of three elite controllers (ECs) of HIV-1 infection. To overcome the potentially confounding effects of donor-to-donor variability, we present a generally applicable computational framework for identifying reproducible patterns in gene expression across donors who share a unifying classification. Applying it, we discover a highly functional antiviral DC state in ECs whose fractional abundance after in vitro exposure to HIV-1 correlates with higher CD4+ T cell counts and lower HIV-1 viral loads, and that effectively primes polyfunctional T cell responses in vitro. By integrating information from existing genomic databases into our reproducibility-based analysis, we identify and validate select immunomodulators that increase the fractional abundance of this state in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals in vitro. Overall, our results demonstrate how single-cell approaches can reveal previously unappreciated, yet important, immune behaviors and empower rational frameworks for modulating systems-level immune responses that may prove therapeutically and prophylactically useful.">

        <tr id="We and others have reported evidence of T cell exhaustion in children with perinatal HIV with increased expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1, CD160, and TIM-3, but there is limited data on the virologic functional consequences of this immune exhaustion. We address this by using an immune database from Kenyan children with perinatal HIV and unexposed controls. We computationally integrate T cell profiles of differentiation, activation and exhaustion in an agent-based model (ABM) to predict how T cell exhaustion impacts viral control following HIV exposure in vitro. Our ABM includes macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T cells, cytokines, and HIV. Model mechanisms include viral dynamics, macrophage activation, T cell activation and proliferation, cytotoxic T cell killing, and cytokine/HIV diffusion and degradation. Participants are grouped by HIV plasma viremia and by age, less than 5 years or 5-18 years. Our findings indicate that cells from virally active participants, who have the highest levels of exhaustion, have lower predicted viral concentrations and infected cells compared to other participant groups during new infection. However, this coincides with higher cell death, suggesting that short-term viral control is associated with excessive inflammation, which could be detrimental long-term. Cells from virally suppressed participants older than 5 years can maintain lower viral concentrations while limiting cell death, reflecting a more sustainable short-term immune response. In virally suppressed children younger than 5 years, immune response patterns strongly resemble the age-matched healthy control group, suggesting early viral suppression may preserve antiviral immune responses. Our model predicts unique patterns of cell death for each participant group, with CD8 T cell death being dominant in virally active groups and CD4 T cell and macrophage death being dominant in healthy and virally suppressed groups. Finally, exhausted CD8 T cells are predicted to contribute significantly to CD8 T cell killing, proliferation, and activation in the virally active group, indicating partially functional CD8 T cells can still contribute to short-term viral control. Our analysis functionally integrates participant-specific immunophenotypic data to allow quantification of the extent, mechanisms, and impact of immune dysfunction in perinatal HIV and could inform pediatric HIV remission and cure strategies. Author Summary Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are vital for our ability to kill infected cells. However, chronic stimulation of CD8+ T cells can result in T cell exhaustion, leading to cellular dysfunction and reduced ability to fight infections. Here we ask: What impact does CD8+ T cell exhaustion have on the ability to control HIV replication over the short term? We answer this using a computational model, anchored in experimental data from children with perinatal HIV. We use participant-specific data on dozens of immune markers that characterize the state of their immune system. We carefully map these markers to known immune cell functions and use our model to predict how immune cells with these participant-specific markers would respond to HIV infection. Our results suggest that earlier viral suppression can lead to better immune function in children with perinatal HIV. Our findings also suggest that exhausted CD8+ T cells could still contribute to fighting HIV infection, but only if there are enough of them to compensate for their reduced functionality. Our work uses computational models to put valuable participant-specific data into context, allowing us to predict short-term infection outcomes and better understand immune function in children with perinatal HIV.">

        <tr id="Viral infections impose a substantial threat to human health, characterized by a wide range of pathogens, clinical manifestations, and complex immune responses. Single-cell multi-omics technologies have revolutionized the study of antiviral immunity by resolving cellular heterogeneity, transcriptional reprogramming, and clonal dynamics. However, no resource has yet comprehensively integrated such datasets in the context of viral infections. Here, we present scMOVIR, a single-cell multi-omics database for human viral infections and immune responses. The database systematically integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and immune receptor repertoire profiles at single-cell resolution, compiling 8532 human samples across 114 viral species, subtypes, and strains. These datasets span 59 well-defined disease states, including acute and chronic infections, virus-associated malignancies, and immune-related disorders, and extend across >30 tissue types. In addition, these datasets incorporate vaccination cohorts, therapeutic interventions, and time-course models of infection. To ensure consistency and interoperability, all datasets undergo standardized preprocessing, including batch correction and unified cell-type annotation, with metadata harmonized using authoritative ontologies. scMOVIR provides user-friendly interfaces for dataset exploration and interactive visualization of cellular dynamics and molecular profiles, offering a high-resolution reference for investigating virus-host immune interactions and supporting antiviral research. The database is freely accessible at https://pgx.zju.edu.cn/scmovir.">

        <tr id="Predicting individual vaccine responses remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and variability of immune processes. To address this gap, we developed immunaut, an open-source, data-driven framework implemented as an R package specifically designed for all systems vaccinologists seeking to analyze and predict immunological outcomes across diverse vaccination settings. Leveraging one of the most comprehensive live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) datasets to date - 244 Gambian children enrolled in a phase 4 immunogenicity study - immunaut integrates humoral, mucosal, cellular, transcriptomic, and microbiological parameters collected before and after vaccination, providing an unprecedentedly holistic view of LAIV-induced immunity. Through advanced dimensionality reduction, clustering, and predictive modeling, immunaut identifies distinct immunophenotypic responder profiles and their underlying baseline determinants. In this study, immunaut delineated three immunophenotypes: (1) CD8 T-cell responders, marked by strong baseline mucosal immunity and extensive prior influenza virus exposure that boosts memory CD8 T-cell responses, without generating influenza virus-specific antibody responses; (2) Mucosal responders, characterized by pre-existing systemic influenza A virus immunity (specifically to H3N2) and stable epithelial integrity, leading to potent mucosal IgA expansions and subsequent seroconversion to influenza B virus; and (3) Systemic, broad influenza A virus responders, who start with relatively naive immunity and leverage greater initial viral replication to drive broad systemic antibody responses against multiple influenza A virus variants beyond those included in the LAIV vaccine. By integrating pathway-level analysis, model-derived contribution scores, and hierarchical decision rules, immunaut elucidates how distinct immunological landscapes shape each response trajectory and how key baseline features, including pre-existing immunity, mucosal preparedness, and cellular support, dictate vaccine outcomes. Collectively, these findings emphasize the power of integrative, predictive frameworks to advance precision vaccinology, and highlight immunaut as a versatile, community-available resource for optimizing immunization strategies across diverse populations and vaccine platforms. One-Sentence Summary Using one of the most comprehensive LAIV datasets compiled to date, immunaut, an integrative machine learning framework, identifies distinct immunophenotypic responder groups shaped by baseline immune landscapes, advancing precision vaccinology and guiding more effective, personalized immunization strategies. Graphical abstract Immunaut, an automated framework for mapping and predicting vaccine response immunotypes. Step 1 outlines the identification of vaccine response outcomes using pre- and post-vaccination data integration across immune features, including antibodies, flu-specific T-cells, and immunophenotyping at mucosal and systemic sites. Clustering methods define the vaccine response landscape, stability, and validation through t-SNE-based visualization. Step 2 leverages an automated machine learning modeling approach, to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of vaccine response predictions, enabling stratification and targeted intervention strategies for personalized vaccine immunogenicity.">

        <tr id="Bispecific T-cell engaging therapies harness the immune system to elicit an effective anticancer response. Modulating the immune activation avoiding potential adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a critical aspect to realizing the full potential of this therapy. The use of suitable exogenous intervention strategies to mitigate the CRS risk without compromising the antitumoral capability of bispecific antibody treatment is crucial. To this end, computational approaches can be instrumental to systematically exploring the effects of combining bispecific antibodies with CRS intervention strategies. Here, we employ a logical model to describe the action of bispecific antibodies and the complex interplay of various immune system components and use it to perform simulation experiments to improve the understanding of the factors affecting CRS. We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the comedications that could ameliorate CRS without impairing tumor clearance. Our results agree with publicly available experimental data suggesting anti-TNF and anti-IL6 as possible co-treatments. Furthermore, we suggest anti-IFNγ as a suitable candidate for clinical studies.">

        <tr id="With the advent of effective immunotherapies to battle cancers and diseases, an obstacle in recovery has become the potential side effects, specifically cytokine release syndrome (CRS). As there is little quantitative understanding of risks for developing CRS and the degree of its severity, this work explored a model-based approach to produce a library of in silico patients through sensitivity analysis of cytokine interaction parameters and a Monte Carlo sampling. The objective of producing the in silico patients was to correlate a known grading system of cytokine release syndrome severity and thus design a new formula for grading CRS. Using our CRS grading system as the foundation, this work produced not only a formula which related the in silico patient data to the different grades, but we effectively demonstrated a selective approach to reduce the grade of CRS with sequential cytokine inhibition targets. We achieved the reduction of grades by applying the insight from the sensitivity analysis, beginning with the most sensitive targets. Cytokines IL-1, IL-8, TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-6, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 were in turn the best targets for inhibition to alleviate CRS. Using this approach, patient cytokine time profiles in real-time can be related to the CRS grading system and if the grade is severe enough, action can be taken earlier during the treatment to prevent potentially life-threatening symptoms. What’s more, the identified inhibition sequence of the 9 cytokines provides guidance for clinical intervention of CRS.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction The complex pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) is being progressively deciphered, providing evidence for a multiplicity of pro-inflammatory pathways underlying heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and disease evolution. Areas covered Treatment strategies involving drug combinations are emerging as a preferred option to achieve remission in a vast majority of patients affected by systemic AIDs. The design of appropriate drug combinations can benefit from AID modeling following a comprehensive multi-omics molecular profiling of patients combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered computational analyses. Such disease models support patient stratification in homogeneous subgroups, shed light on dysregulated pro-inflammatory pathways and yield hypotheses regarding potential therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers to stratify and monitor patients during treatment. AID models inform the rational design of combination therapies interfering with independent pro-inflammatory pathways related to either one of five prominent immune compartments contributing to the pathophysiology of AIDs, i.e. pro-inflammatory signals originating from tissues, innate immune mechanisms, T lymphocyte activation, autoantibodies and B cell activation, as well as soluble mediators involved in immune cross-talk. Expert opinion The optimal management of AIDs in the future will rely upon rationally designed combination therapies, as a modality of a model-based Computational Precision Medicine taking into account the patients’ biological and clinical specificities.">

        <tr id="Because of their diverse clinical manifestations and intricate pathophysiology, autoimmune diseases which are defined by the immune system wrongly attacking healthy tissues present serious difficulties. Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown revolutionary promise in this field, especially in improving diagnostic precision, facilitating tailored treatment plans, and offering real-time illness tracking. This paper highlights AI's role in assessing various datasets pertaining to immune function and pathology while critically examining the present applications of AI in the therapy of autoimmune diseases. In order to find new biomarkers and enable early and accurate detection of various disorders, advanced AI approaches such as machine learning and deep learning have proven essential. AI-powered predictive models have demonstrated promise in predicting periods of remission and disease flares, allowing for prompt and focused treatment modifications. Furthermore, by accelerating the identification of promising therapeutic candidates and lowering related costs, AI is transforming drug discovery and repurposing. However, issues including data heterogeneity, algorithmic transparency, and patient confidence in AI-driven suggestions limit AI's full potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This paper highlights the need for ethical frameworks and interdisciplinary collaboration by examining these limits and suggesting solutions. This paper shows AI's potential to transform the diagnosis, treatment, and management of autoimmune disorders by combining recent developments and future applications. This will pave the way for a future where healthcare solutions are proactive, accurate, and individualized.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects 23 million people worldwide. It is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by the attack of inflammatory chemicals on the synovial tissue that lines joints. It is advantageous to develop effective, targeted treatments and identify specific diagnostic biomarkers for RA before extensive joint degradation, bone erosion, and cartilage destruction. Current modes of RA treatments have alleviated and notably halted the progression of RA. Despite this, not many patients reach low disease activity status after treatment, and a significant number of patients fail to respond to medication due to drug non-specificity. While the reasons for these rates remain unknown, the cellular and molecular signatures present in the synovial tissue for RA patients likely play a role in the varied treatment response. Thus, a drug that particularly targets specific genes and networks may have a significant effect in halting the progression of RA. This study evaluates and proposes potential drug targets through in silico mathematical modeling of various pathways of interest in RA. To understand how drugs interact with genes, we built a mathematical model with 30 two-gene and three-gene network interactions and analyzed the effect of 92 different perturbations to rate constants. We determined that inhibition of the LCK-CD4, VAV1-CD4, and MLT-ROR pathways could potentially serve as drug targets. We also found that increased activity of the DEC2-IL1β and the NF-kB-interleukin pathway and the decreased activity of the TNF-α-REV-ERB pathway could serve as diagnostic biomarkers.">

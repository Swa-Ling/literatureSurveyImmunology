        <tr id="Bispecific T-cell engaging therapies harness the immune system to elicit an effective anticancer response. Modulating the immune activation avoiding potential adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a critical aspect to realizing the full potential of this therapy. The use of suitable exogenous intervention strategies to mitigate the CRS risk without compromising the antitumoral capability of bispecific antibody treatment is crucial. To this end, computational approaches can be instrumental to systematically exploring the effects of combining bispecific antibodies with CRS intervention strategies. Here, we employ a logical model to describe the action of bispecific antibodies and the complex interplay of various immune system components and use it to perform simulation experiments to improve the understanding of the factors affecting CRS. We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the comedications that could ameliorate CRS without impairing tumor clearance. Our results agree with publicly available experimental data suggesting anti-TNF and anti-IL6 as possible co-treatments. Furthermore, we suggest anti-IFNγ as a suitable candidate for clinical studies.">

        <tr id="Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a lethal adverse event in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy, hindering this promising therapy for cancers, such as B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B‐ALL). Clinical management of CRS requires a better understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, a computational model of CRS during CAR T‐cell therapy is built to depict how the cellular interactions among CAR T‐cells, B‐ALL cells, and bystander monocytes, as well as the accompanying molecular interactions among various inflammatory cytokines, influence the severity of CRS. The model successfully defines the factors related to severe CRS and studies the effects of immunomodulatory therapy on CRS. The use of the model is also demonstrated as a precision medicine tool to optimize the treatment scheme, including personalized choice of CAR T‐cell products and control of switchable CAR T‐cell activity, for a more efficient and safer immunotherapy. This new computational oncology model can serve as a precision medicine tool to guide the clinical management of CRS during CAR T cell therapy.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is complicated by immune dysfunction. The impact of immune-based therapy in COVID-19 patients has been well documented, with some notable studies on the use of anti-cytokine medicines. However, the complexity of disease phenotypes, patient heterogeneity and the varying quality of evidence from immunotherapy studies provide problems in clinical decision-making. This review seeks to aid therapeutic decision-making by giving an overview of the immunological responses against COVID-19 disease that may contribute to the severity of the disease. We have extensively discussed theranostic methods for COVID-19 detection. With advancements in technology, bioinformatics has taken studies to a higher level. The paper also discusses the application of bioinformatics and machine learning tools for the diagnosis, vaccine design and drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="With the advent of effective immunotherapies to battle cancers and diseases, an obstacle in recovery has become the potential side effects, specifically cytokine release syndrome (CRS). As there is little quantitative understanding of risks for developing CRS and the degree of its severity, this work explored a model-based approach to produce a library of in silico patients through sensitivity analysis of cytokine interaction parameters and a Monte Carlo sampling. The objective of producing the in silico patients was to correlate a known grading system of cytokine release syndrome severity and thus design a new formula for grading CRS. Using our CRS grading system as the foundation, this work produced not only a formula which related the in silico patient data to the different grades, but we effectively demonstrated a selective approach to reduce the grade of CRS with sequential cytokine inhibition targets. We achieved the reduction of grades by applying the insight from the sensitivity analysis, beginning with the most sensitive targets. Cytokines IL-1, IL-8, TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-6, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 were in turn the best targets for inhibition to alleviate CRS. Using this approach, patient cytokine time profiles in real-time can be related to the CRS grading system and if the grade is severe enough, action can be taken earlier during the treatment to prevent potentially life-threatening symptoms. What’s more, the identified inhibition sequence of the 9 cytokines provides guidance for clinical intervention of CRS.">

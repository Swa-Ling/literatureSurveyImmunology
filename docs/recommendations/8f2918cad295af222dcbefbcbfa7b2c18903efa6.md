 Bispecific T cell engaging antibodies (TEAs) with one arm targeting a cancer antigen and another arm binding to CD3 have demonstrated impressive efficacy in multiple clinical studies. However, establishing a safety/efficacy balance remains challenging. For instance, some TEAs have severe safety issues. Additionally, not all patients or all cancer cells of one patient respond equally to TEAs. Here, we developed a next-generation bispecific TEA with better safety/efficacy balance and expanded mechanisms of action. Using the computer aided antibody design strategy, we replaced heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (HCDRs) in one Rituximab arm with HCDRs from a CD3 antibody and generated a novel CD20/CD3 bispecific antibody. After series of computer aided sequence optimization, the lead molecule, GB261, showed great safety/efficacy balance both in vitro and in animal studies. GB261 exhibited high affinity to CD20 and ultra-low affinity to CD3. It showed comparable T cell activation and reduced cytokine secretion compared to a benchmark antibody (BM). GB261-induced ADCC and CDC only killed CD20+ cells but not CD3+ cells. It exhibited better RRCL cell killing than the BM in a PBMC engrafted, therapeutic treatment mouse model and good safety in cynomolgus monkeys. Thus, GB261 is a promising novel TEA against CD20+ cancers.">

        <tr id="Bispecific T-cell engaging therapies harness the immune system to elicit an effective anticancer response. Modulating the immune activation avoiding potential adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a critical aspect to realizing the full potential of this therapy. The use of suitable exogenous intervention strategies to mitigate the CRS risk without compromising the antitumoral capability of bispecific antibody treatment is crucial. To this end, computational approaches can be instrumental to systematically exploring the effects of combining bispecific antibodies with CRS intervention strategies. Here, we employ a logical model to describe the action of bispecific antibodies and the complex interplay of various immune system components and use it to perform simulation experiments to improve the understanding of the factors affecting CRS. We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the comedications that could ameliorate CRS without impairing tumor clearance. Our results agree with publicly available experimental data suggesting anti-TNF and anti-IL6 as possible co-treatments. Furthermore, we suggest anti-IFNγ as a suitable candidate for clinical studies.">

        <tr id="Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a lethal adverse event in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy, hindering this promising therapy for cancers, such as B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B‐ALL). Clinical management of CRS requires a better understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, a computational model of CRS during CAR T‐cell therapy is built to depict how the cellular interactions among CAR T‐cells, B‐ALL cells, and bystander monocytes, as well as the accompanying molecular interactions among various inflammatory cytokines, influence the severity of CRS. The model successfully defines the factors related to severe CRS and studies the effects of immunomodulatory therapy on CRS. The use of the model is also demonstrated as a precision medicine tool to optimize the treatment scheme, including personalized choice of CAR T‐cell products and control of switchable CAR T‐cell activity, for a more efficient and safer immunotherapy. This new computational oncology model can serve as a precision medicine tool to guide the clinical management of CRS during CAR T cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a group of unconventional T cells that mainly recognize bacterial vitamin B metabolites presented on MHC-related protein 1 (MR1). MAIT cells have been shown to play an important role in controlling bacterial infection and in responding to viral infections. Furthermore, MAIT cells have been implicated in different chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. Despite their involvement in different physiological and pathological processes, a deeper understanding of MAIT cells is still lacking. Arguably, this can be attributed to the difficulty of quantifying and measuring MAIT cells in different biological samples which is commonly done using flow cytometry-based methods and single-cell-based RNA sequencing techniques. These methods mostly require fresh samples which are difficult to obtain, especially from tissues, have low to medium throughput, and are costly and labor-intensive. To address these limitations, we developed sequence-to-MAIT (Seq2MAIT) which is a transformer-based deep neural network capable of identifying MAIT cells in bulk TCR-sequencing datasets, enabling the quantification of MAIT cells from any biological materials where human DNA is available. Benchmarking Seq2MAIT across different test datasets showed an average area-under-the-receiver-operator-curve (AU[ROC]) >0.80. In conclusion, Seq2MAIT is a novel, economical, and scalable method for identifying and quantifying MAIT cells in virtually any biological sample.">

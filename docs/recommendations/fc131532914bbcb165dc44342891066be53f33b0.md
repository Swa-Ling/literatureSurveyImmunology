 To improve diagnoses and further our understanding of functional defects in subjects with primary immunodeficiency (PI) diseases, we developed a new screen to broadly study the signaling of defective human immune responses to infections. Using time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and phospho-specific antibodies, we simultaneously examined the major signaling pathways of all circulating innate and adaptive immune cell types in response to cytokines and TLR agonists to identify signaling responses. We studied healthy controls and developed software tools to generate a systematic map of signaling responses. CyTOF successfully recapitulated established signaling responses, and further, elucidated new pathways that would not have been appreciated with traditional studies. Signaling map of controls was compared to maps generated by analyzing PI subjects with gain-of-function STAT1 and autosomal dominant STAT3 deficiency diseases. CyTOF allowed us to perform unbiased studies to uncover many ex-vivo signaling defects simultaneously to better understand how known genetic etiologies manifest functionally, and exactly which cell subtypes are affected. We identified more glaring defective signaling responses in these subjects aside from the canonical defects, elucidating the true breadth of cell subtypes and pathways affected. Broad, unbiased, functional analysis can complement whole exome sequencing to facilitate identification of novel or rare immune diseases. Comprehensive view of signaling across all immune cell subsets facilitates learning more about abnormal signaling patterns that confer susceptibility to infection or autoimmunity, improving our understanding of immune responses and can lead to new therapies.">

        <tr id="Summary
In solid-organ transplant recipients, a delicate balance between immunosuppression and immunocompetence must be achieved, which can be difficult to monitor in real-time. Shotgun sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been recently proposed as a new way to indirectly assess immune function in transplant recipients through analysis of the status of the human virome. To facilitate exploration of the utility of the human virome as an indicator of immune status, and to enable rapid, straightforward analyses by clinicians, we developed a fully automated computational pipeline, EzMap, for performing metagenomic analysis of the human virome. EzMap combines a number of tools to clean, filter, and subtract WGS reads by mapping to a reference human assembly. The relative abundance of each virus present is estimated using a maximum likelihood approach that accounts for genome size, and results are presented with interactive visualizations and taxonomy-based summaries that enable rapid insights. The pipeline is automated to run on both workstations and computing clusters for all steps. EzMap automates an otherwise tedious and time-consuming protocol and aims to facilitate rapid and reproducible insights from cfDNA.

        <tr id="We have developed a full genome virus detection process that combines sensitive nucleic acid preparation optimised for virus identification in fecal material with Illumina MiSeq sequencing and a novel post-sequencing virus identification algorithm. Enriched viral nucleic acid was converted to double-stranded DNA and subjected to Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The resulting short reads were processed with a novel iterative Python algorithm SLIM for the identification of sequences with homology to known viruses. De novo assembly was then used to generate full viral genomes. The sensitivity of this process was demonstrated with a set of fecal samples from HIV-1 infected patients. A quantitative assessment of the mammalian, plant, and bacterial virus content of this compartment was generated and the deep sequencing data were sufficient to assembly 12 complete viral genomes from 6 virus families. The method detected high levels of enteropathic viruses that are normally controlled in healthy adults, but may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and will provide a powerful tool for virus detection and for analyzing changes in the fecal virome associated with HIV-1 progression and pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Understanding the link between the human gut virome and diseases has garnered significant interest in the research community. Extracting virus-related information from metagenomic sequencing data is crucial for unravelling virus composition, host interactions, and disease associations. However, current metagenomic analysis workflows for viral genomes vary in effectiveness, posing challenges for researchers seeking the most up-to-date tools. To address this, we present ViromeFlowX, a user-friendly Nextflow workflow that automates viral genome assembly, identification, classification, and annotation. This streamlined workflow integrates cutting-edge tools for processing raw sequencing data for taxonomic annotation and functional analysis. Application to a dataset of 200 metagenomic samples yielded high-quality viral genomes. ViromeFlowX enables efficient mining of viral genomic data, offering a valuable resource to investigate the gut virome’s role in virus-host interactions and virus-related diseases.">
